controversial and made necessary large studies . The European R and omized study of Screening for Prostate cancer ( ERSPC ) was initiated in 1994 . Eight countries including France are participating . METHODS ERSPC is a multicentric r and omised study and started with the aim to determine whether a 20 % reduction in prostate cancer mortality can be achieved with PSA-based screening .  Men aged 50 - 74 and living in the Tarn or H\\u00e9rault were included . After r and omization and exclusion of men who died or had a prostate cancer were invited to participate by giving their consent and had a PSA test . In case of PSA greater than or equal to 3 ng/ml , biopsy was recommended . Included men in both screening and control group were followed through cancer registries . Objective was to present first round results of French participation to ERSPC , to determine factors of participation and to compare detected cancers cases between both groups . RESULTS Population of men included was 84,781 and were r and omized in screening ( n=42,590 ) or control ( n=42,191 ) group .  Participation rate was 36.9 % in Tarn and 24.3 % in H\\u00e9rault . PSA was greater than or equal to 3 ng/ml in 15,4 % of cases ( n=1812 ) and 45.9 % of men ( n=832 ) who were biopsied . Age , previous PSA performed within two years prior to invitation , health insurance and department of residence were significantly associated to participation rate . Cumulated incidence with a four years follow-up was 2.48 % ( n=1053 ) in screening and 1.99 % ( n=840 ) in control group , with a relative risk ( RR ) of 1.242 . Corresponding RR for Tarn and H\\u00e9rault were 1.37 and 1.20 respectively . Clinical parameters and treatments modalities were similar between both screening and control groups ( radical prostatectomy 68 % and radiation therapy 20 % ) . CONCLUSION Participation rate at first round was modest . Profile of men who participated compared to men who did not were different . The control group was probably contaminated by PSA testing outside study protocol . Consequences at ERSPC level of this low participation rate on final analysis remain to be determined', 'The objectives of the Prostate , Lung , Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial are to determine in screenees ages 55 - 74 at entry whether screening with flexible sigmoidoscopy ( 60-cm sigmoidoscope ) can reduce mortality from colorectal cancer , whether screening with chest X-ray can reduce mortality from lung cancer , whether screening men with digital rectal examination ( DRE ) plus serum prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) can reduce mortality from prostate cancer , and whether screening women with CA125 and transvaginal ultrasound ( TVU ) can reduce mortality from ovarian cancer . Secondary objectives are to assess screening variables other than mortality for each of the interventions including sensitivity , specificity , and positive predictive value ; to assess incidence , stage , and survival of cancer cases ; and to investigate biologic and /or prognostic characterizations of tumor tissue and biochemical products as intermediate endpoints . The design is a multicenter , two-armed , r and omized trial with 37,000 females and 37,000 males in each of the two arms . In the intervention arm , the  PSA and CA125 tests  are performed at entry , then annually for 5 years . The  DRE , TVU , and chest X-ray exams  are performed at entry and then annually for 3 years . Sigmoidoscopy is performed at entry and then at the 5-year point . Participants in the control arm follow their usual medical care practice s. Participants will be followed for at least 13 years from r and omization to ascertain all cancers of the prostate , lung , colorectum , and ovary , as well as deaths from all causes . A pilot phase was undertaken to assess the r and omization , screening , and data collection procedures of the trial and to estimate design parameters such as compliance and contamination levels . This paper describes eligibility , consent , and other design features of the trial , r and omization and screening procedures , and an outline of the follow-up procedures . Sample -size calculations are reported , and a data analysis plan is presented', 'BACKGROUND Prostate cancer ( PC ) screening with prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) has been shown to decrease PC mortality by the European R and omized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer ( ERSPC ) . We evaluated mortality results in the Finnish Prostate Cancer Screening Trial , the largest component of ERSPC . The primary endpoint was PC-specific mortality . METHODS A total of 80 144 men were identified from the population registry and r and omized to either a  screening arm ( SA ) or a  control arm ( CA ) . Men in the SA were invited to serum PSA determination up to three times with a 4-year interval between each scan and referred to biopsy if the PSA concentration was greater than or equal to 4.0 ng/mL or 3.0 to 3.99 ng/mL with a free/total PSA ratio less than or equal to 16 % . Men in the CA received usual care . The analysis covers follow-up to 12 years from r and omization for all men . Hazard ratios ( HRs ) were estimated for incidence and mortality using Cox proportional hazard model . All statistical tests were two-sided . RESULTS PC incidence was 8.8 per 1000 person-years in the SA and 6.6 in the CA ( HR = 1.34 , 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] = 1.27 to 1.40 ) . The incidence of advanced PC was lower in the SA vs CA arm ( 1.2 vs 1.6 , respectively ; HR = 0.73 , 95 % CI = 0.64 to 0.82 ; P < .001 ) . For PC mortality , no statistically significant difference was observed between the SA and CA ( HR = 0.85 , 95 % CI = 0.69 to 1.04 ) ( with intention-to-screen analysis ) . To avoid one PC death , we needed to invite 1199 men to screening and to detect 25 PCs . We observed no difference in all-cause mortality between trial arms . CONCLUSIONS At 12 years , a relatively conservative screening protocol produced a small , non-statistically significant PC-specific mortality reduction in the Finnish trial , at the cost of moderate overdiagnosis', 'BACKGROUND Prostate cancer is one of the leading causes of death from malignant disease among men in the developed world . One strategy to decrease the risk of death from this disease is screening with prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) ; however , the extent of benefit and harm with such screening is under continuous debate . METHODS In December , 1994 , 20,000 men born between 1930 and 1944 , r and omly sample d from the population register , were r and omised by computer in a 1:1 ratio to either a screening group invited for PSA testing every 2 years ( n=10,000 ) or to a control group not invited ( n=10,000 ) . Men in the screening group were invited up to the upper age limit ( median 69 , range 67 - 71 years ) and only men with raised PSA concentrations were offered additional tests such as digital rectal examination and prostate biopsies . The primary endpoint was prostate-cancer specific mortality , analysed according to the intention-to-screen principle . The study is ongoing , with men who have not reached the upper age limit invited for PSA testing . This is the first planned report on cumulative prostate-cancer incidence and mortality calculated up to Dec 31 , 2008 . This study is registered as an International St and ard R and omised Controlled Trial IS RCT N54449243 . FINDINGS In each group , 48 men were excluded from the analysis because of death or emigration before the r and omisation date , or prevalent prostate cancer . In men r and omised to screening , 7578 ( 76 % ) of 9952 attended at least once . During a median follow-up of 14 years , 1138 men in the screening group and 718 in the control group  were diagnosed with prostate cancer , result ing in a cumulative prostate-cancer incidence of 12.7 % in the screening group and 8.2 % in the  control  group ( hazard ratio 1.64 ; 95 % CI 1.50 - 1.80 ; p<0.0001 ) . The absolute cumulative risk reduction of death from prostate cancer at 14 years was 0.40 % ( 95 % CI 0.17 - 0.64 ) , from 0.90 % in the control group to 0.50 % in the screening group . The rate ratio for death from prostate cancer was 0.56 ( 95 % CI 0.39 - 0.82 ; p=0.002 ) in the screening compared with the control group . The rate ratio of death from prostate cancer for attendees compared with the control group was 0.44 ( 95 % CI 0.28 - 0.68 ; p=0.0002 ) . Overall , 293 ( 95 % CI 177 - 799 ) men needed to be invited for screening and 12 to be diagnosed to prevent one prostate cancer death . INTERPRETATION This study shows that prostate cancer mortality was reduced almost by half over 14 years . However , the risk of over-diagnosis is substantial and the number needed to treat is at least as high as in breast-cancer screening programmes . The benefit of prostate-cancer screening compares favourably to other cancer screening programs .

Design Population based r and omised controlled trial . Setting Department of Urology , Norrk\\u00f6ping , and the South-East Region Prostate Cancer Register . Participants All men aged 50 - 69 in the city of Norrk\\u00f6ping , Sweden , identified in 1987 in the National Population Register ( n=9026 ) . Intervention From the study population , 1494 men were r and omly allocated to be screened by including every sixth man from a list of date s of birth . These men were invited to be screened every third year from 1987 to 1996 . On the first two occasions screening was done by digital rectal examination only . From 1993 , this was combined with prostate specific antigen testing , with 4 \\u00b5g/L as cut off . On the fourth occasion ( 1996 ) , only men aged 69 or under at the time of the investigation were invited . Main outcome measures Data on tumour stage , grade , and treatment from the South East Region Prostate Cancer Register . Prostate cancer specific mortality up to 31 December 2008 . Results In the four screenings from 1987 to 1996 attendance was 1161/1492 ( 78 % ) , 957/1363 ( 70 % ) , 895/1210 ( 74 % ) , and 446/606 ( 74 % ) , respectively . There were 85 cases ( 5.7 % ) of prostate cancer diagnosed in the screened group and 292 ( 3.9 % ) in the control group . The risk ratio for death from prostate cancer in the screening group was 1.16 ( 95 % confidence interval 0.78 to 1.73 ) . In a Cox proportional hazard analysis comparing prostate cancer specific survival in the control group with that in the screened group , the hazard ratio for death from prostate cancer was 1.23 ( 0.94 to 1.62 ; P=0.13 ) . After adjustment for age at start of the study , the hazard ratio was 1.58 ( 1.06 to 2.36 ; P=0.024 ) . Conclusions After 20 years of follow-up the rate of death from prostate cancer did not differ significantly between men in the screening group and those in the  control group . Trial registration Current Controlled Trials , IS RCT N06342431', 'BACKGROUND The effect of screening with prostate-specific-antigen ( PSA ) testing and digital rectal examination on the rate of death from prostate cancer is unknown . This is the first report from the Prostate , Lung , Colorectal , and Ovarian ( PLCO ) Cancer Screening Trial on prostate-cancer mortality . METHODS From 1993 through 2001 , we r and omly assigned 76,693 men at 10 U.S. study centers to receive either annual screening ( 38,343 subjects ) or usual care as the control ( 38,350 subjects ) . Men in the screening group were offered annual PSA testing for 6 years and digital rectal examination for 4 years . The subjects and health care providers received the results and decided on the type of follow-up evaluation . Usual care sometimes included screening , as some organizations have recommended . The numbers of all cancers and deaths and causes of death were ascertained . RESULTS In the screening group , rates of compliance were 85 % for PSA testing and 86 % for digital rectal examination . Rates of screening in the control group increased from 40 % in the first year to 52 % in the sixth year for PSA testing and ranged from 41 to 46 % for digital rectal examination . After 7 years of follow-up , the incidence of prostate cancer per 10,000 person-years was 116 ( 2820 cancers ) in the screening group and 95 ( 2322 cancers ) in the control group ( rate ratio , 1.22 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 1.16 to 1.29 ) . The incidence of death per 10,000 person-years was 2.0 ( 50 deaths ) in the screening group and 1.7 ( 44 deaths ) in the control group ( rate ratio , 1.13 ; 95 % CI , 0.75 to 1.70 ) . The data at 10 years were 67 % complete and consistent with these overall findings . CONCLUSIONS After 7 to 10 years of follow-up , the rate of death from prostate cancer was very low and did not differ significantly between the two study groups . ( Clinical Trials.gov number , NCT00002540 .', 'BACKGROUND The prostate component of the Prostate , Lung , Colorectal , and Ovarian ( PLCO ) Cancer Screening Trial was undertaken to determine whether there is a reduction in prostate cancer mortality from screening using serum prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) testing and digital rectal examination ( DRE ) . Mortality after 7 - 10 years of follow-up has been reported previously . We report extended follow-up to 13 years after the trial . METHODS A total of 76 685 men , aged 55 - 74 years , were enrolled at 10 screening centers between November 1993 and July 2001 and r and omly assigned to the intervention  ( organized screening of annual PSA testing for 6 years and annual DRE for 4 years ; 38 340 men ) and control ( usual care , which sometimes included opportunistic screening ; 38 345 men ) arms . Screening was completed in October 2006 . All incident prostate cancers and deaths from prostate cancer through 13 years of follow-up or through December 31 , 2009 , were ascertained . Relative risks ( RRs ) were estimated as the ratio of observed rates in the intervention and control arms , and 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs ) were calculated assuming a Poisson distribution for the number of events . Poisson regression modeling was used to examine the interactions with respect to prostate cancer mortality between trial arm and age , comorbidity status , and pretrial PSA testing . All statistical tests were two-sided . RESULTS Approximately 92 % of the study participants were followed to 10 years and 57 % to 13 years . At 13 years , 4250 participants had been diagnosed with prostate cancer in the intervention arm compared with 3815 in the control arm . Cumulative incidence rates for prostate cancer in the intervention and control arms were 108.4 and 97.1 per 10 000 person-years , respectively , result ing in a relative increase of 12 % in the intervention arm ( RR = 1.12 , 95 % CI = 1.07 to 1.17 ) . After 13 years of follow-up , the cumulative mortality rates from prostate cancer in the intervention and control arms were 3.7 and 3.4 deaths per 10 000 person-years , respectively , result ing in a non-statistically significant difference between the two arms ( RR = 1.09 , 95 % CI = 0.87 to 1.36 ) . No statistically significant interactions with respect to prostate cancer mortality were observed between trial arm and age ( P(interaction ) = .81 ) , pretrial PSA testing ( P(interaction ) = .52 ) , and comorbidity ( P(interaction ) = .68 ) . CONCLUSIONS After 13 years of follow-up , there was no evidence of a mortality benefit for organized annual screening in the PLCO trial compared with opportunistic screening , which forms part of usual care , and there was no apparent interaction with age , baseline comorbidity , or pretrial PSA testing', \\\"PURPOSE This clinical trial is aim ed at evaluating the impact of prostate cancer screening on cancer-specific mortality . SUBJECTS AND METHODS Forty-six thous and four hundred and eighty-six ( 46,486 ) men aged 45 - 80 years registered in the electoral roll of the Quebec city area were r and omized in 1988 between screening and no screening . Screening included measurement of serum prostatic specific antigen ( PSA ) using 3.0 ng/ml as upper limit of normal and digital rectal examination ( DRE ) at first visit . At follow-up visits , serum PSA only was used . RESULTS Seventy-four ( 74 ) deaths from prostate cancer occurred in the 14,231 unscreened controls while 10 deaths were observed in the screened group of 7,348 men during the first 11 years following r and omization . Median follow-up of screened men was 7.93 years . A Cox proportional hazards model of the age at death from prostate cancer shows a 62 % reduction ( P < 0.002 , Fisher 's exact test ) of cause-specific mortality in the screened men ( P = 0.005 ) . These results are in agreement with the continuous decrease of prostate cancer mortality observed in North America\\\", 'BACKGROUND The incidence of prostate cancer has increased substantially since it became common practice to screen asymptomatic men for the disease . The European R and omized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer ( ERSPC ) was initiated in 1993 to determine how prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) screening affects prostate cancer mortality . Variations in the screening algorithm , such as the interval between screening rounds , likely influence the morbidity , mortality , and quality of life of the screened population . METHODS We compared the number and characteristics of interval cancers , defined as those diagnosed during the screening interval but not detected by screening , in men in the screening arm of the ERSPC who were aged 55 - 65 years at the time of the first screening and were participating through two centers of the ERSPC : Gothenburg ( 2-year screening interval , n = 4202 ) and Rotterdam ( 4-year screening interval , n = 13301 ) . All participants who were diagnosed with prostate cancer through December 31 , 2005 , but at most 10 years after the initial screening were ascertained by linkage with the national cancer registries . A potentially life-threatening ( aggressive ) interval cancer was defined as one with at least one of the following characteristics at diagnosis : stage M1 or N1 , plasma PSA concentration greater than 20.0 ng/mL , or Gleason score greater than 7 . We used Mantel Cox regression to assess differences between rates of interval cancers and aggressive interval cancers at the two centers . All statistical tests were two-sided . RESULTS The 10-year cumulative incidence of all prostate cancers in Rotterdam versus Gothenburg was 1118 ( 8.41 % ) versus 552 ( 13.14 % ) ( P<.001 ) , the cumulative incidence of interval cancer was 57 ( 0.43 % ) versus 31 ( 0.74 % ) ( P = .51 ) , and the cumulative incidence of aggressive interval cancer was 15 ( 0.11 % ) versus 5 ( 0.12 % ) ( P = .72 ) . CONCLUSION The rate of interval cancer , especially aggressive interval cancer , was low in this study . The 2-year screening interval had higher detection rates than the 4-year interval but did not lead to lower rates of interval and aggressive interval prostate cancers', 'The extent of effective prostate\\u2010specific antigen ( PSA ) contamination in the Rotterdam section of the ongoing European R and omized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer ( ERSPC ) trial was evaluated and defined as when opportunistic PSA testing of \\u2265 3.0 ng/ml was followed by biopsy , similar to the regular procedure within the trial . Records of participants aged 55\\u201374 years at entry were linked to the regional data base of the general practitioner ( GP ) laboratory to obtain PSA tests requested by GPs in the period 1 July 1997 to 31 May 2000 ( 2.9 years ) , and to the national pathology data base to quantify the number of biopsies . All men r and omized were included , only those with prostate cancer screen\\u2010detected or clinical ly diagnosed before July 1997 were omitted from the analyses . 2,895 out of the 14,349 men ( 20.2 % ) in the control arm and 1,981 out of the 14,052 men ( 14.1 % ) in the screening arm were  PSA\\u2010tested  , at an average annual rate of 73 and 52 per 1,000 person\\u2010years , respectively . These rates were higher than those recorded at the national and regional levels , 33 and 38 per 1,000 person\\u2010years , respectively . Opportunistic PSA testing in the control arm reached a peak within the first months of r and omization , after which it decreased to around 70 per 1,000 person\\u2010years . An opposite pattern was observed in the screening arm , where participants already had received the scheduled screening within the trial . The proportion of men in the control arm with PSA \\u2265 3.0 ng/ml followed by biopsy and prostate cancer was 7\\u20138 % and 3 % , respectively ( 3 % and 0.4\\u20130.6 % in the screening arm ) , over the whole study period . Over a 4\\u2010year rescreening interval , the average PSA and effective contamination amount were approximately 28 % and 10 % , respectively . PSA testing in the control arm in the Rotterdam ERSPC section is high , but was not followed by a substantial increase in prostate biopsies . Although the reasons for ordering PSA test or indicating biopsy are unknown , effective PSA contamination in the Rotterdam ERSPC section is low and not likely to jeopardize the power of the trial . \\u00a9 2003 Wiley\\u2010Liss ,', 'OBJECTIVE To address if prostate cancer ( PCa ) screening decreases PCa mortality in the asymptomatic population , within the setting of the Spanish arm of the European R and omized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer ( ERSPC ) . MATERIAL AND METHODS From 1996 to 1999 , 4,278 men aged 45 - 70 years were recruited and r and omized to the screening arm ( PSA every 4 years , prostate biopsy when PSA \\u22653 ng/ml ) and control arm ( no tests ) . Date s and causes of death were collected on an annual basis . A Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to calculate overall and cancer-specific survival . RESULTS A total of 2,416 men were recruited in the screening arm and 1,862 in the control arm . Mean age was 57.8 years , median follow-up was 13.3 years . At the end of the follow-up period , 427 deaths ( 9 from PCa ) were observed . Survival analysis did not show any difference between the study arms with respect to overall and cancer-specific survival ( p=0.939 and p=0.544 respectively ) . Most relevant causes of death were malignant tumors ( 52.9 % ) , cardiovascular disease ( 17.3 % ) and respiratory ( 8.9 % ) . Only 2.1 % of deaths ( 0.2 % of all recruited men ) were due to PCa ( 2.5 % screening , 1.6 % control ) . CONCLUSIONS The Spanish arm of ERSPC failed to reproduce the long-term results shown in the whole study . No differences in mortality ( overall or cancer-specific ) were observed after 15 years of follow-up . PCa mortality was infrequent ( less than 1 % ) . These results suggest limited yield of PCa screening in our setting', 'Screening for prostate cancer ( PC ) remains a controversial issue despite some new evidence on the mortality benefits of PC screening . We conducted a prospect i ve , r and omized screening trial in Finl and to investigate whether screening decreases PC incidence . Here , we report the incidence results from three screening rounds during a 12-year period . Of the 80,144 men enrolled , 31,866 men were r and omized to the screening arm ( SA ) and invited for screening with prostate-specific antigen test ( cut-off 4.0 ng/ml ) every 4 years , while the remaining men formed the control arm ( CA ) that received no interventions . The mean follow-up time for PC incidence in both arms was over 9 years . The incidence rate of PC ( including screen-detected and interval cancers as well as cases among non participants ) was 9.1 per 1,000 person-years in the SA and 6.2 in the CA , yielding an incidence rate ratio ( IRR ) 1.5 ( 95 % confidence interval 1.4 - 1.5 ) . The incidence of advanced PC was 1.1 in the SA and 1.5 in the CA , IRR = 0.7 ( 0.6 - 0.8 ) and the difference emerges after 5 - 6 years of follow-up . The incidence of localized PC was 7.5 in the SA and 4.6 in the CA , IRR = 1.6 ( 1.5 - 1.7 ) . The results from our large population -based trial indicate that screening for PC decreases the incidence of advanced PC . When compared with the CA , the PC detected in the SA there were substantially more often localized , low- grade PCs due to overdiagnosis', \\\"To report the results from  Switzerl and 's participation in the ERSPC from 1998 ; importantly , epidemiological data showed that Switzerl and has one of the highest rates of morbidity and mortality from prostate cancer in the world . The local study protocol was accepted by the ethical committee and after the successful pilot study phase , the centre joined the ERSPC\\\", 'BACKGROUND Screening for prostate cancer ( PC ) with prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) has been shown to decrease mortality , but has adverse effects , such as false-positive ( FP ) screening results . We describe the frequency of FP results and assess their relation to subsequent screening attendance , test results and prostate cancer risk in a large r and omized trial . MATERIAL S AND METHODS We included data from five centres of the European R and omized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer , altogether over 61,000 screened men . Men were screened with PSA test at a 2 - 7 year interval depending on the centre ; PSA cut-off was 3.0 - 4.0 ng/ml . A positive screen with no histologically confirmed PC in biopsy within 1 year was defined as an FP result . RESULTS Of the 61,604 men who were screened at least once , 17.8 % had one or more FP result ( s ) . Almost 20 % of men who participated at all screening rounds had one or more FP result ( s ) . More than half of the men with an FP result had another FP if screened again . Men with FP results had a fourfold risk of PC at subsequent screen ( depending on the round , 10.0 % versus 2.6 - 2.7 % of men with negative screen , risk ratio 3.8 - 3.9 ) . The PCs following an FP result were in 92.8 % of cases localised and low- grade versus 90.4 % following a screen-negative result . CONCLUSIONS Our results show that FP results are common adverse effects in PC screening , as they affect at least one in six screened men . False-positive men are more prone to be diagnosed with PC but are also likely to have consistently high PSA levels', \\\"PURPOSE Estimates of prostate cancer-specific mortality ( PCSM ) were similar for men r and omly assigned to intervention compared with usual care  on the Prostate , Lung , Colorectal and Ovarian PC screening study . However , results analyzed by comorbidity strata remain unknown . PATIENTS AND METHODS Between 1993 and 2001 , of 76,693 men who were r and omly assigned to usual care or intervention at 10 US centers , 73,378 ( 96 % ) completed a question naire that inquired about comorbidity and prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) testing before r and om assignment . Fine and Gray 's multivariable analysis was performed to assess whether the r and omized screening arm was associated with the risk of PCSM in men with no or minimal versus at least one significant comorbidity , adjusting for age and prer and omization PSA testing . RESULTS After 10 years of follow-up , 9,565 deaths occurred , 164 from PC . A significant decrease in the risk of PCSM ( 22 v 38 deaths ; adjusted hazard ratio [ AHR ] , 0.56 ; 95 % CI , 0.33 to 0.95 ; P = .03 ) was observed in men with no or minimal comorbidity r and omly assigned to intervention versus usual care , and the additional number needed to treat to prevent one PC death at 10 years was five . Among men with at least one significant comorbidity , those r and omly assigned to intervention versus usual care did not have a decreased risk of PCSM ( 62 v 42 deaths ; AHR , 1.43 ; 95 % CI , 0.96 to 2.11 ; P = .08 ) . CONCLUSION Selective use of PSA screening for men in good health appears to reduce the risk of PCSM with minimal overtreatment\\\", 'The specific details of the French national programme are based on the design of a local mass screening programme .  Men in the screening group are repeatedly invited by mail to be screened while no information other that the national available guidelines on the use of prostate\\u2010specific antigen ( PSA ) is offered to the control group . The protocol includes r and omization before information and consent . In addition , knowledge of any pre\\u2010existing PSA test is obtained through the health insurance data base . This will allow separate analysis , if necessary , between groups with previous PSA testing ( low participation rate expected ) and without ( higher participation rate expected )', 'From 1992 - 2001 , 7 countries in Europe gradually recruited men for the European R and omised Screening for Prostate Cancer ( ERSPC ) trial . Centres recruit different age groups and have different design s for recruiting and countries have different underlying risks for prostate cancer . Recruitment has reached 163,126 men aged 55 - 69 at entry now . Our purpose was to calculate the power of the trial and at what point in time can statistically significant differences in prostate cancer mortality be expected . Recruitment data were collected from the screening centres .  We calculated the expected number of prostate cancer deaths in each follow-up year , based on national statistics and expected rate in trial entrants . The power was calculated using different assumptions on intervention effect and contamination rate and also if the ERSPC trial would cooperate with other trials . With an assumed 25 % intervention effect in men actually screened and a 20 % contamination rate , the trial will reach a power of 0.86 in 2008 . With an assumed intervention effect of 40 % , the power reaches 0.90 in 2003 - 2004 . Pooling data with those of the Prostate , Lung , Colorectal and Ovary ( PLCO ) trial early is expected to improve the power to 79 % ( 20 % intervention effect ) to 92 % ( 40 % intervention effect PLCO ) . Adding more centres with compliance rates lower than 45 % decreases the power of the trial . The ERSPC trial has sufficient power to detect a significant difference in prostate cancer mortality between the 2 arms if the true reduction in mortality by screening is 25 % or more or if contamination remains limited to 10 % if the true effect is 20 % or more . If early detection and treatment turns out to have a stronger effect as may be suggested by observational data , the ERSPC trial is likely to conclusively show that within the next 5 years', 'Two large\\u2010scale r and omized screening trials , the Prostate , Lung , Colorectal and Ovary ( PLCO ) cancer trial in the USA and the European R and omized Screening for Prostate Cancer ( ERSPC ) trial in Europe are currently under way , aim ed at assessing whether screening reduces prostate cancer mortality . Up to the end of 1998 , 102,691 men have been r and omized to the intervention arm and 115,322 to the control arm ( which represents 83 % of the target sample size ) from 7 European countries and 10 screening centers in the USA . The principal screening method at all centers is determination of  serum prostate\\u2010specific antigen ( PSA ) . The PLCO trial and some European centers use also  digital rectal examination ( DRE )  as an ancillary screening test . In the core age group ( 55\\u201369 years ) , 3,362 of 32,486 men screened ( 10 % ) had a  serum PSA concentration of 4 ng/ml or greater , which is 1 cut\\u2010off for biopsy ( performed in 84 % ) . An additional 6 % was referred for further assessment based on other criteria , with much less efficiency . Differences in PSA by country are largely attributable to the age structure of the study population . The mean age\\u2010specific PSA levels are lower in the PLCO trial ( 1.64 ng/ml [ in the age group 55\\u201359 years ] , 1.80 [ 60\\u201364 years ] and 2.18 [ 65\\u201369 years ) than in the ERSPC trial ( 1.28\\u20131.71 [ 55\\u201359 ] , 1.75\\u20132.87 [ 60\\u201364 ] and 2.48\\u20133.06 [ 65\\u201369 years ] ) . Detection rates at the first screen in the ERSPC trial range from 11 to 42/1,000 men screened and reflect underlying differences in incidence rates and screening procedures . In centers with consent to r and omization design , adherence in the screening arm is 91 % , but less than half of the men in the target population are enrolled in the trial . In population \\u2010based centers in which men were r and omized prior to consent , all eligible subjects are enrolled , but only about two\\u2010thirds of the men in the intervention arm undergo screening . Considerable progress has been made in both trials . Enrollment will be completed in 2001 . A substantial number of early prostate cancers have been detected . The differences between countries seem to reflect both underlying prostate cancer incidence and screening policy . The trials have the power to show definitive results in 2005\\u20132008 . \\u00a9 2002 Wiley\\u2010Liss ,', \\\"Prostate cancer has become the most frequent cancer and the second cause of cancer mortality in men . This public health problem is becoming increasingly important due to the increasing life expectancy . At the present time , prostate cancer will be discovered in one in every eight men during their lifetime . Prostate cancer represents 25 % of all new cases of male cancers . Prostate cancer screening is design ed to detect early stage , asymptomatic prostate cancer , as the patient 's chances of cure are higher when the cancer is diagnosed at an early stage . The conclusions of the ANAES evaluation in 1998 did not recommend mass screening for prostate cancer . Several international prospect i ve r and omized studies based on serum PSA assay , sometimes associated with digital rectal examination , are currently underway . France is participating in the European ERSPC study ( European R and omized Study of Screening for Cancer Prostate ) and is organizing a national study on high-risk population s. While waiting for the final results of these studies , a recommendation needs to be proposed to inform general practitioners and specialists about optimal use of the currently available tests . Based on the conclusions of its oncology committee ( composed of urologists , medical oncologists , radiotherapists , pathologists and radiologists ) , the Association Fran\\u00e7aise d'Urologie proposes a recommendation concerning prostate cancer screening and defines its modalities , especially concerning the target population , screening tests and the information given to men before screening . The Association Fran\\u00e7aise d'Urologie recommends prostate cancer screening by PSA assay ( prostate specific antigen ) and digital rectal examination annually between the ages of 50 and 75 years , and from the age of 45 years in men with a family or ethnic risk . If total PSA is above the normal value of the test or if digital rectal examination is abnormal , referral to a urologist is recommended . Information concerning the limits , benefits and risks of screening and the available treatment options must be given before performing these examinations\\\", 'OBJECTIVE To test the feasibility of a population -based prostate cancer screening programme in general practice and explore the outcome after a 15-year follow-up period . METHODS From the total population of men aged 50 - 69 years in Norrk\\u00f6ping ( n = 9026 ) every sixth man ( n = 1494 ) was r and omly selected to be screened for prostate cancer every third year over a 12-year period . The remaining 7532 men were treated as controls . In 1987 and 1990 only  digital rectal examination ( DRE )  was performed , in 1993 and 1996 DRE was combined with a test for Prostate-Specific Antigen ( PSA ) .  TNM categories , grade of malignancy , management and cause of death were recorded in the South-East Region Prostate Cancer Register . RESULTS There were 85 ( 5.7 % ) cancers detected in the screened group ( SG ) , 42 of these in the interval between screenings , and 292 ( 3.8 % ) in the unscreened group ( UG ) . In the SG 48 ( 56.5 % ) of the tumours and in the UG 78 ( 26.7 % ) were localised at diagnosis ( p < 0.001 ) . In the SG 21 ( 25 % ) and in the UG 41 ( 14 % ) received curative treatment . There was no significant difference in total or prostate cancer-specific survival between the groups . CONCLUSIONS Although PSA had not been introduced in the clinical practice at the start of the study , we were still able to show that it is possible to perform a long-term population -based r and omised controlled study with st and ardised management and that screening in general practice is an efficient way of detecting prostate cancer whilst it is localised . Complete data on stage , treatment and mortality for both groups was obtained from a vali date d cancer register , which is a fundamental prerequisite when assessing screening programmes', 'OBJECTIVE To describe the natural history of initially untreated early-stage prostate cancer . A key secondary objective was to calculate long-term survival rates by stage , grade , and age at diagnosis . DESIGN Prospect i ve cohort study . SETTING Population -based in 1 county of Sweden , without screening for prostate cancer . PATIENTS A group of 642 patients with prostate cancer of any stage , consecutively diagnosed between 1977 and 1984 at a mean age of 72 years with complete follow-up to 1994 . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Proportion of patients who died from prostate cancer , and 15-year survival ( with 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] ) , corrected for causes of death other than prostate cancer . RESULTS In the entire cohort , prostate cancer accounted for 201 ( 37 % ) of all 541 deaths . Among 300 patients with a diagnosis of localized disease ( T0-T2 ) , 33 ( 11 % ) died of prostate cancer . In this group , the corrected 15-year survival rate was similar in 223 patients with deferred treatment ( 81 % ; 95 % CI , 72%-89 % ) and in 77 who received initial treatment ( 81 % ; 95 % CI , 67%-95 % ) . The corrected 15-year survival was 57 % ( 95 % CI , 45%-68 % ) in 183 patients with locally advanced cancer ( T3-T4 ) and 6 % ( 95 % CI , 0%-12 % ) in those 159 who had distant metastases at the time of diagnosis . CONCLUSION Patients with localized prostate cancer have a favorable outlook following watchful waiting , and the number of deaths potentially avoidable by radical initial treatment is limited . Without reliable prognostic indicators , an aggressive approach to all patients with early disease would entail substantial overtreatment . In contrast , patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease need trials of aggressive therapy to improve their poor prognosis', 'PURPOSE We evaluated long-term survival in attendees and nonattendees of a 1-time screening for prostate cancer . MATERIAL S AND METHODS A total of 2,400 men 55 to 70 years old in 1988 were r and omly selected and invited to a screening for prostate cancer . Of the invited men 1,782 ( 74 % ) attended . Screening attendees were examined with digital rectal examination , transrectal ultrasound and prostate specific antigen analysis .  When cancer was suspected , prostate biopsies were taken . A total of 65 men with prostate cancer were detected by this procedure . The entire source population comprising 27,204 men , including 618 nonattendees ( 26 % ) , was followed for prostate cancer diagnosis and survival for 15 years . RESULTS Incidence rate ratios were calculated using Poisson regression models . We found no effect of this screening procedure on the risk of death from prostate cancer and other causes of death ( incidence rate ratio 1.10 , 95 % CI 0.83 - 1.46 and 0.98 , 95 % CI 0.92 - 1.05 , respectively ) when comparing all invited men with the source population . However , attending the screening program was associated with a significantly decreased risk of death from causes other than prostate cancer ( vs source population incidence rate ratio 0.82 , 95 % CI 0.76 - 0.90 ) . In contrast , the corresponding incidence rate ratio in nonattendees was 1.53 ( 95 % CI 1.37 - 1.71 ) . CONCLUSIONS We found no evidence of a beneficial effect of this specific screening procedure but strong evidence of a difference in overall survival in screening attendees and nonattendees . These findings should be considered when interpreting previous and upcoming studies of the effect of screening programs', 'OBJECTIVES R and omized controlled trials are currently conducted to assess whether the mortality from prostate cancer is reduced by early detection with the use of prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) measurements in serum . To be effective , such a program should be able to reduce the absolute number of men diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer ( for which no cure is available ) . The aim of the present report is to evaluate whether PSA-based screening reduces the risk of being diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer .

Ten thous and , r and omly selected men aged 50 - 66 yr were invited for biennial PSA testing , with 10,000 men serving as passive controls for whom diagnosis of metastatic prostate cancer was monitored by using the Swedish Cancer Registry . RESULTS After a follow-up of 10 yr , the risk of being diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer was reduced by 48.9%-that is , decreasing from 47 cases in the control group to 24 cases in the group r and omized to PSA-based screening ( p=0.0084 ) . However , the risk of being diagnosed with prostate cancer increased 1.8-fold with PSA-based screening . CONCLUSIONS Biennial PSA screening reduces the risk of being diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer , the first prerequisite for achieving decreased cancer mortality  in younger men . This putative benefit is balanced by a 1.8-fold increased risk for diagnosis of prostate cancer', 'To report the initial results from Sweden of a large population \\u2010based r and omized study of screening using prostate\\u2010specific antigen ( PSA ) to detect prostate cancer , as the efficacy of such screening to decrease prostate cancer mortality has not yet been proven', 'BACKGROUND Evidence from r and omized trials on the effects of screening for prostate cancer ( PCa ) on disease-specific mortality accumulates slowly with increasing follow-up .

DESIGN , SETTING , AND PARTICIPANTS A r and omized controlled trial with r and omization after signed , written informed consent ( efficacy trial ) . In the period 1993 - 1999 , a total of 42 376 men aged 54 - 74 yr were r and omized to a screening arm ( S-arm )  ( n = 21 210 with screening every 4 yr , applying a total prostate-specific antigen [ PSA ] level cut-off \\u2265 3.0 ng/ml as biopsy indication ) or a control arm ( C-arm ) ( n = 21 166 ; no intervention ) . OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Number of PCas detected per arm depicted by predefined time periods and prognostic groups . PCa-specific mortality analyses using Poisson regression in age group 55 - 74 yr at r and omization and separately in the predefined age group of 55 - 69 yr . RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS After a median follow-up of 12.8 yr , 19 765 men ( 94.2 % ) were screened at least once and 2674 PCas were detected ( of which 561 [ 21.0 % ] were interval PCas ) . In the C-arm , 1430 PCas were detected , result ing in an excess incidence of 59 PCas per 1000 men r and omized ( 61 PCas per 1000 in age group 55 - 69 yr ) . Thirty-two percent of all men r and omized have died . PCa-specific mortality relative-risk ( RR ) reductions of 20.0 % overall ( age : 55 - 74 yr ; p = 0.042 ) and 31.6 % ( age : 55 - 69 yr ; p = 0.004 ) were found . A 14.1 % increase was found in men aged 70 - 74 yr ( not statistically significant ) . Absolute PCa mortality was 1.8 per 1000 men r and omized ( 2.6 per 1000 men r and omized in age group 55 - 69 yr ) . The number needed to invite and number needed to manage were 565 and 33 , respectively , for age group 55 - 74 yr , and 392 and 24 , respectively , for age group 65 - 69 yr . Given the slow natural history of the disease , follow-up might be too short . CONCLUSIONS Systematic PSA-based screening reduced PCa-specific mortality by 32 % in the age range of 55 - 69 yr . The roughly twofold higher incidence in the S-arm underlines the importance of tools to better identify those men who would benefit from screening']\",\n          \"[\\\"BACKGROUND There is increased pressure on primary care physicians to monitor oral anticoagulation . OBJECTIVE To test the null hypothesis that oral anticoagulation care can be provided at least as well in primary care through a nurse-led clinic , involving near-patient testing and computerized decision support software , compared with routine hospital management based on a variety of clinical outcome measures . METHODS A r and omized , controlled trial in 12 primary care practice s in Birmingham , Engl and ( 9 intervention and 3 control ) . Two control population s were used :  patients individually r and omly allocated as controls in the intervention practice s ( intra practice controls ) and all patients in control practice s ( inter practice controls ) . Intervention practice s ' patients were r and omized to the intervention ( practice -based anticoagulation clinic ) or control ( hospital clinic ) group . The main outcome measure was therapeutic control of the international normalized ratio . RESULTS Three hundred sixty-seven patients were recruited ( 122 intervention patients , 102 intra practice control patients , and 143 inter practice control patients ) . St and ard measures of control of the international normalized ratio ( point prevalence ) showed no significant difference between the intervention and control groups . Data on proportion of time spent in the international normalized ratio range showed significant improvement for patients in the intervention group ( paired t test , P = .008 ) . CONCLUSIONS Nurse-led anticoagulation clinics can be implemented in novice primary care setting s by means of computerized decision support software and near-patient testing . Care given by this model is at least as good as routine hospital follow-up . The model is generalizable to primary health care centers operating in developed health care systems\\\", 'OBJECTIVE To investigate the effect of meal-related self-monitoring of blood glucose on glycemic control and well-being in non-insulin-treated type 2 diabetic patients . RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS This 6-month study , which included 6 months of follow-up , adopted a prospect i ve , multicenter , r and omized controlled design . Subjects were r and omized to two groups : one group used a blood glucose-monitoring device , kept a blood glucose/eating diary , and received st and ardized counseling ; the control group received nonst and ardized counseling on diet and lifestyle . The primary efficacy parameter was the change in HbA(1c ) . Secondary efficacy variables included changes in body weight , lipids , and microalbumin and changes in treatment satisfaction and well-being . RESULTS In the per- protocol analysis , the use of a self-monitoring blood glucose device significantly reduced HbA(1c ) levels by 1.0 + /- 1.08 % compared with 0.54 + /- 1.41 % for the control group ( P = 0.0086 ) ; subgroup analysis showed three types of responders . Body weight , total cholesterol , and microalbumin improved when using a glucometer , but there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups . Treatment satisfaction increased in both groups to a similar extent ( P = 0.9 ) . Self-monitoring result ed in a marked improvement of general well-being with significant improvements in the subitems depression ( P = 0.032 ) and lack of well-being ( P = 0.02 ) . CONCLUSIONS Meal-related self-monitoring of blood glucose within a structured counseling program improved glycemic control in the majority of non-insulin-treated type 2 diabetic patients in this study . The finding of three types of responders will be important for future planning of counseling and educational interventions', 'Proper r and omisation means little if investigators can not include all r and omised participants in the primary analysis . Participants might ignore follow-up , leave town , or take aspartame when instructed to take aspirin . Exclusions before r and omisation do not bias the treatment comparison , but they can hurt generalisability . Eligibility criteria for a trial should be clear , specific , and applied before r and omisation . Readers should assess whether any of the criteria make the trial sample atypical or unrepresentative of the people in which they are interested . In principle , assessment of exclusions after r and omisation is simple : none are allowed . For the primary analysis , all participants enrolled should be included and analysed as part of the original group assigned ( an intent-to-treat analysis ) . In reality , however , losses frequently occur . Investigators should , therefore , commit adequate re sources to develop and implement procedures to maximise retention of participants . Moreover , research ers should provide clear , explicit information on the progress of all r and omised participants through the trial by use of , for instance , a trial profile . Investigators can also do secondary analyses on , for instance , per- protocol or as-treated participants . Such analyses should be described as secondary and non-r and omised comparisons . Mish and ling of exclusions causes serious method ological difficulties . Unfortunately , some explanations for mish and ling exclusions intuitively appeal to readers , disguising the seriousness of the issues . Creative mismanagement of exclusions can undermine trial validity', \\\"CONTEXT Control of oral anticoagulation therapy has been reported to often be inadequate . Previous retrospective investigations suggest that patients ' self-adjustment of oral anticoagulants may lead to improved control . OBJECTIVE To investigate the effects of patients ' self-management of oral anticoagulation therapy on accuracy of control and measures of treatment-related quality of life . DESIGN R and omized , single-blind , multicenter trial . SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS A total of 179 patients receiving long-term oral anticoagulation treatment were enrolled at 5 referral centers in Germany . INTERVENTION Patients were r and omized to an oral anticoagulation self-management group based on a structured treatment and teaching program and international normalized ratio ( INR ) self-monitoring . The control group received conventional care as provided by family physicians , including referral to specialists if necessary . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Deviation of INR values from the individual INR target range ( squared ) and the 5 categories of treatment-related quality of life . RESULTS Deviation of INR value from the mean of the INR target range was significantly lower in the intervention group at 3-month ( squared INR deviation , 0.59 vs 0.95 ; P<.001 ) and 6-month follow-up ( 0.65 vs 0.83 ; P=.03 ) compared with the control group . Also , the intervention group had INR values within the target range more often ( repeated measurement analysis for categorical data , P=.006 ) . The results were mainly due to less frequent suboptimal INR values in the intervention group ( 32.8 % vs 50.0 % [ P=.03 ] at 3-month , and 33.7 % vs 48.2 % [ P=.08 ] at 6-month follow-up ) . Treatment-related quality -of-life measures , especially treatment satisfaction scores , were significantly higher in the intervention group compared with controls . CONCLUSIONS An anticoagulation education program that includes self-management of anticoagulation therapy results in improved accuracy of anticoagulation control and in treatment-related quality -of-life measures . Further studies are needed to describe whether the program will reduce risk of bleeding or thromboembolism\\\", 'The goal of this study was to compare the relative efficacy and cost of self-monitoring of blood glucose ( SMBG ) with routine urine testing in the management of patients with type II ( non-insulin-dependent ) diabetes mellitus not treated with insulin . Fifty-four patients with type II diabetes mellitus , not treated with insulin , who had inadequate glucose control on diet aloneor diet and oral hypoglycemic agents were studied . Patients performed SMBG or urine glucose testing as part of a st and ardized treatment program that also included diet and exercise counseling . During the 6-mo study , both the urine-testing and SMBG groups showed similar improvement in glycemic control ; within each group , there were significant improvements in fasting plasma glucose ( reduction of 1.4 \\u00b1 3.2 mM , P < 0.03 ) and glycosylated hemoglobin ( reduction of 2.0 \\u00b1 3.4 % , P < 0.01 ) levels . Seventeen ( 31 % ) of54 patients actually normalized their glycosylated hemoglobin values , 9 in the urine-testing group and 8 in the SMBG group . Comparisons between the urine-testing and SMBG groups showed no significant differences in mean fasting plasma glucose ( P > 0.86 ) , glycosylated hemoglobin ( P > 0.95 ) , or weight ( P < 0.19 ) . In patients with type II diabetes mellitus not treated with insulin , SMBG is no more effective , but is 8\\u201312 times more expensive , thanurine testing in facilitating improved glycemic control . Our results do not support widespread use of SMBG in diabetic patients not treated with insulin', 'BACKGROUND Vitamin K antagonist treatment is effective for prevention and treatment of thromboembolic events but frequent laboratory control and dose-adjustment are essential . Small portable devices have enabled patient self-monitoring of anticoagulation and self-adjustment of the dose . We compared this self-management of oral anticoagulant therapy with conventional management by a specialist anticoagulation clinic in a r and omised cross-over study . METHODS 50 patients on long-term oral anticoagulant treatment were included in a r and omised controlled crossover study . Patients were self-managed or were managed by the anticoagulation clinic for a period of 3 months . After this period the alternative strategy was followed for each patient . Prothrombin time ( expressed as international normalised ratio [ INR ] ) were measured at intervals of 1 - 2 weeks in both periods without knowledge of type of management . The primary endpoint was the number of measurements within the therapeutic range ( therapeutic target value + /-50.5 INR units ) . FINDINGS There was no significant difference in the overall quality of control of anticoagulation between the two study periods . Patients were for 55 % and for 49 % of the treatment period within a range of + /-0.5 from the therapeutic target INR during self-management and anticoagulation clinic management , respectively ( p=0.06 ) . The proportion of patients who spent most time in the therapeutic target range was larger during self-management than during anticoagulation clinic-guided management . The odds ratio for a better control of anticoagulation ( defined as the period of time in the therapeutic target range ) during self-management compared with anticoagulation clinic-guided management was 4.6 ( 95 % CI 2.1 - 10.2 ) . A patient-satisfaction assessment showed superiority of self-management over conventional care . INTERPRETATION Self-management of INR in the population in this study is feasible and appears to result in control of anticoagulation that is at least equivalent to management by a specialist anticoagulation clinic . It is also better appreciated by patients . Larger studies are required to assess the effect of this novel management strategy on the incidence of thromboembolic or bleeding complications', 'BACKGROUND Self-management ( SM ) of warfarin by patients is an attractive strategy , particularly if it improves anticoagulation control and can be done safely under minimal physician supervision .

Patients 18 years of age and older were eligible if they were receiving warfarin for at least one month before enrolment and required anticoagulation for at least one year to a target international normalized ratio ( INR ) of 2.0 to 3.0 or 2.5 to 3.5 . Exclusion criteria were a known hypercoaguable disorder , mental incompetence , a language barrier or an inability to attend training sessions . Patients r and omly assigned to SM tested their INR using a point-of-care device ( Pro Time Microcogulation System , International Technidyne Corporation , USA ) and adjusted their warfarin doses using a nomogram . Patients r and omly assigned to PM received usual care from their general practitioner . The primary outcome was to demonstrate 20 % improvement in anticoagulation control by SM . RESULTS One hundred forty patients were r and omly assigned ( 70 per group ) . Thirteen patients dropped out of SM early due to an inability to self-manage . Based on intention-to-treat analysis , there was no difference in the proportion of INR in range ( SM 64.8 % versus PM 58.7 % , P=0.23 ) or time in target range ( SM 71.8 % versus PM 63.2 % , P=0.14 ) . Patients managing their own therapy spent less time below the therapeutic range ( 15.0 % versus 27.3 % , P=0.04 ) . There were three major complications of thrombosis or bleeding , all occurring in the PM arm . All patients who completed SM preferred to continue with that strategy . CONCLUSIONS SM was not significantly better than PM in maintaining therapeutic anticoagulation . SM was feasible and appeared safe in the present study population', \\\"A diabetes protocol characterized by self-monitoring of blood glucose was introduced in four general practice s with the aim of making the frequency of consultations dependent on the metabolic regulation and emphasizing body weight reduction . The feasibility of the programme was investigated and the results after 1 year were compared with those of conventional care in four control practice s. In the experimental practice s , 13 patients switched from a medical specialist 's to a general practitioner 's supervision  , 20 remained under supervision of their GP  and 33 started self-monitoring .  The self-monitoring rate , the consultation frequency according to protocol , the low number of dropouts and inadequate referrals and adherence to the therapeutic scheme showed that the protocol was feasible for both the GPs and the patients . At the initial assessment , the regulation of the diabetes was worse in patients of the experimental group , compared with those of the control group ( mean HbA1 9.7 % vs 8.9 % ; p less than 0.05 ) . On average , patients in the experimental group ( n = 56 ) lost 0.4 kg of body weight , whereas those in the control group ( n = 73 ) gained 0.1 kg ( n.s . ) . The mean change in HbA1 , adjusted for the initial value , was -0.4 % in the experimental and + 0.5 % in the control group ( p less than 0.05 ) . The results of the protocol can be attributed to a combination of greater participation of the patient , the individualized consultation frequency and the prescription of oral hypoglycaemic agents according to body weight development\\\", 'Self-monitoring of blood glucose levels is currently being recommended for obese patients with type II diabetes to improve weight loss and glycemic control . To determine whether self-monitoring of blood glucose levels improves dietary compliance in these patients , 50 obese patients with type II diabetes were r and omly assigned either to a st and ard behavioral weight control program or to a weight control program that included self-monitoring of blood glucose levels and focused on the weight-blood glucose relationship . Both groups lost significant amounts of weight and maintained their losses for at least one year ; reductions in medication could be made for 70 percent of patients . These data suggest that the behavioral weight control used in this study may be of benefit to patients with type II diabetes . However , there was no evidence that the addition of self-monitoring of blood glucose levels to the treatment program improved the outcome in terms of weight loss , reduction in medication , dietary compliance , or mood state', 'The objective of this open , r and omized , multicenter study is to investigate the benefits and economic efficiency of  self-management of oral anticoagulation in patients with atrial fibrillation ( SMAAF study ) in comparison with a group of patients given conventional care by a general practitioner or specialist . Two thous and patients suitable for self-management will be assigned at r and om to either the self-management group or the control group . The numbers of thromboembolic and hemorrhagic complications requiring treatment during the 2-year follow-up period will be recorded as the primary end point . The secondary endpoint variables will be maintenance of the INR value in the individual target range , INR variance , the course of complications over time , and the cost efficiency of self-management compared with the routine procedures . The last of these parameters will include the diagnostic and /or therapeutic measures carried out , the duration of inpatient hospital treatment , and the social consequences ( subsequent rehabilitation treatment , inability to work , forced retirement ) . The estimate of the required number of patients was based on the assumption that during long-term anticoagulant therapy within the framework of primary and secondary prevention 4 % of patients with chronic non-valvular atrial fibrillation would have severe thromboembolic of hemorrhagic complications each year . Since this rate can be halved by self-management , a one-tailed chi 2-test of 80 % power and a 5 % significance threshold would require n = 997 patients per group . The results of the SMAAF study will establish the socioeconomic benefits of self-management in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation', 'BACKGROUND Severe thromboembolic and hemorrhagic complications after mechanical heart valve replacement essentially depend on the intensity of oral anticoagulation and the fluctuation of individual international normalized ratio ( INR ) values . METHODS After heart valve replacement with Medtronic Hall , St. Jude Medical , and CarboMedics implants , patients were r and omly divided into two groups , one controlling INR values at home , the other being monitored by family practitioners . RESULTS Almost 80 % of the INR values recorded by patients at home were within the stipulated therapeutic range , INR 2.5 to 4.5 , compared with just 62 % of INR values recorded by family practitioners . The overall complication rate ( hemorrhages and thromboembolic events ) of the self-management group was significantly ( p < 0.05 ) decreased compared with the conventional group . CONCLUSIONS Through INR self-management , an improvement in the quality of ongoing oral anticoagulation could be shown . Starting this form of therapeutic control early after mechanical heart valve replacement appears to effect a further reduction in anticoagulant-induced complications', 'BACKGROUND Several studies have demonstrated that patient self-management of oral anticoagulant therapy ( OAT )  can improve treatment quality . However , most of these studies were not conducted within a specialized anticoagulation care system . The objective of the present study was to determine whether patient self-management of OAT improves the quality of care delivered by anticoagulation clinics . METHODS In this r and omized study by 2 Dutch anticoagulation clinics 341 patients aged between 18 and 75 years and receiving long-term OAT were divided into 4 groups : an existing routine care group of patients untrained in self-management ; a routine care group of trained patients ; a group managed weekly at an anticoagulation clinic where international normalized ratios were measured by trained patients ; and weekly patient self-management . A 2-step r and omization procedure was followed : first , a Zelen- design r and omization was performed to distribute patients ( without informing them ) to the existing care group or to receive training in self-management ; second , trained patients were r and omized to the 3 other study groups . RESULTS Only 25.6 % of invited patients agreed to participate in the training program . Patients who remained in the existing care group were within the international normalized ratio target range 63.5 % of the time . The type of coumarin taken was a major predicting factor of OAT quality . In all study groups phenprocoumon outperformed acenocoumarol by 11.6 % ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 6.6%-16.5 % ) . Weekly management with phenprocoumon led to a 6.5 % improvement ( 95 % CI , 0.0%-13.1 % ) in time in the international normalized ratio target range when patients were managed at an anticoagulation clinic and to an 8.7 % improvement ( 95 % CI , 1.6%-15.9 % ) when patients were self-managed . Weekly management with acenocoumarol did not improve the quality of OAT . CONCLUSION With selected patients , the quality of OAT obtained through patient self-management is at least as high as that delivered by specialized physicians at anticoagulation clinics . Weekly management of OAT with long-acting phenprocoumon has to be preferred at anticoagulation clinics or , where possible , through patient self-management', 'To study if self-monitoring of glucose , urinary or capillary , could help them to improve their metabolic control through better compliance to diet and /or hypoglycaemic agents , 208 non-insulin-treated poorly controlled diabetic patients were r and omized to : group A -- regular HbA1c determinations but no self-monitoring , group B -- self-urine glucose monitoring , twice every other day , group C -- self blood glucose monitoring , twice every other day , and followed six months . At the end of the study period , the decrease of HbA1c over six months -- main endpoint -- was not significantly different between the three groups ( mean + /- SEM ; group A : -0.5 + /- 0.2 % ; group B : -0.1 + /- 0.3 % ; group C : -0.4 + /- 0.3 % ) . However , the degree of compliance to  blood glucose self-monitoring  in group C appeared to relate to the outcome : a significant correlation was found between the number of blood glucose strips used and the decrease of HbA1c ( r = .36 , p less than .02 ) . We conclude that regular self-monitoring has no definite advantage over the usual management for improving metabolic control in non-insulin-treated diabetic patients , though it may possibly help patients ready to comply with its use', 'Self-monitoring of blood glucose  ( SBGM ) is widely recommended for both type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients despite the lack of evidence of benefit in glucose control or as an aid in weight loss in type 2 subjects . This study tested the hypothesis that combined use of SMBG and dietary carbohydrate ( CHO ) counting , using the blood monitoring results to shape dietary CHO quotas , is beneficial in managing type 2 diabetes . Twenty-three over-weight ( body mass index , BMI 27.5\\u201344 kg/m2 ) patients aged 40\\u201375 participated in a 28-week behavioral weight control program . Baseline hemoglobin HbA 1c ranged between 9.5 % and 13.5 % ( normal range 5.5%\\u20137.7 % ) . Subjects were matched for weight , sex , and HbAlc and assigned to small ( 4\\u20138 participants ) groups which met weekly for 12 weeks and then monthly for 16 weeks . After 8 weeks , the group were r and omized either to continue the behavioral program or to have SMBG and dietary CHO counting .  Glucose monitoring was performed 6 times daily ( pre- and 2h postpr and ially ) for the first month , focusing on the meal increment and correlating this to dietary CHO intake . Weight loss was identical in both groups during the year of follow-up . The HbA1c level showed a progressive decline in experimental subjects ( P<0.05 ) , whereas there was no improvement in control subjects', 'Abstract Objective To determine the clinical effectiveness of self management compared with routine care in patients on long term oral anticoagulants . Design Multicentre open r and omised controlled trial . Setting Midl and s region of the UK . Participants 617 patients aged over 18 and receiving warfarin r and omised to intervention ( n = 337 ) and routine care ( n = from 2470 invited ; 193/337 ( 57 % ) completed the 12 month intervention . Intervention Intervention patients used a point of care device to measure international normalised ratio twice a week and a simple dosing chart to interpret their dose of warfarin . Main outcome measure Percentage of time spent within the therapeutic range of international normalised ratio . Results No significant differences were found in percentage of time in the therapeutic range between self managment and routine care ( 70 % v 68 % ) . Self managed patients with poor control before the study showed an improvement in control that was not seen in the routine care group . Nine patients ( 2.8/100 patient years ) had serious adverse events in the self managed group , compared with seven ( 2.7/100 patient years ) in the routine care arm ( \\u03c72(df = 1 ) = 0.02 , P = 0.89 ) . Conclusion With appropriate training , self management is safe and reliable for a sizeable proportion of patients receiving oral anticoagulation treatment . It may improve the time spent the therapeutic range for patients with initially poor control . Trial registration IS RCT N 19313375', 'This study tested the hypothesis that follow-up intervention ( by telephone calls and home visit ) affects compliance in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus ( NIDDM ) . Sixty NIDDM patients were r and omly assigned to two groups \\u2014 a control group , which received the st and ard protocol ( 3-day educational program and a review session 1 month after the program ) ; and an intervention group , which received the st and ard protocol as well as a series offour telephone calls and one home visit by a registered nurse over a 3-month period .  Compliance to prescribed regimens was determined by analyzing three sets of data : changes in pre- to post study glycosylated hemoglobin ( HbA1c ) values ; changes in pre- to post study weight ; and frequency with which self-monitoring of blood glucose ( SMBG ) was practice d. Results showed that SMBG practice was significantly better for the intervention group . No significant differences were seen in post study HbA 1c values and weight changes between the two groups . Follow-up inter vention by telephone calls and home visit can enhance patient compliance to certain aspects of the prescribed diabetes management plan', 'STUDY OBJECTIVE To evaluate the efficacy and accuracy of monitoring prothrombin times at home . DESIGN R and omized , prospect i ve cohort study . SETTING Out patients discharged from a university hospital or a community hospital . PATIENTS Fifty patients started on warfarin for the first time who demonstrated an ability to use the monitor and who had not achieved a stable response to warfarin in the hospital . INTERVENTION Oral anticoagulation therapy managed using a portable prothrombin time monitor compared with specialized anticoagulation clinic care . MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS In the 46 patients who completed the 8-week study , the median percentage of time that patients in the home-monitor group ( n = 23 ) were within a range equal to the target prothrombin ratio + /- 0.3 , but always above 1.25 , was 93 % , compared with 75 % for patients in the clinic group ( n = 23 ) ( P = 0.003 ) . There was no significant difference between groups in the percentage of time above the therapeutic range ; however , the percentage of time that patients were subtherapeutic was significantly greater in the clinic group ( P less than 0.001 ) . There were no major thromboembolic or hemorrhagic complications in either group . Differences between home monitor measurements and corresponding clinical laboratory measurements using blood sample s drawn within 4 hours of the home test were comparable to differences observed between measurements using two different clinical laboratory instruments . CONCLUSIONS Use of a portable prothrombin time monitor by patients at home is feasible and provides accurate measurements . Patients doing home monitoring achieve superior anticoagulation control compared with those receiving st and ard anticoagulation clinic care', \\\"Context Although many out patients require oral anticoagulation , the optimal management of outpatient anticoagulation remains uncertain . Studies have demonstrated the feasibility of patient self-management using portable coagulometers , but the studies that compared patient outcomes with self-management and those with conventional management in an anticoagulation clinic did not find a better outcome with self-management . Contribution In this r and omized , controlled trial of 737 patients , patients assigned to self-management of anticoagulation achieved a similar level of control and had fewer adverse events than patients assigned to conventional management . Implication s Health care providers should begin to implement patient self-management of oral anticoagulation with portable coagulometers in mainstream practice . The Editors Indications for oral anticoagulant treatment to prevent thromboembolic disease have increased in recent years ( 1 ) . Prothrombin times must be monitored frequently in patients taking oral anticoagulants to determine the safest dose and to minimize the risk for complications . The clinical management of oral anticoagulant treatment improved greatly after the international normalized ratio ( INR ) was introduced as a measurement of anticoagulation intensity ( 1 ) . The establishment of accurate therapeutic INR ranges was also beneficial . Target ranges include the safest INR values that carry the lowest risk for hemorrhagic or thromboembolic complications ( 2 ) . Despite these improvements , however , serious complications are still associated with oral anticoagulant treatment ( 3 , 4 ) , and management by specialized staff at anticoagulation clinics seems to be safer than other clinical strategies in terms of numbers of complications ( 5 - 7 ) . Currently , portable coagulometers are available for determining INR easily and reliably ( 8) . This technology provides interesting clinical models for the control of oral anticoagulant treatment , the most promising of which are patient self-testing and patient self-management . For patient self-testing , patients measure INRs themselves and ask their referring physicians for the proper anticoagulant dose . Patient self-management assumes that patients will adjust their own doses and is the most autonomous strategy . Several published studies have compared these strategies with usual care ( that is , monitoring of oral anticoagulant treatment by practitioners ) ( 9 - 13 ) or with specialized anticoagulation clinics ( 14 - 18 ) . Although these studies showed that both patient self-testing and patient self-management are feasible , their sample s were relatively small ( 9 , 11 , 13 , 14 - 18 ) or included selected patients with mechanical valve prostheses ( 10 ) or patients older than 65 years of age ( 12 ) . In general , previous studies indicate that patient self-management may be superior to management by general practitioners or anticoagulation clinics in quality of INR control ( 10 - 18 ) . In addition , Krtke and Krfer ( 10 ) , Beyth and associates ( 12 ) , and Sawicki ( 13 ) reported a decrease in major complications among self-managed patients compared with patients managed by general practitioners . To date , no published data have suggested a better clinical outcome ( decrease in associated complications ) with patient self-management than with specialized management at an anticoagulation clinic ( 5 , 19 ) . We performed a r and omized , controlled trial to directly compare self-management of oral anticoagulant treatment , as evaluated in terms of efficacy and safety in unselected patients , with management in an anticoagulation clinic . Methods Study Design The Alternative Control of Oral Anticoagulant Treatment ( ACOA ) trial is a single-center , central ly r and omized , controlled study that was performed at Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau , Barcelona , Spain , from January 2001 to July 2002 . The hematologists who manage our anticoagulation clinic use a homogeneous dosing protocol and st and ard protocol s to manage situations that increase clinical risk . The clinical staff includes trained nurses . Computers control the clinical data and INR records , ensuring excellent follow-up . Patients and their relatives receive basic education at the beginning of oral anticoagulant treatment , including information on the main characteristics of oral anticoagulants , potential risks , rationale for periodic monitoring , and drug interactions . Samsa and Matchar ( 20 ) recommended that these characteristics be used to provide an appropriate control group in a trial on patient self-management . The institutional review board of our hospital approved the study . Recruitment Phase The recruitment phase began with computerized r and om selection of 1500 patients from the more than 5000 who were receiving oral anticoagulant treatment controlled in our hospital . We included any ambulatory patient 18 years of age or older who had been receiving long-term anticoagulant therapy for at least 3 months before entering the study . We excluded patients who were younger than 18 years of age , who had a severe physical or mental illness without a responsible caregiver , or who were of foreign origin and were unable to underst and Spanish . Once the patient ( or his or her caregiver ) agreed to participate , written informed consent was obtained . Next , central ized telephone r and omization assigned the patient to the experimental group ( patient self-management ) or to the control group ( conventional management ) . The allocation sequence was generated at the hospital 's epidemiology department , and the sequence of r and omization was concealed until the patient was assigned to a group . To facilitate comparability between study groups , this r and omization was stratified according to sex , age ( 70 years of age or < 70 years of age ) , and indication for oral anticoagulant treatment ( 4 groups ) . Members of our anticoagulation clinic enrolled participants and assigned them to groups . Baseline data included demographic details , clinical information on associated risk factors , other medications , previous length of anticoagulant therapy , bleeding or thromboembolic complications during oral anticoagulant treatment , and target INR range . Follow-up for patients assigned to the conventional management group was done immediately . Patients in the self-management group received a training course first , and follow-up was not performed until the nurse teaching the course judged that the patients had acquired a minimum of expertise in self-management . Training Course An educational program was design ed to optimize the number of patients able to underst and and safely perform  self-management  ( Appendix ) . It was similar to the German program developed by Sawicki ( 13 ) but was demographically adapted to the characteristics of the Spanish population , considering differences in daily schedules , diet , educational level , and other idiosyncratic factors . The program consisted of 2 sessions of 2 hours each on consecutive days . A specially trained nurse was responsible for teaching the patients in small , organized groups . The lessons included basic theoretical and practical concepts involving the use of a coagulometer , interpretation of INR , and adjustment of dose . The concepts of target range and dose modification were emphasized when necessary . A simple card system was design ed to help the patient select the correct dose . For each target range , a specific card was provided . Patients were taught to use the portable coagulometer CoaguChek S ( Roche Diagnostics , Mannheim , Germany ) with the appropriate reagent strips . Follow-up Phase Normally , the patients in the conventional management group visited our hospital every 4 weeks to check their INRs . When the INR result was out of target range , our dosing protocol indicated that we should advance the next appointment for INR testing to 1 or 2 weeks . International normalized ratio was determined by means of a st and ard KC 10 coagulometer ( Amelung , Lemgo , Germany ) . As a thromboplastin , we used Thromborel S ( Behring , Marburg , Germany ) . A hematologist experienced in oral anticoagulation management adjusted the dose and made the appointment for the next INR test . Patients in the self-management group performed the INR tests at home once per week using the CoaguChek S kit . They determined the appropriate dose of oral anticoagulant and the time of the next INR test . All of the INR results in both groups were entered into a computer ( in the central system of our anticoagulation clinic or in the portable coagulometers ) to facilitate data management . Patients in both groups were interviewed monthly by telephone to record any complications or changes in their health status . For the conventional management group , these interviews were done approximately midway between hospital visits . The questions addressed minor or major bleeding , thromboembolic events , episodic diseases , changes in long-term medications , and hospital stays . Associated complications were diagnosed and evaluated by a third physician who was not involved in the trial and was unaware of patients ' study group . St and ard criteria were used to diagnose any thromboembolic complications . Transient ischemic attack was diagnosed clinical ly by a neurologist , and superficial thrombophlebitis was diagnosed clinical ly by an angiologist . To diagnose stroke , arterial embolism , venous thromboembolism , pulmonary embolism , or valve thrombosis , we used widely accepted methods ( computed tomography or magnetic nuclear resonance imaging , angiography , surgical diagnosis , Doppler ultrasonography , phlebography , lung angiography or ventilation-perfusion lung scanning , cardiac ultrasonography , or fluoroscopy ) . All thromboembolic complications were considered major events . Life-threatening bleeding or bleeding requiring transfusion or hospital admission was considered a major event . Any other bleeding was considered a minor event . Statistical Analysis Study outcomes were evaluated on an intention-to-treat basis and also on an on-treatment basis .\\\", 'Of 125 patients aged 65 years or over , with atrial fibrillation taking warfarin for at least 12 months , with a st and ard deviation ( SD ) of prothrombin time , expressed as the International Normalized Ratio ( INR ) > 0\\u00b75 over the previous 6 months , 40 were r and omized to continue with usual clinic care and 85 to receive education about warfarin .  Of these , 44 were r and omized to self\\u2010monitor their INR and 41 returned to clinic . Compared with the previous 6 months there was a significant increase in percentage time within the therapeutic range for the 6 months following education [ 61\\u00b71 vs. 70\\u00b74 ; mean difference 8\\u00b78 ; 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) : \\u22120\\u00b72\\u201317\\u00b78 ; P = 0\\u00b7054 ] and following education and self\\u2010monitoring ( 57 vs. 71\\u00b71 ; mean difference 14\\u00b71 ; 95 % CI : 6\\u00b77\\u201321\\u00b75 ; P < 0\\u00b7001 ) , compared with those patients following usual clinic care ( 60\\u00b70 vs. 63\\u00b72 ; mean difference 3\\u00b72 ; 95 % CI : \\u22127\\u00b73\\u201313\\u00b77 ) . Using the same comparative periods , the INR SD fell by 0\\u00b724 ( P < 0\\u00b70001 ) in the group allocated to education and self\\u2010monitoring , 0\\u00b726 ( P < 0\\u00b70001 ) in the group receiving education alone and 0\\u00b716 ( P = 0\\u00b7003 ) in the control group . Inter\\u2010group differences were not statistically significant ( intervention groups 0\\u00b726 \\u00b1 0\\u00b730 vs. control 0\\u00b716 \\u00b1 0\\u00b73 , P = 0\\u00b710 ) . Quality \\u2010of\\u2010life measurements and health beliefs about warfarin were unchanged ( apart from emotional role limitation ) with education or education and self\\u2010monitoring .  Patient  education regarding anticoagulation therapy could be a cost\\u2010effective initiative and is worthy of further study', 'BACKGROUND This study was conducted to assess the ability of patients receiving heart valve replacements to practice self-managed anticoagulation using a portable coagulometer . METHODS We carried out a prospect i ve , r and omized trial , comparing self-managed anticoagulation with conventional management .  Patients practicing self-managed anticoagulation ( 51 patients ) did so at home , measuring their international normalized ratio and then deciding on their dosage of warfarin , while  conventionally controlled patients ( n = 49 ) attended hospital clinics or were managed by their family physicians . RESULTS We successfully trained 41 of 44 patients who agreed to self-manage their anticoagulant therapy ; 34 of the 41 managed their own anticoagulation at home for 2 years . Their control , assessed by a number of tests in range ( 67.6 % versus 58.0 % ) and time in therapeutic range ( 76.5 % versus 63.8 % ) , was significantly better than that for the group managed conventionally ( p < 0.0001 ) . There was no significant difference in mortality or morbidity between the two groups . CONCLUSIONS Self-managed anticoagulation is a reliable , easily learned method of controlling anticoagulation , and it is suitable for approximately two thirds of patients , with excellent results', \\\"Bleeding is the major side effect of warfarin and is a major deterrent to its use , especially in older patients . Older people are widely thought to be at increased risk for warfarin-related bleeding ( 1 - 8 ) , and they are less likely to be treated with warfarin , even when it has been proven efficacious , in part because of concern about risk for bleeding ( 9 - 13 ) . Efforts that reduce the frequency of major warfarin-related bleeding not only will increase the net benefit of therapy but also will facilitate more appropriate and widespread use of warfarin therapy in older patients . Methods for identifying patients at highest risk for bleeding have recently advanced ( 5 - 7 , 14 - 21 ) , and experience with specialized programs that coordinate the management of anticoagulant therapy suggests that clinical outcomes may be improved ( 6 , 14 , 18 , 22 - 27 ) . However , there is little controlled or experimental evidence on how to optimize management of anticoagulant therapy in older patients and prevent bleeding . We developed a multicomponent comprehensive program for management of warfarin therapy aim ed at improving control of the anticoagulant effect and reducing events ( such as use of an interacting medicine ) that might precipitate bleeding . We hypothesized that this intervention would be acceptable to most elderly persons starting warfarin therapy and would reduce the frequency of warfarin-related major bleeding . Methods Patients Patients hospitalized at University Hospitals of Clevel and , a 900-bed teaching hospital , between September 1992 and October 1995 who were 65 years of age or older and were receiving 10 000 units or more of intravenous unfractionated heparin every 24 hours were screened daily . Of these patients , we identified 426 persons who were 65 years of age or older , who resided in Cuyahoga County , Ohio , and for whom treatment with warfarin was planned for 10 or more days ( Figure 1 ) . Patients were excluded if they had been treated with warfarin at any time during the previous 6 months , were admitted from a nursing home , were enrolled in another clinical trial , were too ill to give consent and had no available surrogate , were discharged prematurely , or did not speak English ; if their private physician refused to participate ; or if no r and om allocation was taking place ( for example , during vacations or holidays ) . Eligible patients who were enrolled did not differ significantly from those who were not enrolled with regard to age , ethnicity , sex , or indication for therapy . Figure 1 . Eligibility and r and om assignment of patients . Patients were stratified according to their baseline risk for major bleeding by using the Outpatient Bleeding Risk Index ( 20 ) . This index includes four independent risk factors for  major bleeding :  age 65 years or older , history of gastrointestinal bleeding , history of stroke , and one or more of four specific comorbid conditions ( recent myocardial infa rct ion , hematocrit<30 % , creatinine concentration>133 mol/L [ 1.5 mg/dL ] , or diabetes mellitus ) . Patients with one or two risk factors were classified as intermediate risk , and those with three or more risk factors were classified as high risk ; estimated frequencies of major bleeding in 6 months were 6 % and 35 % , respectively . After stratification , patients were r and omly assigned to receive usual care or intervention . Informed consent for observation and data collection was then sought from both groups , and informed consent to participate in the intervention was sought from the intervention group . This method , initially proposed by Zelen ( 28 ) , allows the study to test the effectiveness of offering the intervention rather than simply the efficacy of the intervention in patients who consent to participation before r and om assignment . The sample size was calculated to provide 80 % power and an level of 0.05 . The study protocol and informed consent procedures were approved by the hospital 's institutional review board . Intervention The intervention had two main components . The first component consisted of a guideline -based consultation that assessed the patient 's indications for therapy and potential risk factors for warfarin-related bleeding .  We used this method previously to reduce the frequency of anticoagulant-related bleeding  during hospitalization ( 27 ) . Specific recommendations about modifiable risk factors , such as use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs , were made and implemented . The study investigators directed warfarin dosing and international normalized ratio ( INR ) testing after hospital discharge . The second component included patient education , coaching , and self-monitoring of prothrombin time ;  this component was grounded in social learning theory ( 29 - 31 ) and experimental evidence ( 32 , 33 ) showing that increasing participation of patients in their care can improve clinical outcomes but that increasing patient knowledge alone is insufficient ( 34 , 35 ) . Patient education consisted of one-on-one teaching by a lay educator using a specifically formatted workbook for older adults to teach them about warfarin , indications for its use , drug and food interactions , and the signs and symptoms of bleeding . The lay educator review ed the workbook and was taught how to use the prothrombin time monitor by one of the authors but had no formal medical training . Coaching was aim ed to increase patients ' participation in their care and to improve information-seeking skills . Patients were trained and encouraged to communicate more effectively with physicians and other health personnel about a range of issues , such as health concerns , drug interactions , or changes in lifestyle or diet . Finally , patients were taught to self-monitor the  prothrombin time by using a home portable monitor ( Coumatrak Protime Test System , Biotrack , Inc. , Mountain View , California ) . The monitor uses a fingerstick to obtain a blood sample and has well-established accuracy ( 36 - 38 ) . Patients were initially assessed , educated , and taught to use the portable monitor while hospitalized ; training lasted 30 minutes to 1 hour . They were seen daily while hospitalized , warfarin therapy was adjusted as needed , and any concerns or questions about anticoagulant therapy were addressed . Within 3 days of discharge from the hospital , the lay educator or study investigator made a home visit to assess patients ' use of the portable monitor and to check the  prothrombin time .  In general , patients were instructed to check their prothrombin time three times during the first week after hospital discharge , weekly for the remainder of the first month , and monthly thereafter depending on their results . Patients phoned in their results to the coach , who review ed the results with one of the investigators and provided same-day follow-up , including recommendations for dose and subsequent INR testing . Patients were instructed to call whenever they had questions or concerns about their  warfarin management or possible side effects , if they were hospitalized for any reason , or if they began receiving new medications . After the 6-month intervention period , management and dosing of warfarin therapy reverted back to patients ' personal physicians . Patients assigned to usual care received medical care , including management , dosing , and medical information , according to the discretion and practice s of their personal physician . Data Collection Trained abstract ors who were not involved with the intervention component of the study collected data from the medical chart at the start of anticoagulant therapy ; at each subsequent hospitalization ; and by blinded interview at enrollment and 1 , 3 , and 6 months after enrollment and every 6 months thereafter . Data elements included demographic characteristics , clinical history including comorbid diagnoses , indications for therapy , potential risk factors for bleeding , functional status , and new illnesses or comorbid conditions that developed after enrollment . Surveillance for bleeding and thromboembolism was conducted identically in the intervention and control groups and consisted of 12 items inquiring about bleeding and thromboembolism at each follow-up interview . Whenever an event was reported , the clinical characteristics of the bleeding or thromboembolic episode were determined by review of the relevant medical record and abstract ed without identifying patient information onto a st and ard form . All date s of death were confirmed by death certificates , and all causes of death were confirmed by review of death certificates and medical records . Follow-up was complete for all patients . End Points The primary end point was the first major bleeding event during the 6-month intervention period . Using explicit criteria in the Bleeding Severity Index ( 39 ) for the amount , rate , and consequences of bleeding , we defined major bleeding as overt bleeding that led to the loss of at least 2.0 units of blood in 7 days or less or was otherwise life-threatening ( for example , intracranial bleeding ) . Bleeding was classified without information about possible risk factors or r and omization status . Two author- review ers who were blinded to group assignment adjudicated bleeding events ; their agreement was high ( statistic , 0.97 ) . Secondary outcomes were death and recurrent venous thromboembolism at 6 months ; major bleeding after 6 months ; and control of anticoagulant therapy during the first 6 months of therapy , as measured by the INR . The therapeutic range of the INR was defined as 2.5 to 3.5 for persons with mechanical heart valves and 2.0 to 3.0 for persons with all other indications ( 40 ) . Therapeutic quality control was assessed by using the patient-time approach , described by Rosendaal and colleagues ( 41 ) , for three time periods after discharge from the hospital : 0 to 1 month , 1 to 3 months , and 3 to 6 months of therapy . This approach estimates the amount of time a patient is in the therapeutic range based on the actual INRs measured , assuming a linear relationship between consecutive INRs . Patients with only one\\\", \\\"An ageing population and the continuing expansion of clinical indications for coumadin therapy have increased pressure on hospital anticoagulant clinics . One solution is patient self\\u2010testing ( PST ) of the international normalized ratio ( INR ) using capillary blood sample s on point\\u2010of\\u2010care coagulation monitors at home . We conducted a prospect i ve study to determine whether patients can achieve accurate INR values through PST , using the CoaguChek S ( Roche Diagnostics , Lewes , UK ) . The main outcome measurements were : comparability of INR values obtained by PST and the hospital laboratory , patient acceptability as assessed by a question naire and anticoagulant control . Eighty\\u2010four patients [ 53 men , 31 women ; median age 59 years ( range 26\\u201383 ) ] , receiving long\\u2010term oral anticoagulation ( warfarin ) , were recruited from our Anticoagulation Clinic . Patients were r and omized to weekly self\\u2010testing or continuing 4\\u2010weekly hospital laboratory monitoring of INR . Comparison of INRs ( n = 234 ) showed no significant differences between the CoaguChek ( median INR 3\\u00b702 ) and laboratory testing ( median INR 3\\u00b707 ) . There was excellent correlation between the two methods ( r = 0\\u00b795 ) , with 85 % of CoaguChek results within 0\\u00b75 INR units of the laboratory method . On four occasions , differences of > 1 unit INR were obtained , but in each case the patient 's anticoagulation was unstable ( INR > 4\\u00b75 by both methods ) and the differences in INR would not have altered patient management . 87 % of patients found self\\u2010testing straightforward , 87 % were confident in the result they obtained and 77 % preferred self\\u2010testing . We conclude that PST is a reliable alternative to hospital clinic attendance and is acceptable to the majority of suitably trained patients\\\"]\",\n          \"['BACKGROUND Actinic keratosis is a common precursor to sun-related squamous-cell carcinoma . Treating actinic keratoses and the surrounding skin area ( i.e. , field therapy ) can eradicate clinical and sub clinical actinic keratoses . Topical field therapy currently requires weeks or months of treatment . We investigated the efficacy and safety of a new topical field therapy for actinic keratosis , ingenol mebutate gel ( 0.015 % for face and scalp and 0.05 % for trunk and extremities ) . METHODS In four multicenter , r and omized , double-blind studies , we r and omly assigned patients with actinic keratoses on the face or scalp or on the trunk or extremities to receive ingenol mebutate or placebo ( vehicle ) , self-applied to a 25-cm(2 ) contiguous field once daily for 3 consecutive days for lesions on the face or scalp or for 2 consecutive days for the trunk or extremities . Complete clearance ( primary outcome ) was assessed at 57 days , and local reactions were quantitatively measured . RESULTS In a pooled analysis of the two trials involving the face and scalp , the rate of complete clearance was higher with ingenol mebutate than with placebo ( 42.2 % vs. 3.7 % , P<0.001 ) . Local reactions peaked at day 4 , with a mean maximum composite score of 9.1 on the local-skin-response scale ( which ranges from 0 to 4 for six types of reaction , yielding a composite score of 0 to 24 , with higher numbers indicating more severe reactions ) , rapidly decreased by day 8 , and continued to decrease , approaching baseline scores by day 29 . In a pooled analysis of the two trials involving the trunk and extremities , the rate of complete clearance was also higher with ingenol mebutate than with placebo ( 34.1 % vs. 4.7 % , P<0.001 ) . Local skin reactions peaked between days 3 and 8 and declined rapidly , approaching baseline by day 29 , with a mean maximum score of 6.8 . Adverse events were generally mild to moderate in intensity and resolved without sequelae . CONCLUSIONS Ingenol mebutate gel applied topically for 2 to 3 days is effective for field treatment of actinic keratoses .

However , the duration of the benefit is unknown , as are the effects specific to age and sex . METHODS In the Minnesota Colon Cancer Control Study , 46,551 participants , 50 to 80 years of age , were r and omly assigned to usual care ( control ) or to annual or biennial screening with fecal occult-blood testing . Screening was performed from 1976 through 1982 and from 1986 through 1992 . We used the National Death Index to obtain up date d information on the vital status of participants and to determine causes of death through 2008 . RESULTS Through 30 years of follow-up , 33,020 participants ( 70.9 % ) died . A total of 732 deaths were attributed to colorectal cancer : 200 of the 11,072 deaths ( 1.8 % ) in the annual-screening group , 237 of the 11,004 deaths ( 2.2 % ) in the biennial-screening group , and 295 of the 10,944 deaths ( 2.7 % ) in the control group . Screening reduced colorectal-cancer mortality ( relative risk with annual screening , 0.68 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.56 to 0.82 ; relative risk with biennial screening , 0.78 ; 95 % CI , 0.65 to 0.93 ) through 30 years of follow-up . No reduction was observed in all-cause mortality ( relative risk with annual screening , 1.00 ; 95 % CI , 0.99 to 1.01 ; relative risk with biennial screening , 0.99 ; 95 % CI , 0.98 to 1.01 ) . The reduction in colorectal-cancer mortality was larger for men than for women in the biennial-screening group ( P=0.04 for interaction ) . CONCLUSIONS The effect of screening with fecal occult-blood testing on colorectal-cancer mortality persists after 30 years but does not influence all-cause mortality .

We assessed their effects on mortality and breastfeeding rates  in rural Malawi . METHODS We did a 2 \\u00d7 2 factorial , cluster-r and omised trial in 185,888 people in Mchinji district . 48 equal-sized clusters were r and omly allocated to four groups with a computer-generated number sequence . 24 facilitators guided groups through a community action cycle to tackle maternal and child health problems . 72 trained volunteer peer counsellors  made home visits at five timepoints during pregnancy and after birth to support breastfeeding and infant care . Primary outcomes for the women 's group intervention were maternal , perinatal , neonatal , and infant mortality rates ( MMR , PMR , NMR , and IMR , respectively ) ; and for the peer counselling were IMR and exclusive breastfeeding ( EBF ) rates . Analysis was by intention to treat . The trial is registered as IS RCT N06477126 . FINDINGS We monitored outcomes of 26,262 births between 2005 and 2009 . In a factorial model adjusted only for clustering and the volunteer peer counselling intervention , in women 's group areas , for years 2 and 3 , we noted non-significant decreases in NMR ( odds ratio 0.93 , 0.64 - 1.35 ) and MMR ( 0.54 , 0.28 - 1.04 ) . After adjustment for parity , socioeconomic quintile , and baseline measures , effects were larger for NMR ( 0.85 , 0.59 - 1.22 ) and MMR ( 0.48 , 0.26 - 0.91 ) . Because of the interaction between the two interventions , a stratified analysis was done . For women 's groups , in adjusted analyses , MMR fell by 74 % ( 0.26 , 0.10 - 0.70 ) , and NMR by 41 % ( 0.59 , 0.40 - 0.86 ) in areas with no peer counsellors , but there was no effect in areas with counsellors ( 1.09 , 0.40 - 2.98 , and 1.38 , 0.75 - 2.54 ) . Factorial analysis for the peer counselling intervention for years 1 - 3 showed a fall in IMR of 18 % ( 0.82 , 0.67 - 1.00 ) and an improvement in EBF rates ( 2.42 , 1.48 - 3.96 ) . The results of the stratified , adjusted analysis showed a 36 % reduction in IMR ( 0.64 , 0.48 - 0.85 ) but no effect on EBF ( 1.18 , 0.63 - 2.25 ) in areas without women 's groups , and in areas with women 's groups there was no effect on IMR ( 1.05 , 0.82 - 1.36 ) and an increase in EBF ( 5.02 , 2.67 - 9.44 ) . The cost of women 's groups was US$ 114 per year of life lost ( YLL ) averted and that of peer counsellors was $ 33 per YLL averted , using stratified data from single intervention comparisons .

FUNDING Saving Newborn Lives , UK Department for International Development , and Wellcome Trust\\\", 'BACKGROUND Venous thromboembolism is a common , potentially avoidable cause of death and morbidity in patients in hospital , including those with stroke . In surgical patients , intermittent pneumatic compression ( IPC ) reduces the risk of deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ) , but no reliable evidence exists about its effectiveness in patients who have had a stroke . We assessed the effectiveness of IPC to reduce the risk of DVT in patients who have had a stroke . METHODS The CLOTS 3 trial is a multicentre parallel group r and omised trial assessing IPC in immobile patients ( ie , who can not walk to the toilet without the help of another person ) with acute stroke . We enrolled patients from day 0 to day 3 of admission and allocated them via a central r and omisation system ( ratio 1:1 ) to receive either IPC or no IPC . A technician who was masked to treatment allocation did a compression duplex ultrasound ( CDU ) of both legs at 7 - 10 days and , wherever practical , at 25 - 30 days after enrolment . Caregivers and patients were not masked to treatment assignment . Patients were followed up for 6 months to determine survival and later symptomatic venous thromboembolism . The primary outcome was a DVT in the proximal veins detected on a screening CDU or any symptomatic DVT in the proximal veins , confirmed on imaging , within 30 days of r and omisation . Patients were analysed according to their treatment allocation . TRIAL REGISTRATION IS RCT N93529999 . FINDINGS Between Dec 8 , 2008 , and Sept 6 , 2012 , 2876 patients were enrolled in 94 centres in the UK . The included patients were broadly representative of immobile stroke patients admitted to hospital and had a median age of 76 years ( IQR 67 - 84 ) . The primary outcome occurred in 122 ( 8\\u00b75 % ) of 1438 patients allocated IPC and 174 ( 12\\u00b71 % ) of 1438 patients allocated no IPC ; an absolute reduction in risk of 3\\u00b76 % ( 95 % CI 1\\u00b74 - 5\\u00b78 ) . Excluding the 323 patients who died before any primary outcome and 41 without any screening CDU , the adjusted OR for the comparison of 122 of 1267 patients vs 174 of 1245 patients was 0\\u00b765 ( 95 % CI 0\\u00b751 - 0\\u00b784 ; p=0\\u00b7001 ) .

However , the timing for the initiation of ART during tuberculosis treatment remains unresolved . METHODS We conducted a three-group , open-label , r and omized , controlled trial in South Africa involving 642 ambulatory patients , all with tuberculosis ( confirmed by a positive sputum smear for acid-fast bacilli ) , human immunodeficiency virus infection , and a CD4 + T-cell count of less than 500 per cubic millimeter . Findings in the earlier-ART group ( ART initiated within 4 weeks after the start of tuberculosis treatment ,  214 patients ) and later-ART group ( ART initiated during the first 4 weeks of the continuation phase of tuberculosis treatment ,  215 patients ) are presented here . RESULTS At baseline , the median CD4 + T-cell count was 150 per cubic millimeter , and the median viral load was 161,000 copies per milliliter , with no significant differences between the two groups . The incidence rate of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) or death was 6.9 cases per 100 person-years in the earlier-ART group ( 18 cases ) as compared with 7.8 per 100 person-years in the later-ART group ( 19 cases ) ( incidence-rate ratio , 0.89 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.44 to 1.79 ; P=0.73 ) . However , among patients with CD4 + T-cell counts of less than 50 per cubic millimeter , the incidence rates of AIDS or death were 8.5 and 26.3 cases per 100 person-years , respectively ( incidence-rate ratio , 0.32 ; 95 % CI , 0.07 to 1.13 ; P=0.06 ) . The incidence rates of the immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome ( IRIS ) were 20.1 and 7.7 cases per 100 person-years , respectively ( incidence-rate ratio , 2.62 ; 95 % CI , 1.48 to 4.82 ; P<0.001 ) . Adverse events requiring a switching of antiretroviral drugs occurred in 10 patients in the earlier-ART group and 1 patient in the later-ART group ( P=0.006 ) . CONCLUSIONS Early initiation of ART in patients with CD4 + T-cell counts of less than 50 per cubic millimeter increased AIDS-free survival . Deferral of the initiation of ART to the first 4 weeks of the continuation phase of tuberculosis therapy in those with higher CD4 + T-cell counts reduced the risks of IRIS and other adverse events related to ART without increasing the risk of AIDS or death .

For faster and more reliable administration , paramedics increasingly use an intramuscular route . METHODS This double-blind , r and omized , noninferiority trial compared the efficacy of intramuscular midazolam with that of intravenous lorazepam for children and adults in status epilepticus treated by paramedics . Subjects whose convulsions had persisted for more than 5 minutes and who were still convulsing after paramedics arrived were given the study medication by either intramuscular autoinjector or intravenous infusion . The primary outcome was absence of seizures at the time of arrival in the emergency department without the need for rescue therapy . Secondary outcomes included endotracheal intubation , recurrent seizures , and timing of treatment relative to the cessation of convulsive seizures . This trial tested the hypothesis that intramuscular midazolam was noninferior to intravenous lorazepam by a margin of 10 percentage points . RESULTS At the time of arrival in the emergency department , seizures were absent without rescue therapy in 329 of 448 subjects ( 73.4 % ) in the intramuscular-midazolam group and in 282 of 445 ( 63.4 % ) in the intravenous-lorazepam group ( absolute difference , 10 percentage points ; 95 % confidence interval , 4.0 to 16.1 ; P<0.001 for both noninferiority and superiority ) . The two treatment groups were similar with respect to need for endotracheal intubation ( 14.1 % of subjects with intramuscular midazolam and 14.4 % with intravenous lorazepam ) and recurrence of seizures ( 11.4 % and 10.6 % , respectively ) . Among subjects whose seizures ceased before arrival in the emergency department , the median times to active treatment were 1.2 minutes in the intramuscular-midazolam group and 4.8 minutes in the intravenous-lorazepam group , with corresponding median times from active treatment to cessation of convulsions of 3.3 minutes and 1.6 minutes . Adverse-event rates were similar in the two groups . CONCLUSIONS For subjects in status epilepticus , intramuscular midazolam is at least as safe and effective as intravenous lorazepam for prehospital seizure cessation .

We r and omly assigned women with a multiple pregnancy between 12 and 20 weeks ' gestation ( 1:1 ) to pessary or control groups  , using a web-based application with a computer-generated list with r and om block sizes of two to four , stratified by hospital . Participants and investigators were aware of group allocation . For women in the pessary group , a midwife or obstetrician inserted a cervical pessary between 16 and 20 weeks ' gestation . Women in the control group did not receive the pessary , but otherwise received similar obstetrical care to those in the pessary group . The primary outcome was a composite of poor perinatal outcome : stillbirth , periventricular leucomalacia , severe respiratory distress syndrome , bronchopulmonary dysplasia , intraventricular haemorrhage , necrotising enterocolitis , proven sepsis , and neonatal death .

We assessed outcomes from the TRILOGY ACS trial based on whether or not patients had coronary angiography before treatment was chosen . METHODS TRILOGY ACS ( Clinical Trials.gov number NCT00699998 ) was a r and omised controlled trial , done at more than 800 sites worldwide . Patients with non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome who were selected for management without [ corrected ] revascularisation were r and omly assigned to clopidogrel or prasugrel . The primary endpoint was cardiovascular death , myocardial infa rct ion , or stroke at 30 months . In the present analysis we assessed differences in the primary endpoint by angiography status and whether the effects of treatment on the primary endpoint differed between patients who had angiography before enrolment and those who had not . FINDINGS 7243 patients younger than 75 years were included in the TRILOGY ACS primary analysis . 3085 ( 43 % ) had angiography at baseline , 4158 ( 57 % ) had not . Fewer patients who had angiography reached the primary endpoint at 30 months compared with those who did not have angiography , according to Kaplan-Meier analysis ( 281/3085 [ 12\\u00b78 % ] vs 480/4158 [ 16\\u00b75 % ] , adjusted hazard ratio [ HR ] 0\\u00b763 , 95 % CI 0\\u00b753 - 0\\u00b775 ; p<0\\u00b70001 ) . The proportion of patients who reached the primary endpoint was lower in the prasugrel group than in the clopidogrel group for those who had angiography ( 122/1524 [ 10\\u00b77 % ] vs 159/1561 [ 14\\u00b79 % ] , HR 0\\u00b777 , 95 % CI 0\\u00b761 - 0\\u00b798 ; p=0\\u00b7032 ) but did not differ between groups in patients who did not have angiography ( 242/2096 [ 16\\u00b73 % ] vs 238/2062 [ 16\\u00b77 % ] , HR 1\\u00b701 , 0\\u00b784 - 1\\u00b720 ; p=0\\u00b794 ; pinteraction=0\\u00b708 ) . Overall , TIMI major bleeding and GUSTO severe bleeding were rare . Bleeding outcomes tended to be higher with prasugrel but did not differ significantly between treatment groups in either angiography cohort . INTERPRETATION Among patients who had angiography who took prasugrel there were fewer cardiovascular deaths , myocardial infa rct ions , or strokes than in those who took clopidogrel . This result needs to be corroborated , but it is consistent with previous trials of more versus less intensive antiplatelet treatment . When angiography is done for acute coronary syndrome and anatomic coronary disease confirmed , the benefits and risks of intensive antiplatelet treatment exist whether the patient is treated with drugs or percutaneous coronary intervention .

After the failure of torcetrapib it was unknown if HDL produced by interaction with CETP had pro-atherogenic or pro-inflammatory properties . dal-PLAQUE is the first multicentre study using novel non-invasive multimodality imaging to assess structural and inflammatory indices of atherosclerosis as primary endpoints . METHODS In this phase 2b , double-blind , multicentre trial , patients ( aged 18 - 75 years ) with , or with high risk of , coronary heart disease were r and omly assigned ( 1:1 ) to dalcetrapib 600 mg/day or placebo for 24 months . R and omisation was done with a computer-generated r and omisation code and was stratified by centre . Patients and investigators were masked to treatment . Co primary endpoints were MRI-assessed indices ( total vessel area , wall area , wall thickness , and normalised wall index [ average carotid ] ) after 24 months and (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose ( (18)F-FDG ) PET/CT assessment of arterial inflammation within an index vessel ( right carotid , left carotid , or ascending thoracic aorta ) after 6 months , with no-harm boundaries established before unblinding of the trial .

METHODS We r and omly assigned patients with a Karnofsky performance-status score of 70 or more ( on a scale from 0 to 100 , with higher scores indicating better performance status ) to nab-paclitaxel ( 125 mg per square meter of body-surface area ) followed by gemcitabine  ( 1000 mg per square meter ) on days 1 , 8 , and 15 every 4 weeks or gemcitabine monotherapy ( 1000 mg per square meter ) weekly for 7 of 8 weeks ( cycle 1 ) and then on days 1 , 8 , and 15 every 4 weeks ( cycle 2 and subsequent cycles ) . Patients received the study treatment until disease progression . The primary end point was overall survival ; secondary end points were progression-free survival and overall response rate . RESULTS A total of 861 patients were r and omly assigned to nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine ( 431 patients ) or gemcitabine  ( 430 ) . The median overall survival was 8.5 months in the nab-paclitaxel-gemcitabine group as compared with 6.7 months in the gemcitabine group ( hazard ratio for death , 0.72 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.62 to 0.83 ; P<0.001 ) . The survival rate was 35 % in the nab-paclitaxel-gemcitabine group versus 22 % in the gemcitabine group at 1 year , and 9 % versus 4 % at 2 years . The median progression-free survival was 5.5 months in the nab-paclitaxel-gemcitabine group , as compared with 3.7 months in the gemcitabine group ( hazard ratio for disease progression or death , 0.69 ; 95 % CI , 0.58 to 0.82 ; P<0.001 ) ; the response rate according to independent review was 23 % versus 7 % in the two groups ( P<0.001 ) . The most common adverse events of grade 3 or higher were neutropenia ( 38 % in the nab-paclitaxel-gemcitabine group vs. 27 % in the gemcitabine group ) , fatigue ( 17 % vs. 7 % ) , and neuropathy ( 17 % vs. 1 % ) . Febrile neutropenia occurred in 3 % versus 1 % of the patients in the two groups .

Although well studied in other fields , balanced enrollment of patients with relevant demographic characteristics in vascular surgery r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) is not well known . This study describes the reporting of gender and ethnicity data in vascular surgery RCTs and analyzes whether these studies adequately represent our diverse patient population . METHODS We conducted a retrospective review of United States-based RCTs from 1983 through 2007 for three broadly defined vascular procedures : aortic aneurysm repair ( AAR ) , carotid revascularization ( CR ) , and lower extremity revascularization ( LER ) . Included studies were examined for gender and ethnicity data , study parameters , funding source , and geographic region . The Nationwide Inpatient Sample ( NIS ) data base was analyzed to obtain group-specific procedure frequency as an estimate of procedure frequency in the general population . RESULTS We review ed 77 studies , and 52 met our inclusion criteria . Only 85 % reported gender , and 21 % reported ethnicity . Reporting of ethnicity was strongly associated with larger ( > 280 participants ) , multicenter , government-funded trials ( P < .001 for all ) . Women are disproportionately under-represented in RCTs for all procedure categories ( AAR , 9.0 % vs 21.5 % ; CR , 30.0 % vs 42.9 % ; LER , 22.4 % vs 41.3 % ) . Minorities are under-represented in AAR studies ( 6.0 % vs 10.7 % ) and CR studies ( 6.9 % vs 9.5 % ) but are over-represented in LER studies ( 26.0 % vs 21.8 % , P < .001 for all ) . CONCLUSIONS Minority ethnicity and female gender are under-reported and under-represented in vascular surgery RCTs , particularly in small , non-government-funded and single-center trials . The generalizability of some trial results may not be applicable to these population s. Greater effort to enroll a balanced study population in RCTs may yield more broadly applicable results', 'BACKGROUND Arthroscopic partial meniscectomy is one of the most common orthopedic procedures , yet rigorous evidence of its efficacy is lacking . METHODS We conducted a multicenter , r and omized , double-blind , sham-controlled trial in 146 patients 35 to 65 years of age who had knee symptoms consistent with a degenerative medial meniscus tear and no knee osteoarthritis . Patients were r and omly assigned to arthroscopic partial meniscectomy or sham surgery . The primary outcomes were changes in the Lysholm and Western Ontario Meniscal Evaluation Tool ( WOMET ) scores ( each ranging from 0 to 100 , with lower scores indicating more severe symptoms ) and in knee pain after exercise ( rated on a scale from 0 to 10 , with 0 denoting no pain ) at 12 months after the procedure . RESULTS In the intention-to-treat analysis , there were no significant between-group differences in the change from baseline to 12 months in any primary outcome . The mean changes ( improvements ) in the primary outcome measures were as follows : Lysholm score , 21.7 points in the partial-meniscectomy group as compared with 23.3 points in the sham-surgery group ( between-group difference , -1.6 points ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , -7.2 to 4.0 ) ; WOMET score , 24.6 and 27.1 points , respectively ( between-group difference , -2.5 points ; 95 % CI , -9.2 to 4.1 ) ; and score for knee pain after exercise , 3.1 and 3.3 points , respectively ( between-group difference , -0.1 ; 95 % CI , -0.9 to 0.7 ) . There were no significant differences between groups in the number of patients who required subsequent knee surgery ( two in the partial-meniscectomy group and five in the sham-surgery group ) or serious adverse events ( one and zero , respectively ) . CONCLUSIONS In this trial involving patients without knee osteoarthritis but with symptoms of a degenerative medial meniscus tear , the outcomes after arthroscopic partial meniscectomy were no better than those after a sham surgical procedure .

Study participants and clinical assessors were masked to drug allocation . Allocation to continuous or discontinuous treatment was masked up to 3 months , at which point investigators and participants were unmasked . The primary outcome was BCVA at 2 years , with a prespecified non-inferiority limit of 3\\u00b75 letters . The primary safety outcome was arterial thrombotic event or hospital admission for heart failure . Analyses were by modified intention to treat . This trial is registered , number IS RCT N92166560 . FINDINGS Between March 27 , 2008 , and Oct 15 , 2010 , 628 patients underwent r and omisation . 18 were withdrawn ; 610 received study drugs ( 314 ranibizumab ; 296 bevacizumab ) and were included in analyses . 525 participants reached the visit at 2 years : 134 ranibizumab in continuous regimen , 137 ranibizumab in discontinuous regimen , 127 bevacizumab in continuous regimen , and 127 bevacizumab in discontinuous regimen . For BCVA , bevacizumab was neither non-inferior nor inferior to ranibizumab ( mean difference -1\\u00b737 letters , 95 % CI -3\\u00b775 to 1\\u00b701 ; p=0\\u00b726 ) . Discontinuous treatment was neither non-inferior nor inferior to continuous treatment ( -1\\u00b763 letters , -4\\u00b701 to 0\\u00b775 ; p=0\\u00b718 ) . Frequency of arterial thrombotic events or hospital admission for heart failure did not differ between groups given ranibizumab ( 20 [ 6 % ] of 314 participants ) and bevacizumab ( 12 [ 4 % ] of 296 ; odds ratio [ OR ] 1\\u00b769 , 95 % CI 0\\u00b780 - 3\\u00b757 ; p=0\\u00b716 ) , or those given continuous ( 12 [ 4 % ] of 308 ) and discontinuous treatment ( 20 [ 7 % ] of 302 ; 0\\u00b756 , 0\\u00b727 - 1\\u00b719 ; p=0\\u00b713 ) . Mortality was lower with continuous than discontinuous treatment ( OR 0\\u00b747 , 95 % CI 0\\u00b722 - 1\\u00b703 ; p=0\\u00b705 ) , but did not differ by drug group ( 0\\u00b796 , 0\\u00b746 - 2\\u00b702 ; p=0\\u00b791 ) . INTERPRETATION Ranibizumab and bevacizumab have similar efficacy . Reduction in the frequency of retreatment result ed in a small loss of efficacy irrespective of drug . Safety was worse when treatment was administered discontinuously . These findings highlight that the choice of anti-VEGF treatment strategy is less straightforward than previously thought .

Other activating RAS mutations may also be negative predictive biomarkers for anti-EGFR therapy . METHODS In this prospect ive-retrospective analysis , we assessed the efficacy and safety of panitumumab plus oxaliplatin , fluorouracil , and leucovorin ( FOLFOX4 ) as compared with FOLFOX4 alone , according to RAS ( KRAS or NRAS ) or BRAF mutation status . A total of 639 patients who had metastatic colorectal cancer without KRAS mutations in exon 2 had results for at least one of the following : KRAS exon 3 or 4 ; NRAS exon 2 , 3 , or 4 ; or BRAF exon 15 . The overall rate of ascertainment of RAS status was 90 % . RESULTS Among 512 patients without RAS mutations , progression-free survival was 10.1 months with panitumumab-FOLFOX4 versus 7.9 months with FOLFOX4 alone ( hazard ratio for progression or death with combination therapy , 0.72 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.58 to 0.90 ; P=0.004 ) . Overall survival was 26.0 months in the panitumumab-FOLFOX4 group versus 20.2 months in the FOLFOX4-alone group ( hazard ratio for death , 0.78 ; 95 % CI , 0.62 to 0.99 ; P=0.04 ) . A total of 108 patients ( 17 % ) with nonmutated KRAS exon 2 had other RAS mutations . These mutations were associated with inferior progression-free survival and overall survival with panitumumab-FOLFOX4 treatment , which was consistent with the findings in patients with KRAS mutations in exon 2 .  BRAF mutations were a negative prognostic factor . No new safety signals were identified . CONCLUSIONS Additional RAS mutations predicted a lack of response in patients who received panitumumab-FOLFOX4 . In patients who had metastatic colorectal cancer without RAS mutations , improvements in overall survival were observed with panitumumab-FOLFOX4 therapy .

The primary endpoint was first cardiovascular event , including cardiovascular mortality and morbidity , revascularisation , and non-traumatic amputation within 5 years . Patients and staff assessing outcomes were unaware of the practice 's study group assignment . Analysis was done by intention to treat . This study is registered with Clinical Trials.gov , number NCT00237549 . Findings Primary endpoint data were available for 3055 ( 99\\u00b79 % ) of 3057 screen-detected patients .

METHODS In this multicenter trial , we r and omly assigned patients 40 to 74 years of age with symptoms suggestive of acute coronary syndromes but without ischemic electrocardiographic changes or an initial positive troponin test to early CCTA or to st and ard evaluation in the emergency department on weekdays during daylight hours between April 2010 and January 2012 . The primary end point was length of stay in the hospital . Secondary end points included rates of discharge from the emergency department , major adverse cardiovascular events at 28 days , and cumulative costs . Safety end points were undetected acute coronary syndromes . RESULTS The rate of acute coronary syndromes  among 1000 patients with a mean ( \\u00b1SD ) age of 54\\u00b18 years ( 47 % women ) was 8 % . After early CCTA , as compared with st and ard evaluation  , the mean length of stay in the hospital was reduced by 7.6 hours ( P<0.001 ) and more patients were discharged directly from the emergency department ( 47 % vs. 12 % , P<0.001 ) . There were no undetected acute coronary syndromes and no significant differences in major adverse cardiovascular events at 28 days . After CCTA , there was more downstream testing and higher radiation exposure . The cumulative mean cost of care was similar in the CCTA group and the st and ard-evaluation group ( $ 4,289 and $ 4,060 , respectively ; P=0.65 ) . CONCLUSIONS In patients in the emergency department with symptoms suggestive of acute coronary syndromes , incorporating CCTA into a triage strategy improved the efficiency of clinical decision making , as compared with a st and ard evaluation in the emergency department , but it result ed in an increase in downstream testing and radiation exposure with no decrease in the overall costs of care .

Participants were r and omly allocated 1:1:1 with a remote computer allocation to receive a silver alloy-coated catheter , a nitrofural-impregnated catheter , or a PTFE-coated catheter ( control group ) . Patients undergoing unplanned catheterisation were also included and consent for participation was obtained retrospectively . Participants and trial staff were unmasked to treatment assignment . Data were collected by trial staff and by patient-reported question naires for 6 weeks after r and omisation . The primary outcome was incidence of symptomatic urinary tract infection for which an antibiotic was prescribed by 6 weeks . We postulated that a 3\\u00b73 % absolute reduction in CAUTI would represent sufficient benefit to recommend routine use of antimicrobial catheters .

We aim ed to compare the effect of annual versus twice-yearly distribution of azithromycin on infection with these strains . METHODS We did a cluster-r and omised trial in 24 subdistricts in northern Ethiopia , which we r and omly assigned to receive annual or twice-yearly treatment for all residents of all ages . R and om assignment was done with the R AND OM and SORT functions of Microsoft Excel . All individuals were offered their assigned treatment of a single , directly observed , oral dose of azithromycin . A 6 week course of topical 1 % tetracycline ointment , applied twice daily to both eyes but not directly observed , was offered as an alternative to azithromycin in patients younger than 12 months , and in patients with self-reported pregnancy , with allergy , or who refused azithromycin .  Our primary , prespecified outcome was the prevalence of ocular chlamydial infection in a r and om sample of children aged 0 - 9 years at baseline and every 6 months for a total of 42 months within sentinel villages . Our analysis was by intention to treat . This study is registered with Clinical Trials.gov , number NCT00322972 . FINDINGS Antibiotic coverage of children aged 1 - 9 years was greater than 80 % ( range 80\\u00b79 to 93\\u00b70 ) at all study visits . In the groups treated annually , the prevalence of infection in children aged 0 - 9 years was reduced from a mean 41\\u00b79 % ( 95 % CI 31\\u00b75 to 52\\u00b72 ) at baseline to 1\\u00b79 % ( 0\\u00b73 to 3\\u00b75 ) at 42 months .

Despite two r and omized trials that did not show a benefit of renal-artery stenting with respect to kidney function , the usefulness of stenting for the prevention of major adverse renal and cardiovascular events is uncertain . METHODS We r and omly assigned 947 participants who had atherosclerotic renal-artery stenosis and either systolic hypertension while taking two or more antihypertensive drugs or chronic kidney disease to medical therapy plus renal-artery stenting or medical therapy alone . Participants were followed for the occurrence of adverse cardiovascular and renal events ( a composite end point of death from cardiovascular or renal causes , myocardial infa rct ion , stroke , hospitalization for congestive heart failure , progressive renal insufficiency , or the need for renal-replacement therapy ) . RESULTS Over a median follow-up period of 43 months ( interquartile range , 31 to 55 ) , the rate of the primary composite end point did not differ significantly between participants who underwent stenting in addition to receiving medical therapy and those who received medical therapy alone ( 35.1 % and 35.8 % , respectively ; hazard ratio with stenting , 0.94 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.76 to 1.17 ; P=0.58 ) . There were also no significant differences between the treatment groups in the rates of the individual components of the primary end point or in all-cause mortality . During follow-up , there was a consistent modest difference in systolic blood pressure favoring the stent group ( -2.3 mm Hg ; 95 % CI , -4.4 to -0.2 ; P=0.03 ) . CONCLUSIONS Renal-artery stenting did not confer a significant benefit with respect to the prevention of clinical events when added to comprehensive , multifactorial medical therapy in people with atherosclerotic renal-artery stenosis and hypertension or chronic kidney disease .

A baseline survey identified 256 clusters , which were r and omly assigned ( within urban and rural strata , by computer-generated r and om numbers ) to one of three groups : non-supplemented control ( group A ) , micronutrient powder without zinc ( group B ) , or micronutrient powder with 10 mg zinc ( group C ) . Children in the clusters aged 6 months were eligible for inclusion in the study . Powders were to be given daily between 6 and 18 months of age ; follow-up was to age 2 years . Micronutrient powder sachets for groups B and C were identical except for colour ; investigators and field and supervisory staff were masked to composition of the micronutrient powders until trial completion . Parents knew whether their child was receiving supplementation , but did not know whether the powder contained zinc . Primary outcomes were growth , episodes of diarrhoea , acute lower respiratory tract infection , fever , and incidence of admission to hospital . This trial is registered with Clinical Trials.gov , number NCT00705445 . RESULTS The trial was done between Nov 1 , 2008 , and Dec 31 , 2011 . 947 children were enrolled in group A clusters , 910 in group B clusters , and 889 in group C clusters . Micronutrient powder administration was associated with lower risk of iron-deficiency anaemia at 18 months compared with the control group ( odds ratio [ OR ] for micronutrient powder without zinc=0\\u00b720 , 95 % CI 0\\u00b711 - 0\\u00b736 ; OR for micronutrient powder with zinc=0\\u00b725 , 95 % CI 0\\u00b714 - 0\\u00b744 ) .

We recorded strong evidence of an increased proportion of days with diarrhoea ( p=0\\u00b7001 ) and increased incidence of bloody diarrhoea ( p=0\\u00b7003 ) between 6 and 18 months in the two micronutrient powder groups , and reported chest indrawing ( p=0\\u00b703 ) . Incidence of febrile episodes or admission to hospital for diarrhoea , respiratory problems , or febrile episodes did not differ between the three groups . INTERPRETATION Use of micronutrient powders reduces iron-deficiency anaemia in young children . However , the excess burden of diarrhoea and respiratory morbidities associated with micronutrient powder use and the very small effect on growth recorded suggest that a careful assessment of risks and benefits must be done in population s with malnourished children and high diarrhoea burdens .

METHODS At 29 centers in the United Kingdom , we conducted a r and omized noninferiority trial comparing low-dose and high-dose radioiodine , each in combination with either thyrotropin alfa or thyroid hormone withdrawal before ablation .  Patients ( age range , 16 to 80 years ) had tumor stage T1 to T3 , with possible spread to nearby lymph nodes but without metastasis . End points were the rate of success of ablation at 6 to 9 months , adverse events , quality of life , and length of hospital stay . RESULTS A total of 438 patients underwent r and omization ; data could be analyzed for 421 .  Ablation success rates were 85.0 % in the group receiving low-dose radioiodine versus 88.9 % in the group receiving the high dose and 87.1 % in the thyrotropin alfa group versus 86.7 % in the group undergoing thyroid hormone withdrawal . All 95 % confidence intervals for the differences were within \\u00b110 percentage points , indicating noninferiority . Similar results were found for low-dose radioiodine plus thyrotropin alfa ( 84.3 % ) versus high-dose radioiodine plus thyroid hormone withdrawal ( 87.6 % ) or high-dose radioiodine plus thyrotropin alfa ( 90.2 % ) . More patients in the high-dose group than in the low-dose group were hospitalized for at least 3 days ( 36.3 % vs. 13.0 % , P<0.001 ) .

We used a novel point-of-care genetic test to identify carriers of the CYP2C19 * 2 allele and aim ed to assess a pharmacogenetic approach to dual antiplatelet treatment after PCI . METHODS Between Aug 26 , 2010 , and July 7 , 2011 , 200 patients were enrolled into our prospect i ve , r and omised , proof-of-concept study . Patients undergoing PCI for acute coronary syndrome or stable angina were r and omly assigned to rapid point-of-care genotyping or to st and ard treatment . Individuals in the rapid genotyping group were screened for the CYP2C19 * 2 allele . Carriers were given 10 mg prasugrel daily , and non-carriers and patients in the st and ard treatment group were given 75 mg clopidogrel daily . The primary endpoint was the proportion of CYP2C19 * 2 carriers with high on-treatment platelet reactivity ( P2Y12 reactivity unit [ PRU ] value of more than 234 ) after 1 week of dual antiplatelet treatment , which is a marker associated with increased adverse cardiovascular events .

Here , we report the results of a triple-blind , placebo-controlled trial to compare the survival of fat grafts enriched with autologous adipose-derived stem cells ( ASCs ) versus non-enriched fat grafts . METHODS Healthy participants underwent two liposuctions  taken 14 days apart : one for ASC isolation and ex-vivo expansion , and another for the preparation of fat grafts . Two purified fat grafts ( 30 mL each ) taken from the second liposuction were prepared for each participant . One graft was enriched with ASCs ( 20 \\u00d7 10(6 ) cells per mL fat ) , and another graft without ASC enrichment served as a control . The fat grafts were injected subcutaneously as a bolus to the posterior part of the right and left upper arm according to the r and omisation sequence . The volumes of injected fat grafts were measured by MRI immediately after injection and after 121 days before surgical removal . The primary goal was to compare the residual graft volumes of ASC-enriched grafts with those of control grafts . This study is registered at www . clinical trialsregister.eu , number 2010 - 023006 - 12 . FINDINGS 13 participants were enrolled , three of whom were excluded . Compared with the control grafts , the ASC-enriched fat grafts had significantly higher residual volumes : 23\\u00b700 ( 95 % CI 20\\u00b757 - 25\\u00b743 ) cm(3 ) versus 4\\u00b766 ( 3\\u00b716 - 6\\u00b716 ) cm(3 ) for the controls , corresponding to 80\\u00b79 % ( 76\\u00b76 - 85\\u00b72 ) versus 16\\u00b73 % ( 11\\u00b71 - 21\\u00b74 ) of the initial volumes , respectively ( p<0\\u00b70001 ) . The difference between the groups was 18\\u00b734 ( 95 % CI 15\\u00b770 - 20\\u00b798 ) cm(3 ) , equivalent to 64\\u00b76 % ( 57\\u00b71 - 72\\u00b71 ; p<0\\u00b70001 ) . No serious adverse events were noted . INTERPRETATION The procedure of ASC-enriched fat grafting  had excellent feasibility and safety . These promising results add significantly to the prospect of stem cell use in clinical setting s , and indicate that ASC graft enrichment could render lipofilling a reliable alternative to major tissue augmentation , such as breast surgery , with allogeneic material or major flap surgery .

METHODS In our 3 year , r and omised , double-blind , placebo-controlled study , undertaken at 65 academic medical centres or outpatient clinics in North America , we enrolled men aged 48 - 82 years who had low-volume , Gleason score 5 - 6 prostate cancer and had chosen to be followed up with active surveillance . We r and omly allocated participants in a one-to-one ratio , stratified by site and in block sizes of four , to receive once-daily dutasteride 0\\u00b75 mg or matching placebo . Participants were followed up for 3 years , with 12-core prostate biopsy sample s obtained after 18 months and 3 years . The primary endpoint was time to prostate cancer progression , defined as the number of days between the start of study treatment and the earlier of either pathological progression ( in patients with \\u22651 biopsy assessment after baseline ) or therapeutic progression ( start of medical therapy ) . This trial is registered with Clinical Trials.gov , number NCT00363311 . FINDINGS Between Aug 10 , 2006 , and March 26 , 2007 , we r and omly allocated 302 participants , of whom 289 ( 96 % ) had at least one biopsy procedure after baseline and were included in the primary analysis . By 3 years , 54 ( 38 % ) of 144 men in the dutasteride group and 70 ( 48 % ) of 145 controls had prostate cancer progression ( pathological or therapeutic ; hazard ratio 0\\u00b762 , 95 % CI 0\\u00b743 - 0\\u00b789 ; p=0\\u00b7009 ) . Incidence of adverse events was much the same between treatment groups . 35 ( 24 % ) men in the dutasteride group and 23 ( 15 % ) controls had sexual adverse events or breast enlargement or tenderness . Eight ( 5 % ) men in the dutasteride group and seven ( 5 % ) controls had cardiovascular adverse events , but there were no prostate cancer-related deaths or instances of metastatic disease . INTERPRETATION Dutasteride could provide a beneficial adjunct to active surveillance for men with low-risk prostate cancer . FUNDING GlaxoSmithKline', 'BACKGROUND Dolutegravir ( S/GSK1349572 ) , a once-daily , unboosted integrase inhibitor , was recently approved in the United States for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) infection in combination with other antiretroviral agents . Dolutegravir , in combination with abacavir-lamivudine , may provide a simplified regimen . METHODS We conducted a r and omized , double-blind , phase 3 study involving adult participants who had not received previous therapy for HIV-1 infection and who had an HIV-1 RNA level of 1000 copies per milliliter or more . Participants were r and omly assigned to dolutegravir at a dose of 50 mg plus abacavir-lamivudine once daily ( DTG-ABC-3TC group ) or combination therapy with efavirenz-tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (DF)-emtricitabine once daily ( EFV-TDF-FTC group ) . The primary end point was the proportion of participants with an HIV-1 RNA level of less than 50 copies per milliliter at week 48 . Secondary end points included the time to viral suppression , the change from baseline in CD4 + T-cell count , safety , and viral resistance . RESULTS A total of 833 participants received at least one dose of study drug . At week 48 , the proportion of participants with an HIV-1 RNA level of less than 50 copies per milliliter was significantly higher in the DTG-ABC-3TC group than in the EFV-TDF-FTC group ( 88 % vs. 81 % , P=0.003 ) , thus meeting the criterion for superiority . The DTG-ABC-3TC group had a shorter median time to viral suppression than did the EFV-TDF-FTC group ( 28 vs. 84 days , P<0.001 ) , as well as greater increases in CD4 + T-cell count ( 267 vs. 208 per cubic millimeter , P<0.001 ) . The proportion of participants who discontinued therapy owing to adverse events was lower in the DTG-ABC-3TC group than in the EFV-TDF-FTC group ( 2 % vs. 10 % ) ; rash and neuropsychiatric events ( including abnormal dreams , anxiety , dizziness , and somnolence ) were significantly more common in the EFV-TDF-FTC group , whereas insomnia was reported more frequently in the DTG-ABC-3TC group . No participants in the DTG-ABC-3TC group had detectable antiviral resistance ; one tenofovir DF-associated mutation and four efavirenz-associated mutations were detected in participants with virologic failure in the EFV-TDF-FTC group . CONCLUSIONS Dolutegravir plus abacavir-lamivudine had a better safety profile and was more effective through 48 weeks than the regimen with efavirenz-tenofovir DF-emtricitabine .

The objective of this study is to determine the current level of compliance with these guidelines for the inclusion , analysis , and reporting of sex and race/ethnicity in federally funded r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) and to compare the current level of compliance with that from 2004 , which was reported previously . METHODS  RCTs published in nine prominent medical journals in 2009 were identified by PubMed search . Studies where individuals were not the unit of analysis , those begun before 1994 , and those not receiving federal funding were excluded . PubMed search located 512 published articles . After exclusion of ineligible articles , 86 ( 17 % ) remained for analysis . RESULTS Thirty studies were sex specific . The  median enrollment of women in the 56 studies that included both men and women was 37 % . Seventy-five percent of the studies did not report any outcomes by sex , including 9 studies reporting < 20 % women enrolled . Among all 86 studies , 21 % did not report sample sizes by racial and ethnic groups , and 64 % did not provide any analysis by racial or ethnic groups . Only 3 studies indicated that the generalizability of their results may be limited by lack of diversity among those studied . There were no statistically significant changes in inclusion or reporting of sex or race/ethnicity when compared with 2004 .

METHODS We carried out a 36-month , r and omized , double-blind , double-dummy , phase 3 study comparing oral mycophenolate mofetil ( 2 g per day ) and oral azathioprine ( 2 mg per kilogram of body weight per day ) , plus placebo in each group , in patients who met response criteria during a 6-month induction trial . The study group underwent repeat r and omization in a 1:1 ratio . Up to 10 mg of prednisone per day or its equivalent was permitted . The primary efficacy end point was the time to treatment failure , which was defined as death , end-stage renal disease , doubling of the serum creatinine level , renal flare , or rescue therapy for lupus nephritis . Secondary assessment s included the time to the individual components of treatment failure and adverse events . RESULTS A total of 227 patients were r and omly assigned to maintenance treatment ( 116 to mycophenolate mofetil and 111 to azathioprine ) . Mycophenolate mofetil was superior to azathioprine with respect to the primary end point , time to treatment failure ( hazard ratio , 0.44 ; 95 % confidence interval , 0.25 to 0.77 ; P = 0.003 ) , and with respect to time to renal flare and time to rescue therapy ( hazard ratio , < 1.00 ; P < 0.05 ) . Observed rates of treatment failure were 16.4 % ( 19 of 116 patients ) in the mycophenolate mofetil group and 32.4 % ( 36 of 111 ) in the azathioprine group . Adverse events , most commonly minor infections and gastrointestinal disorders , occurred in more than 95 % of the patients in both groups ( P = 0.68 ) . Serious adverse events occurred in 33.3 % of patients in the azathioprine group and in 23.5 % of those in the mycophenolate mofetil group ( P = 0.11 ) , and the rate of withdrawal due to adverse events was higher with azathioprine than with mycophenolate mofetil ( 39.6 % vs. 25.2 % , P = 0.02 ) . CONCLUSIONS Mycophenolate mofetil was superior to azathioprine in maintaining a renal response to treatment and in preventing relapse in patients with lupus nephritis who had a response to induction therapy .

METHODS In an unmasked , cluster-r and omised , two-period crossover trial , ten paediatric intensive-care units at five hospitals in the USA were r and omly assigned a  daily bathing routine for admitted patients older than 2 months , either st and ard bathing practice s or using a cloth impregnated with 2 % CHG , for a 6-month period . Units switched to the alternative bathing method for a second 6-month period . 6482 admissions were screened for eligibility . The primary outcome was an episode of bacteraemia . We did intention-to-treat ( ITT ) and per- protocol ( PP ) analyses . This study is registered with Clinical Trials.gov ( identifier NCT00549393 ) . FINDINGS 1521 admitted patients were excluded because their length of stay was less than 2 days , and 14 refused to participate . 4947 admissions were eligible for analysis . In the ITT population , a non-significant reduction in incidence of bacteraemia was noted with CHG bathing ( 3\\u00b752 per 1000 days , 95 % CI 2\\u00b764 - 4\\u00b761 ) compared with st and ard practice s ( 4\\u00b793 per 1000 days , 3\\u00b791 - 6\\u00b715 ; adjusted incidence rate ratio [ aIRR ] 0\\u00b771 , 95 % CI 0\\u00b742 - 1\\u00b720 ) .

FUNDING Sage Products , US National Institutes of Health', \\\"BACKGROUND Stroke is common during the first few weeks after a transient ischemic attack ( TIA ) or minor ischemic stroke .  Combination therapy with clopidogrel and aspirin may provide greater protection against subsequent stroke than aspirin alone . METHODS In a r and omized , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial conducted at 114 centers in China , we r and omly assigned 5170 patients within 24 hours after the onset of minor ischemic stroke or high-risk TIA to combination therapy with clopidogrel and aspirin ( clopidogrel at an initial dose of 300 mg , followed by 75 mg per day for 90 days , plus aspirin at a dose of 75 mg per day for the first 21 days ) or to placebo plus aspirin ( 75 mg per day for 90 days ) . All participants received open-label aspirin at a clinician-determined dose of 75 to 300 mg on day 1 . The primary outcome was stroke ( ischemic or hemorrhagic ) during 90 days of follow-up in an intention-to-treat analysis . Treatment differences were assessed with the use of a Cox proportional-hazards model , with study center as a r and om effect . RESULTS Stroke occurred in 8.2 % of patients in the clopidogrel-aspirin group , as compared with 11.7 % of those in the aspirin group ( hazard ratio , 0.68 ; 95 % confidence interval , 0.57 to 0.81 ; P<0.001 ) . Moderate or severe hemorrhage occurred in seven patients ( 0.3 % ) in the clopidogrel-aspirin group and in eight ( 0.3 % ) in the aspirin group ( P=0.73 ) ; the rate of hemorrhagic stroke was 0.3 % in each group . CONCLUSIONS Among patients with TIA or minor stroke who can be treated within 24 hours after the onset of symptoms , the combination of clopidogrel and aspirin is superior to aspirin alone for reducing the risk of stroke in the first 90 days and does not increase the risk of hemorrhage .

We investigated the effectiveness of tofacitinib ( CP-690,550 ) , a novel oral Janus kinase inhibitor , as a targeted immunomodulator and disease-modifying therapy for rheumatoid arthritis . METHODS We did a 6-month , double-blind , parallel-group phase 3 study at 82 centres in 13 countries , including North America , Europe , and Latin America . 399 patients aged 18 years or older with moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis and inadequate response to tumour necrosis factor inhibitors ( TNFi ) were r and omly assigned in a 2:2:1:1 ratio with an automated internet or telephone system to receive twice a day treatment with : tofacitinib 5 mg ( n=133 ) ; tofacitinib 10 mg ( n=134 ) ; or placebo ( n=132 ) , all with methotrexate . At month 3 , patients given placebo advanced to either tofacitinib 5 mg twice a day ( n=66 ) or 10 mg twice a day ( n=66 ) . Primary endpoints included American College of Rheumatology (ACR)20 response rate , mean change from baseline in Health Assessment Question naire-Disability Index ( HAQ-DI ) , and rates of disease activity score (DAS)28 - 4(ESR ) less than 2\\u00b76 ( referred to as DAS28<2\\u00b76 ) , all at month 3 . The full analysis set for the primary analysis included all r and omised patients who received at least one dose of study medication and had at least one post-baseline assessment .

Safety was consistent with phase 2 and 3 studies . The most common adverse events in months 0 - 3 were diarrhoea ( 13 of 267 ; 4\\u00b79 % ) , nasopharyngitis ( 11 of 267 ; 4\\u00b71 % ) , headache ( 11 of 267 ; 4\\u00b71 % ) , and urinary tract infection ( eight of 267 ; 3\\u00b70 % ) across tofacitinib groups , and nausea ( nine of 132 ; 6\\u00b78 % ) in the placebo group . INTERPRETATION In this treatment-refractory population  , tofacitinib with methotrexate had rapid and clinical ly meaningful improvements in signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis and physical function over 6 months with manageable safety . Tofacitinib could provide an effective treatment option in patients with an inadequate response to TNFi . FUNDING Pfizer', 'BACKGROUND Interim results from the children with HIV early antiretroviral ( CHER ) trial showed that early antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) was life-saving for infants infected with HIV . In view of the few treatment options and the potential toxicity associated with lifelong ART , in the CHER trial we compared early time-limited ART with deferred ART . METHODS CHER was an open-label r and omised controlled trial of HIV-infected asymptomatic infants younger than 12 weeks in two South African trial sites with a percentage of CD4-positive T lymphocytes ( CD4 % ) of 25 % or higher . 377 infants were r and omly allocated to one of three groups : deferred ART ( ART-Def ) , immediate ART for 40 weeks ( ART-40W ) , or immediate ART for 96 weeks ( ART-96W ) , with subsequent treatment interruption . The r and omisation schedule was stratified by clinical site with permuted blocks of r and om sizes to balance the numbers of infants allocated to each group . Criteria for ART initiation in the ART-Def group and re-initiation after interruption in the other groups were CD4 % less than 25 % in infancy ; otherwise , the criteria were CD4 % less than 20 % or Centers for Disease Control and Prevention severe stage B or stage C disease . Combination therapy of lopinavir-ritonavir , zidovudine , and lamivudine was the first-line treatment regimen at ART initiation and re-initiation . The primary endpoint was time to failure of first-line ART ( immunological , clinical , or virological ) or death . Comparisons were done by intention-to-treat analysis , with use of time-to-event methods . This trial is registered with Clinical Trials.gov , number NCT00102960 . FINDINGS 377 infants were enrolled , with a median age of 7\\u00b74 weeks , CD4 % of 35 % , and HIV RNA log 5\\u00b77 copies per mL. Median follow-up was 4\\u00b78 years ; 34 infants ( 9 % ) were lost to follow-up . Median time to ART initiation in the ART-Def group was 20 weeks ( IQR 16 - 25 ) . Time to restarting of ART after interruption was 33 weeks ( 26 - 45 ) in ART-40W and 70 weeks ( 35 - 109 ) in ART-96W ; at the end of the trial , 19 % of patients in ART-40W and 32 % of patients in ART-96W remained off ART . Proportions of follow-up time spent on ART were 81 % in the ART-Def group , 70 % in the ART-40W group , and 69 % in the ART-96W group . 48 ( 38 % ) of 125 children in the ART-Def group , 32 ( 25 % ) of 126 in the ART-40W group , and 26 ( 21 % ) of 126 in the ART-96W group reached the primary endpoint . The hazard ratio , relative to ART-Def , was 0\\u00b759 ( 95 % CI 0\\u00b738 - 0\\u00b793 , p=0\\u00b702 ) for ART-40W and 0\\u00b747 ( 0\\u00b727 - 0\\u00b776 , p=0\\u00b7002 ) for ART-96W . Three children in ART-Def , three in ART-40W , and one in ART-96W switched to second-line ART . INTERPRETATION Early time-limited ART had better clinical and immunological outcomes than deferred ART , with no evidence of excess disease progression during subsequent treatment interruption and less overall ART exposure than deferred ART . Longer time on primary ART permits longer subsequent interruption , with marginally better outcomes .

The prednisolone-N-acetylcysteine group received intravenous N-acetylcysteine on day 1 ( at a dose of 150 , 50 , and 100 mg per kilogram of body weight in 250 , 500 , and 1000 ml of 5 % glucose solution over a period of 30 minutes , 4 hours , and 16 hours , respectively ) and on days 2 through 5 ( 100 mg per kilogram per day in 1000 ml of 5 % glucose solution ) . The prednisolone-only group received an infusion in 1000 ml of 5 % glucose solution per day on days 1 through 5 . The primary outcome was 6-month survival . Secondary outcomes included survival at 1 and 3 months , hepatitis complications , adverse events related to N-acetylcysteine use , and changes in bilirubin levels on days 7 and 14 . RESULTS Mortality was not significantly lower in the prednisolone-N-acetylcysteine group than in the prednisolone-only group at 6 months ( 27 % vs. 38 % , P = 0.07 ) . Mortality was significantly lower at 1 month ( 8 % vs. 24 % , P = 0.006 ) but not at 3 months ( 22 % vs. 34 % , P = 0.06 ) . Death due to the hepatorenal syndrome was less frequent in the prednisolone-N-acetylcysteine group than in the prednisolone-only group at 6 months ( 9 % vs. 22 % , P = 0.02 ) . In a multivariate analysis , factors associated with 6-month survival were a younger age ( P<0.001 ) , a shorter prothrombin time ( P<0.001 ) , a lower level of bilirubin at baseline ( P<0.001 ) , and a decrease in bilirubin on day 14 ( P<0.001 ) . Infections were less frequent in the prednisolone-N-acetylcysteine group than in the prednisolone-only group ( P = 0.001 ) ; other side effects were similar in the two groups . CONCLUSIONS Although combination therapy with prednisolone plus N-acetylcysteine increased 1-month survival among patients with severe acute alcoholic hepatitis , 6-month survival , the primary outcome , was not improved .

The TRACS trial investigated a training programme for caregivers ( the London Stroke Carers Training Course , LSCTC ) on physical and psychological outcomes , including cost-effectiveness , for patients and caregivers after a disabling stroke . METHODS We undertook a pragmatic , multicentre , cluster r and omised controlled trial with a parallel cost-effectiveness analysis . Stroke units were eligible if four of five criteria used to define a stroke unit were met , a substantial number of patients on the unit had a diagnosis of stroke , staff were able to deliver the LSCTC , and most patients were discharged to a permanent place of residence . Stroke units were r and omly assigned to either LSCTC or usual care ( control group ) , stratified by geographical region and quality of care , and using blocks of size 2 . Patients with a diagnosis of stroke , likely to return home with residual disability and with a caregiver providing support were eligible . The primary outcome for patients was self-reported extended activities of daily living at 6 months , measured with the Nottingham Extended Activities of Daily Living ( NEADL ) scale . The primary outcome for caregivers was self-reported burden at 6 months , measured with the caregivers burden scale ( CBS ) . We combined patient and caregiver costs with primary outcomes and quality -adjusted life-years ( QALYs ) to assess cost-effectiveness . This trial is registered with controlled-trials.com , number IS RCT N 49208824 . FINDINGS We assessed 49 stroke units for eligibility , of which 36 were r and omly assigned to either the intervention group or the control group . Between Feb 27 , 2008 , and Feb 9 , 2010 , 928 patient and caregiver dyads were registered , of which 450 were in the intervention group , and 478 in the control group .  Patients ' self-reported extended activities of daily living did not differ between groups at 6 months ( adjusted mean NEADL score 27\\u00b74 in the intervention group versus 27\\u00b76 in the control group , difference -0\\u00b72 points [ 95 % CI -3\\u00b70 to 2\\u00b75 ] , p value=0\\u00b7866 , ICC=0\\u00b7027 ) . The caregiver burden scale did not differ between groups either ( adjusted mean CBS 45\\u00b75 in the intervention group versus 45\\u00b70 in the control group , difference 0\\u00b75 points [ 95 % CI -1\\u00b77 to 2\\u00b77 ] , p value=0\\u00b7660 , ICC=0\\u00b7013 ) . Patient and caregiver costs were similar in both groups ( length of the initial stroke admission and associated costs were \\u00a3 13,127 for the intervention group and \\u00a3 12,471 for the control group ; adjusted mean difference \\u00a3 1243 [ 95 % CI -1533 to 4019 ] ; p value=0\\u00b7380 ) . Probabilities of cost-effectiveness based on QALYs were low . INTERPRETATION In a large scale , robust evaluation , results from this study have shown no differences between the LSCTC and usual care on any of the assessed outcomes . The immediate period after stroke might not be the ideal time to deliver structured caregiver training . FUNDING Medical Research Council\\\", 'Differential enrollment into clinical trials by gender has been described previously . In 1993 , the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) Revitalization Act was enacted to promote the inclusion of women in clinical trials . The purpose of this study was to review patterns in clinical trial enrollment among studies published in a major medical journal to determine the effects of this policy . A systematic search was conducted of all articles published in the Original Articles section of The New Engl and Journal of Medicine from 1994 to 1999 . Two independent observers abstract ed information from the r and omized clinical trials using st and ardized forms . All r and omized clinical trials in which the primary end point was total mortality or included mortality in a composite end point were considered for review . Trials were analyzed for enrollment of women with respect to disease state , funding source , site of trial performance , and use of gender-specific data analysis . From 1994 to 1999 , 1322 original articles were published in The New Engl and Journal of Medicine , including 442 r and omized , controlled trials of which 120 met our inclusion criteria . On average , 24.6 % women were enrolled .  Gender-specific data analysis was performed in 14 % of the trials . The NIH Revitalization Act does not appear to have improved gender-balanced enrollment or promoted the use of gender-specific analyses in clinical trials published in an influential medical journal . Overcoming this trend will require rigorous efforts on the part of funding entities , trial investigators , and journals disseminating study results', 'BACKGROUND Current treatment recommendations for patients with polycythemia vera call for maintaining a hematocrit of less than 45 % , but this therapeutic strategy has not been tested in a r and omized clinical trial . METHODS We r and omly assigned 365 adults with JAK2-positive polycythemia vera who were being treated with phlebotomy , hydroxyurea , or both to receive either more intensive treatment ( target hematocrit , < 45 % ) ( low-hematocrit group ) or less intensive treatment ( target hematocrit , 45 to 50 % ) ( high-hematocrit group ) . The primary composite end point was the time until death from cardiovascular causes or major thrombotic events . The secondary end points were cardiovascular events , cardiovascular hospitalizations , incidence of cancer , progression to myelofibrosis , myelodysplasia or leukemic transformation , and hemorrhage . An intention-to-treat analysis was performed . RESULTS After a median follow-up of 31 months , the primary end point was recorded in 5 of 182 patients in the low-hematocrit group ( 2.7 % ) and 18 of 183 patients in the high-hematocrit group ( 9.8 % ) ( hazard ratio in the high-hematocrit group , 3.91 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 1.45 to 10.53 ; P=0.007 ) . The primary end point plus superficial-vein thrombosis occurred in 4.4 % of patients in the low-hematocrit group , as compared with 10.9 % in the high-hematocrit group ( hazard ratio , 2.69 ; 95 % CI , 1.19 to 6.12 ; P=0.02 ) . Progression to myelofibrosis , myelodysplasia or leukemic transformation , and bleeding were observed in 6 , 2 , and 2 patients , respectively , in the low-hematocrit group , as compared with 2 , 1 , and 5 patients , respectively , in the high-hematocrit group . There was no significant between-group difference in the rate of adverse events . CONCLUSIONS In patients with polycythemia vera , those with a hematocrit target of less than 45 % had a significantly lower rate of cardiovascular death and major thrombosis than did those with a hematocrit target of 45 to 50 % .

Pilot studies of treatment with arsenic trioxide with or without ATRA have shown high efficacy and reduced hematologic toxicity . METHODS We conducted a phase 3 , multicenter trial comparing ATRA plus chemotherapy with ATRA plus arsenic trioxide in patients with APL classified as low-to-intermediate risk ( white-cell count , \\u226410 \\u00d7 10(9 ) per liter ) . Patients were r and omly assigned to receive either ATRA plus arsenic trioxide for induction and consolidation therapy or st and ard ATRA-idarubicin induction therapy followed by three cycles of consolidation therapy with ATRA plus chemotherapy and maintenance therapy with low-dose chemotherapy and ATRA . The study was design ed as a noninferiority trial to show that the difference between the rates of event-free survival at 2 years in the two groups was not greater than 5 % . RESULTS Complete remission was achieved in all 77 patients in the ATRA-arsenic  trioxide group who could be evaluated ( 100 % ) and in 75 of 79 patients in the ATRA-chemotherapy group ( 95 % ) ( P=0.12 ) . The median follow-up was 34.4 months . Two-year event-free survival rates were 97 % in the ATRA-arsenic trioxide group and 86 % in the ATRA-chemotherapy group ( 95 % confidence interval for the difference , 2 to 22 percentage points ; P<0.001 for noninferiority and P=0.02 for superiority of ATRA-arsenic trioxide ) . Overall survival was also better with ATRA-arsenic trioxide ( P=0.02 ) . As compared with ATRA-chemotherapy , ATRA-arsenic trioxide was associated with less hematologic toxicity and fewer infections but with more hepatic toxicity . CONCLUSIONS ATRA plus arsenic trioxide is at least not inferior and may be superior to ATRA plus chemotherapy in the treatment of patients with low-to-intermediate-risk APL .

METHODS Patients with Alzheimer 's disease and psychosis or agitation-aggression received open-label treatment with risperidone for 16 weeks . Those who had a response to risperidone therapy were then r and omly assigned , in a double-blind fashion , to one of three regimens : continued risperidone therapy for 32 weeks ( group 1 ) , risperidone therapy for 16 weeks followed by placebo for 16 weeks ( group 2 ) , or placebo for 32 weeks ( group 3 ) . The primary outcome was the time to relapse of psychosis or agitation . RESULTS A total of 180 patients received open-label  risperidone ( mean dose , 0.97 mg daily ) . The severity of psychosis and agitation were reduced , although there was a mild increase in extrapyramidal signs ;  112 patients met the criteria for response to treatment , of whom 110 underwent r and omization . In the first 16 weeks after r and omization , the rate of relapse was higher in the group that received placebo than in the groups that received risperidone ( 60 % [ 24 of 40 patients in group 3 ] vs. 33 % [ 23 of 70 in groups 1 and 2 ] ; P=0.004 ; hazard ratio with placebo , 1.94 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 1.09 to 3.45 ; P=0.02 ) .

METHODS We conducted a double-blind , placebo-controlled trial in which 1537 patients with probable Alzheimer 's disease underwent r and omization to receive 100 mg of semagacestat , 140 mg of semagacestat , or placebo daily .  Changes in cognition from baseline to week 76 were assessed with the use of the cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer 's Disease Assessment Scale for cognition ( ADAS-cog ) , on which scores range from 0 to 70 and higher scores indicate greater cognitive impairment , and changes in functioning were assessed with the Alzheimer 's Disease Cooperative Study -Activities of Daily Living ( ADCS-ADL ) scale , on which scores range from 0 to 78 and higher scores indicate better functioning . A mixed-model repeated- measures analysis was used . RESULTS The trial was terminated before completion on the basis of a recommendation by the data and safety monitoring board . At termination , there were 189 patients in the group receiving placebo  , 153 patients in the group receiving 100 mg of semagacestat , and 121 patients in the group receiving 140 mg of semagacestat .  The ADAS-cog scores worsened in all three groups ( mean change , 6.4 points in the placebo group , 7.5 points in the group receiving 100 mg of the study drug , and 7.8 points in the group receiving 140 mg ; P=0.15 and P=0.07 , respectively , for the comparison with placebo ) . The ADCS-ADL scores also worsened in all groups ( mean change at week 76 , -9.0 points in the placebo group , -10.5 points in the 100-mg group , and -12.6 points in the 140-mg group ; P=0.14 and P<0.001 , respectively , for the comparison with placebo ) .

Bruton 's tyrosine kinase ( BTK ) , an essential component of B-cell-receptor signaling , mediates interactions with the tumor microenvironment and promotes the survival and proliferation of CLL cells . METHODS We conducted a phase 1b-2 multicenter study to assess the safety , efficacy , pharmacokinetics , and pharmacodynamics of ibrutinib ( PCI-32765 ) , a first-in-class , oral covalent inhibitor of BTK design ed for treatment of B-cell cancers , in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL or small lymphocytic lymphoma . A total of 85 patients , the majority of whom were considered to have high-risk disease , received ibrutinib orally once daily ; 51 received 420 mg , and 34 received 840 mg . RESULTS Toxic effects were predominantly grade 1 or 2 and included transient diarrhea , fatigue , and upper respiratory tract infection ; thus , patients could receive extended treatment with minimal hematologic toxic effects . The overall response rate was the same in the group that received 420 mg and the group that received 840 mg ( 71 % ) , and an additional 20 % and 15 % of patients in the respective groups had a partial response with lymphocytosis . The response was independent of clinical and genomic risk factors present before treatment , including advanced-stage disease , the number of previous therapies , and the 17p13.1 deletion . At 26 months , the estimated progression-free survival rate was 75 % and the rate of overall survival was 83 % .

DESIGN Multicenter r and omized , controlled trial with a noninferiority design based on a minimal clinical ly important difference of 2.0 % . R and omization was electronically generated ; patients were assigned to a treatment group through a Web-based program . Patients , physicians , study coordinators , health care team members , outcome adjudicators , and data analysts were blinded to interventions . ( Current Controlled Trials : IS RCT N11902170 ) . SETTING 12 tertiary care orthopedic referral centers in Canada . PATIENTS 778 patients who had elective unilateral THA between 2007 and 2010 . INTERVENTION After an initial 10 days of dalteparin prophylaxis after elective THA , patients were r and omly assigned to 28 days of dalteparin ( n = 400 ) or aspirin ( n = 386 ) . MEASUREMENTS Symptomatic VTE confirmed by objective testing ( primary efficacy outcome ) and bleeding . RESULTS Five of 398 patients ( 1.3 % ) r and omly assigned to dalteparin and 1 of 380 ( 0.3 % ) r and omly assigned to aspirin  had VTE ( absolute difference , 1.0 percentage point [ 95 % CI , -0.5 to 2.5 percentage points ] ) . Aspirin was noninferior ( P < 0.001 ) but not superior ( P = 0.22 ) to dalteparin . Clinical ly significant bleeding occurred in 5 patients ( 1.3 % ) receiving dalteparin and 2 ( 0.5 % ) receiving aspirin . The absolute between-group difference in a composite of all VTE and clinical ly significant bleeding events was 1.7 percentage points ( CI , -0.3 to 3.8 percentage points ; P = 0.091 ) in favor of aspirin . LIMITATION The study was halted prematurely because of difficulty with patient recruitment . CONCLUSION Extended prophylaxis for 28 days with aspirin was noninferior to and as safe as dalteparin for the prevention of VTE after THA in patients who initially received dalteparin for 10 days . Given its low cost and greater convenience , aspirin may be considered a reasonable alternative for extended thromboprophylaxis after THA .

After participants accepted a request to join the group , participation was voluntary . Group participation and engagement were monitored . Participants could request a free , home-based HIV testing kit and completed question naires at baseline and 12-week follow-up . MEASUREMENTS Participant acceptance of and engagement in the intervention and social network participation , rates of home-based HIV testing , and sexual risk behaviors . RESULTS Almost 95 % of intervention participants and 73 % of control participants voluntarily communicated using the social platform . Twenty-five of 57 intervention participants ( 44 % ) requested home-based HIV testing kits compared with 11 of 55 control participants ( 20 % ) ( difference , 24 percentage points [ 95 % CI , 8 to 41 percentage points ] ) . Nine of the 25 intervention participants ( 36 % ) who requested the test took it and mailed it back compared with 2 of the 11 control participants ( 18 % ) who requested the test . Retention at study follow-up was more than 93 % . LIMITATION Only 2 Facebook communities were included for each group . CONCLUSION Social networking communities are acceptable and effective tools to increase home-based HIV testing among at-risk population s.

The European R and omized study of Screening for Prostate cancer ( ERSPC ) was initiated in 1994 . Eight countries including France are participating . METHODS ERSPC is a multicentric r and omised study and started with the aim to determine whether a 20 % reduction in prostate cancer mortality can be achieved with PSA-based screening .  Men aged 50 - 74 and living in the Tarn or H\\u00e9rault were included . After r and omization and exclusion of men who died or had a prostate cancer were invited to participate by giving their consent and had a PSA test . In case of PSA greater than or equal to 3 ng/ml , biopsy was recommended . Included men in both screening and control group were followed through cancer registries . Objective was to present first round results of French participation to ERSPC , to determine factors of participation and to compare detected cancers cases between both groups . RESULTS Population of men included was 84,781 and were r and omized in screening ( n=42,590 ) or control ( n=42,191 ) group .  Participation rate was 36.9 % in Tarn and 24.3 % in H\\u00e9rault . PSA was greater than or equal to 3 ng/ml in 15,4 % of cases ( n=1812 ) and 45.9 % of men ( n=832 ) who were biopsied . Age , previous PSA performed within two years prior to invitation , health insurance and department of residence were significantly associated to participation rate . Cumulated incidence with a four years follow-up was 2.48 % ( n=1053 ) in screening and 1.99 % ( n=840 ) in control group , with a relative risk ( RR ) of 1.242 . Corresponding RR for Tarn and H\\u00e9rault were 1.37 and 1.20 respectively . Clinical parameters and treatments modalities were similar between both screening and control groups ( radical prostatectomy 68 % and radiation therapy 20 % ) . CONCLUSION Participation rate at first round was modest . Profile of men who participated compared to men who did not were different . The control group was probably contaminated by PSA testing outside study protocol . Consequences at ERSPC level of this low participation rate on final analysis remain to be determined', 'The objectives of the Prostate , Lung , Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial are to determine in screenees ages 55 - 74 at entry whether screening with flexible sigmoidoscopy ( 60-cm sigmoidoscope ) can reduce mortality from colorectal cancer , whether screening with chest X-ray can reduce mortality from lung cancer , whether screening men with digital rectal examination ( DRE ) plus serum prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) can reduce mortality from prostate cancer , and whether screening women with CA125 and transvaginal ultrasound ( TVU ) can reduce mortality from ovarian cancer . Secondary objectives are to assess screening variables other than mortality for each of the interventions including sensitivity , specificity , and positive predictive value ; to assess incidence , stage , and survival of cancer cases ; and to investigate biologic and /or prognostic characterizations of tumor tissue and biochemical products as intermediate endpoints . The design is a multicenter , two-armed , r and omized trial with 37,000 females and 37,000 males in each of the two arms . In the intervention arm , the  PSA and CA125 tests  are performed at entry , then annually for 5 years . The  DRE , TVU , and chest X-ray exams  are performed at entry and then annually for 3 years . Sigmoidoscopy is performed at entry and then at the 5-year point . Participants in the control arm follow their usual medical care practice s. Participants will be followed for at least 13 years from r and omization to ascertain all cancers of the prostate , lung , colorectum , and ovary , as well as deaths from all causes . A pilot phase was undertaken to assess the r and omization , screening , and data collection procedures of the trial and to estimate design parameters such as compliance and contamination levels . This paper describes eligibility , consent , and other design features of the trial , r and omization and screening procedures , and an outline of the follow-up procedures . Sample -size calculations are reported , and a data analysis plan is presented', 'BACKGROUND Prostate cancer ( PC ) screening with prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) has been shown to decrease PC mortality by the European R and omized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer ( ERSPC ) . We evaluated mortality results in the Finnish Prostate Cancer Screening Trial , the largest component of ERSPC . The primary endpoint was PC-specific mortality . METHODS A total of 80 144 men were identified from the population registry and r and omized to either a  screening arm ( SA ) or a  control arm ( CA ) . Men in the SA were invited to serum PSA determination up to three times with a 4-year interval between each scan and referred to biopsy if the PSA concentration was greater than or equal to 4.0 ng/mL or 3.0 to 3.99 ng/mL with a free/total PSA ratio less than or equal to 16 % . Men in the CA received usual care . The analysis covers follow-up to 12 years from r and omization for all men . Hazard ratios ( HRs ) were estimated for incidence and mortality using Cox proportional hazard model . All statistical tests were two-sided . RESULTS PC incidence was 8.8 per 1000 person-years in the SA and 6.6 in the CA ( HR = 1.34 , 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] = 1.27 to 1.40 ) . The incidence of advanced PC was lower in the SA vs CA arm ( 1.2 vs 1.6 , respectively ; HR = 0.73 , 95 % CI = 0.64 to 0.82 ; P < .001 ) . For PC mortality , no statistically significant difference was observed between the SA and CA ( HR = 0.85 , 95 % CI = 0.69 to 1.04 ) ( with intention-to-screen analysis ) . To avoid one PC death , we needed to invite 1199 men to screening and to detect 25 PCs . We observed no difference in all-cause mortality between trial arms . CONCLUSIONS At 12 years , a relatively conservative screening protocol produced a small , non-statistically significant PC-specific mortality reduction in the Finnish trial , at the cost of moderate overdiagnosis', 'BACKGROUND Prostate cancer is one of the leading causes of death from malignant disease among men in the developed world . One strategy to decrease the risk of death from this disease is screening with prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) ; however , the extent of benefit and harm with such screening is under continuous debate . METHODS In December , 1994 , 20,000 men born between 1930 and 1944 , r and omly sample d from the population register , were r and omised by computer in a 1:1 ratio to either a screening group invited for PSA testing every 2 years ( n=10,000 ) or to a control group not invited ( n=10,000 ) . Men in the screening group were invited up to the upper age limit ( median 69 , range 67 - 71 years ) and only men with raised PSA concentrations were offered additional tests such as digital rectal examination and prostate biopsies . The primary endpoint was prostate-cancer specific mortality , analysed according to the intention-to-screen principle . The study is ongoing , with men who have not reached the upper age limit invited for PSA testing . This is the first planned report on cumulative prostate-cancer incidence and mortality calculated up to Dec 31 , 2008 . This study is registered as an International St and ard R and omised Controlled Trial IS RCT N54449243 . FINDINGS In each group , 48 men were excluded from the analysis because of death or emigration before the r and omisation date , or prevalent prostate cancer . In men r and omised to screening , 7578 ( 76 % ) of 9952 attended at least once . During a median follow-up of 14 years , 1138 men in the screening group and 718 in the control group  were diagnosed with prostate cancer , result ing in a cumulative prostate-cancer incidence of 12.7 % in the screening group and 8.2 % in the  control  group ( hazard ratio 1.64 ; 95 % CI 1.50 - 1.80 ; p<0.0001 ) . The absolute cumulative risk reduction of death from prostate cancer at 14 years was 0.40 % ( 95 % CI 0.17 - 0.64 ) , from 0.90 % in the control group to 0.50 % in the screening group . The rate ratio for death from prostate cancer was 0.56 ( 95 % CI 0.39 - 0.82 ; p=0.002 ) in the screening compared with the control group . The rate ratio of death from prostate cancer for attendees compared with the control group was 0.44 ( 95 % CI 0.28 - 0.68 ; p=0.0002 ) . Overall , 293 ( 95 % CI 177 - 799 ) men needed to be invited for screening and 12 to be diagnosed to prevent one prostate cancer death . INTERPRETATION This study shows that prostate cancer mortality was reduced almost by half over 14 years . However , the risk of over-diagnosis is substantial and the number needed to treat is at least as high as in breast-cancer screening programmes . The benefit of prostate-cancer screening compares favourably to other cancer screening programs . FUNDING The Swedish Cancer Society , the Swedish Research Council , and the National Cancer Institute', 'Objective To assess whether screening for prostate cancer reduces prostate cancer specific mortality . Design Population based r and omised controlled trial . Setting Department of Urology , Norrk\\u00f6ping , and the South-East Region Prostate Cancer Register . Participants All men aged 50 - 69 in the city of Norrk\\u00f6ping , Sweden , identified in 1987 in the National Population Register ( n=9026 ) . Intervention From the study population , 1494 men were r and omly allocated to be screened by including every sixth man from a list of date s of birth . These men were invited to be screened every third year from 1987 to 1996 . On the first two occasions screening was done by digital rectal examination only . From 1993 , this was combined with prostate specific antigen testing , with 4 \\u00b5g/L as cut off . On the fourth occasion ( 1996 ) , only men aged 69 or under at the time of the investigation were invited . Main outcome measures Data on tumour stage , grade , and treatment from the South East Region Prostate Cancer Register . Prostate cancer specific mortality up to 31 December 2008 . Results In the four screenings from 1987 to 1996 attendance was 1161/1492 ( 78 % ) , 957/1363 ( 70 % ) , 895/1210 ( 74 % ) , and 446/606 ( 74 % ) , respectively . There were 85 cases ( 5.7 % ) of prostate cancer diagnosed in the screened group and 292 ( 3.9 % ) in the control group . The risk ratio for death from prostate cancer in the screening group was 1.16 ( 95 % confidence interval 0.78 to 1.73 ) . In a Cox proportional hazard analysis comparing prostate cancer specific survival in the control group with that in the screened group , the hazard ratio for death from prostate cancer was 1.23 ( 0.94 to 1.62 ; P=0.13 ) . After adjustment for age at start of the study , the hazard ratio was 1.58 ( 1.06 to 2.36 ; P=0.024 ) . Conclusions After 20 years of follow-up the rate of death from prostate cancer did not differ significantly between men in the screening group and those in the  control group . Trial registration Current Controlled Trials , IS RCT N06342431', 'BACKGROUND The effect of screening with prostate-specific-antigen ( PSA ) testing and digital rectal examination on the rate of death from prostate cancer is unknown . This is the first report from the Prostate , Lung , Colorectal , and Ovarian ( PLCO ) Cancer Screening Trial on prostate-cancer mortality . METHODS From 1993 through 2001 , we r and omly assigned 76,693 men at 10 U.S. study centers to receive either annual screening ( 38,343 subjects ) or usual care as the control ( 38,350 subjects ) . Men in the screening group were offered annual PSA testing for 6 years and digital rectal examination for 4 years . The subjects and health care providers received the results and decided on the type of follow-up evaluation . Usual care sometimes included screening , as some organizations have recommended . The numbers of all cancers and deaths and causes of death were ascertained . RESULTS In the screening group , rates of compliance were 85 % for PSA testing and 86 % for digital rectal examination . Rates of screening in the control group increased from 40 % in the first year to 52 % in the sixth year for PSA testing and ranged from 41 to 46 % for digital rectal examination . After 7 years of follow-up , the incidence of prostate cancer per 10,000 person-years was 116 ( 2820 cancers ) in the screening group and 95 ( 2322 cancers ) in the control group ( rate ratio , 1.22 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 1.16 to 1.29 ) . The incidence of death per 10,000 person-years was 2.0 ( 50 deaths ) in the screening group and 1.7 ( 44 deaths ) in the control group ( rate ratio , 1.13 ; 95 % CI , 0.75 to 1.70 ) . The data at 10 years were 67 % complete and consistent with these overall findings . CONCLUSIONS After 7 to 10 years of follow-up , the rate of death from prostate cancer was very low and did not differ significantly between the two study groups . ( Clinical Trials.gov number , NCT00002540 .', 'BACKGROUND The prostate component of the Prostate , Lung , Colorectal , and Ovarian ( PLCO ) Cancer Screening Trial was undertaken to determine whether there is a reduction in prostate cancer mortality from screening using serum prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) testing and digital rectal examination ( DRE ) . Mortality after 7 - 10 years of follow-up has been reported previously . We report extended follow-up to 13 years after the trial . METHODS A total of 76 685 men , aged 55 - 74 years , were enrolled at 10 screening centers between November 1993 and July 2001 and r and omly assigned to the intervention  ( organized screening of annual PSA testing for 6 years and annual DRE for 4 years ; 38 340 men ) and control ( usual care , which sometimes included opportunistic screening ; 38 345 men ) arms . Screening was completed in October 2006 . All incident prostate cancers and deaths from prostate cancer through 13 years of follow-up or through December 31 , 2009 , were ascertained . Relative risks ( RRs ) were estimated as the ratio of observed rates in the intervention and control arms , and 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs ) were calculated assuming a Poisson distribution for the number of events . Poisson regression modeling was used to examine the interactions with respect to prostate cancer mortality between trial arm and age , comorbidity status , and pretrial PSA testing . All statistical tests were two-sided . RESULTS Approximately 92 % of the study participants were followed to 10 years and 57 % to 13 years . At 13 years , 4250 participants had been diagnosed with prostate cancer in the intervention arm compared with 3815 in the control arm . Cumulative incidence rates for prostate cancer in the intervention and control arms were 108.4 and 97.1 per 10 000 person-years , respectively , result ing in a relative increase of 12 % in the intervention arm ( RR = 1.12 , 95 % CI = 1.07 to 1.17 ) . After 13 years of follow-up , the cumulative mortality rates from prostate cancer in the intervention and control arms were 3.7 and 3.4 deaths per 10 000 person-years , respectively , result ing in a non-statistically significant difference between the two arms ( RR = 1.09 , 95 % CI = 0.87 to 1.36 ) . No statistically significant interactions with respect to prostate cancer mortality were observed between trial arm and age ( P(interaction ) = .81 ) , pretrial PSA testing ( P(interaction ) = .52 ) , and comorbidity ( P(interaction ) = .68 ) . CONCLUSIONS After 13 years of follow-up , there was no evidence of a mortality benefit for organized annual screening in the PLCO trial compared with opportunistic screening , which forms part of usual care , and there was no apparent interaction with age , baseline comorbidity , or pretrial PSA testing', \\\"PURPOSE This clinical trial is aim ed at evaluating the impact of prostate cancer screening on cancer-specific mortality . SUBJECTS AND METHODS Forty-six thous and four hundred and eighty-six ( 46,486 ) men aged 45 - 80 years registered in the electoral roll of the Quebec city area were r and omized in 1988 between screening and no screening . Screening included measurement of serum prostatic specific antigen ( PSA ) using 3.0 ng/ml as upper limit of normal and digital rectal examination ( DRE ) at first visit . At follow-up visits , serum PSA only was used . RESULTS Seventy-four ( 74 ) deaths from prostate cancer occurred in the 14,231 unscreened controls while 10 deaths were observed in the screened group of 7,348 men during the first 11 years following r and omization . Median follow-up of screened men was 7.93 years . A Cox proportional hazards model of the age at death from prostate cancer shows a 62 % reduction ( P < 0.002 , Fisher 's exact test ) of cause-specific mortality in the screened men ( P = 0.005 ) . These results are in agreement with the continuous decrease of prostate cancer mortality observed in North America\\\", 'BACKGROUND The incidence of prostate cancer has increased substantially since it became common practice to screen asymptomatic men for the disease . The European R and omized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer ( ERSPC ) was initiated in 1993 to determine how prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) screening affects prostate cancer mortality . Variations in the screening algorithm , such as the interval between screening rounds , likely influence the morbidity , mortality , and quality of life of the screened population . METHODS We compared the number and characteristics of interval cancers , defined as those diagnosed during the screening interval but not detected by screening , in men in the screening arm of the ERSPC who were aged 55 - 65 years at the time of the first screening and were participating through two centers of the ERSPC : Gothenburg ( 2-year screening interval , n = 4202 ) and Rotterdam ( 4-year screening interval , n = 13301 ) . All participants who were diagnosed with prostate cancer through December 31 , 2005 , but at most 10 years after the initial screening were ascertained by linkage with the national cancer registries . A potentially life-threatening ( aggressive ) interval cancer was defined as one with at least one of the following characteristics at diagnosis : stage M1 or N1 , plasma PSA concentration greater than 20.0 ng/mL , or Gleason score greater than 7 . We used Mantel Cox regression to assess differences between rates of interval cancers and aggressive interval cancers at the two centers . All statistical tests were two-sided . RESULTS The 10-year cumulative incidence of all prostate cancers in Rotterdam versus Gothenburg was 1118 ( 8.41 % ) versus 552 ( 13.14 % ) ( P<.001 ) , the cumulative incidence of interval cancer was 57 ( 0.43 % ) versus 31 ( 0.74 % ) ( P = .51 ) , and the cumulative incidence of aggressive interval cancer was 15 ( 0.11 % ) versus 5 ( 0.12 % ) ( P = .72 ) . CONCLUSION The rate of interval cancer , especially aggressive interval cancer , was low in this study . The 2-year screening interval had higher detection rates than the 4-year interval but did not lead to lower rates of interval and aggressive interval prostate cancers', 'The extent of effective prostate\\u2010specific antigen ( PSA ) contamination in the Rotterdam section of the ongoing European R and omized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer ( ERSPC ) trial was evaluated and defined as when opportunistic PSA testing of \\u2265 3.0 ng/ml was followed by biopsy , similar to the regular procedure within the trial . Records of participants aged 55\\u201374 years at entry were linked to the regional data base of the general practitioner ( GP ) laboratory to obtain PSA tests requested by GPs in the period 1 July 1997 to 31 May 2000 ( 2.9 years ) , and to the national pathology data base to quantify the number of biopsies . All men r and omized were included , only those with prostate cancer screen\\u2010detected or clinical ly diagnosed before July 1997 were omitted from the analyses . 2,895 out of the 14,349 men ( 20.2 % ) in the control arm and 1,981 out of the 14,052 men ( 14.1 % ) in the screening arm were  PSA\\u2010tested  , at an average annual rate of 73 and 52 per 1,000 person\\u2010years , respectively . These rates were higher than those recorded at the national and regional levels , 33 and 38 per 1,000 person\\u2010years , respectively . Opportunistic PSA testing in the control arm reached a peak within the first months of r and omization , after which it decreased to around 70 per 1,000 person\\u2010years . An opposite pattern was observed in the screening arm , where participants already had received the scheduled screening within the trial . The proportion of men in the control arm with PSA \\u2265 3.0 ng/ml followed by biopsy and prostate cancer was 7\\u20138 % and 3 % , respectively ( 3 % and 0.4\\u20130.6 % in the screening arm ) , over the whole study period . Over a 4\\u2010year rescreening interval , the average PSA and effective contamination amount were approximately 28 % and 10 % , respectively . PSA testing in the control arm in the Rotterdam ERSPC section is high , but was not followed by a substantial increase in prostate biopsies . Although the reasons for ordering PSA test or indicating biopsy are unknown , effective PSA contamination in the Rotterdam ERSPC section is low and not likely to jeopardize the power of the trial . \\u00a9 2003 Wiley\\u2010Liss ,', 'OBJECTIVE To address if prostate cancer ( PCa ) screening decreases PCa mortality in the asymptomatic population , within the setting of the Spanish arm of the European R and omized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer ( ERSPC ) . MATERIAL AND METHODS From 1996 to 1999 , 4,278 men aged 45 - 70 years were recruited and r and omized to the screening arm ( PSA every 4 years , prostate biopsy when PSA \\u22653 ng/ml ) and control arm ( no tests ) . Date s and causes of death were collected on an annual basis . A Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to calculate overall and cancer-specific survival . RESULTS A total of 2,416 men were recruited in the screening arm and 1,862 in the control arm . Mean age was 57.8 years , median follow-up was 13.3 years . At the end of the follow-up period , 427 deaths ( 9 from PCa ) were observed . Survival analysis did not show any difference between the study arms with respect to overall and cancer-specific survival ( p=0.939 and p=0.544 respectively ) . Most relevant causes of death were malignant tumors ( 52.9 % ) , cardiovascular disease ( 17.3 % ) and respiratory ( 8.9 % ) . Only 2.1 % of deaths ( 0.2 % of all recruited men ) were due to PCa ( 2.5 % screening , 1.6 % control ) . CONCLUSIONS The Spanish arm of ERSPC failed to reproduce the long-term results shown in the whole study . No differences in mortality ( overall or cancer-specific ) were observed after 15 years of follow-up . PCa mortality was infrequent ( less than 1 % ) . These results suggest limited yield of PCa screening in our setting', 'Screening for prostate cancer ( PC ) remains a controversial issue despite some new evidence on the mortality benefits of PC screening . We conducted a prospect i ve , r and omized screening trial in Finl and to investigate whether screening decreases PC incidence . Here , we report the incidence results from three screening rounds during a 12-year period . Of the 80,144 men enrolled , 31,866 men were r and omized to the screening arm ( SA ) and invited for screening with prostate-specific antigen test ( cut-off 4.0 ng/ml ) every 4 years , while the remaining men formed the control arm ( CA ) that received no interventions . The mean follow-up time for PC incidence in both arms was over 9 years . The incidence rate of PC ( including screen-detected and interval cancers as well as cases among non participants ) was 9.1 per 1,000 person-years in the SA and 6.2 in the CA , yielding an incidence rate ratio ( IRR ) 1.5 ( 95 % confidence interval 1.4 - 1.5 ) . The incidence of advanced PC was 1.1 in the SA and 1.5 in the CA , IRR = 0.7 ( 0.6 - 0.8 ) and the difference emerges after 5 - 6 years of follow-up . The incidence of localized PC was 7.5 in the SA and 4.6 in the CA , IRR = 1.6 ( 1.5 - 1.7 ) . The results from our large population -based trial indicate that screening for PC decreases the incidence of advanced PC . When compared with the CA , the PC detected in the SA there were substantially more often localized , low- grade PCs due to overdiagnosis', \\\"To report the results from  Switzerl and 's participation in the ERSPC from 1998 ; importantly , epidemiological data showed that Switzerl and has one of the highest rates of morbidity and mortality from prostate cancer in the world . The local study protocol was accepted by the ethical committee and after the successful pilot study phase , the centre joined the ERSPC\\\", 'BACKGROUND Screening for prostate cancer ( PC ) with prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) has been shown to decrease mortality , but has adverse effects , such as false-positive ( FP ) screening results . We describe the frequency of FP results and assess their relation to subsequent screening attendance , test results and prostate cancer risk in a large r and omized trial . MATERIAL S AND METHODS We included data from five centres of the European R and omized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer , altogether over 61,000 screened men . Men were screened with PSA test at a 2 - 7 year interval depending on the centre ; PSA cut-off was 3.0 - 4.0 ng/ml . A positive screen with no histologically confirmed PC in biopsy within 1 year was defined as an FP result . RESULTS Of the 61,604 men who were screened at least once , 17.8 % had one or more FP result ( s ) . Almost 20 % of men who participated at all screening rounds had one or more FP result ( s ) . More than half of the men with an FP result had another FP if screened again . Men with FP results had a fourfold risk of PC at subsequent screen ( depending on the round , 10.0 % versus 2.6 - 2.7 % of men with negative screen , risk ratio 3.8 - 3.9 ) . The PCs following an FP result were in 92.8 % of cases localised and low- grade versus 90.4 % following a screen-negative result . CONCLUSIONS Our results show that FP results are common adverse effects in PC screening , as they affect at least one in six screened men . False-positive men are more prone to be diagnosed with PC but are also likely to have consistently high PSA levels', \\\"PURPOSE Estimates of prostate cancer-specific mortality ( PCSM ) were similar for men r and omly assigned to intervention compared with usual care  on the Prostate , Lung , Colorectal and Ovarian PC screening study . However , results analyzed by comorbidity strata remain unknown . PATIENTS AND METHODS Between 1993 and 2001 , of 76,693 men who were r and omly assigned to usual care or intervention at 10 US centers , 73,378 ( 96 % ) completed a question naire that inquired about comorbidity and prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) testing before r and om assignment . Fine and Gray 's multivariable analysis was performed to assess whether the r and omized screening arm was associated with the risk of PCSM in men with no or minimal versus at least one significant comorbidity , adjusting for age and prer and omization PSA testing . RESULTS After 10 years of follow-up , 9,565 deaths occurred , 164 from PC . A significant decrease in the risk of PCSM ( 22 v 38 deaths ; adjusted hazard ratio [ AHR ] , 0.56 ; 95 % CI , 0.33 to 0.95 ; P = .03 ) was observed in men with no or minimal comorbidity r and omly assigned to intervention versus usual care , and the additional number needed to treat to prevent one PC death at 10 years was five . Among men with at least one significant comorbidity , those r and omly assigned to intervention versus usual care did not have a decreased risk of PCSM ( 62 v 42 deaths ; AHR , 1.43 ; 95 % CI , 0.96 to 2.11 ; P = .08 ) . CONCLUSION Selective use of PSA screening for men in good health appears to reduce the risk of PCSM with minimal overtreatment\\\", 'The specific details of the French national programme are based on the design of a local mass screening programme .  Men in the screening group are repeatedly invited by mail to be screened while no information other that the national available guidelines on the use of prostate\\u2010specific antigen ( PSA ) is offered to the control group . The protocol includes r and omization before information and consent . In addition , knowledge of any pre\\u2010existing PSA test is obtained through the health insurance data base . This will allow separate analysis , if necessary , between groups with previous PSA testing ( low participation rate expected ) and without ( higher participation rate expected )', 'From 1992 - 2001 , 7 countries in Europe gradually recruited men for the European R and omised Screening for Prostate Cancer ( ERSPC ) trial . Centres recruit different age groups and have different design s for recruiting and countries have different underlying risks for prostate cancer . Recruitment has reached 163,126 men aged 55 - 69 at entry now . Our purpose was to calculate the power of the trial and at what point in time can statistically significant differences in prostate cancer mortality be expected . Recruitment data were collected from the screening centres .  We calculated the expected number of prostate cancer deaths in each follow-up year , based on national statistics and expected rate in trial entrants . The power was calculated using different assumptions on intervention effect and contamination rate and also if the ERSPC trial would cooperate with other trials . With an assumed 25 % intervention effect in men actually screened and a 20 % contamination rate , the trial will reach a power of 0.86 in 2008 . With an assumed intervention effect of 40 % , the power reaches 0.90 in 2003 - 2004 . Pooling data with those of the Prostate , Lung , Colorectal and Ovary ( PLCO ) trial early is expected to improve the power to 79 % ( 20 % intervention effect ) to 92 % ( 40 % intervention effect PLCO ) . Adding more centres with compliance rates lower than 45 % decreases the power of the trial . The ERSPC trial has sufficient power to detect a significant difference in prostate cancer mortality between the 2 arms if the true reduction in mortality by screening is 25 % or more or if contamination remains limited to 10 % if the true effect is 20 % or more . If early detection and treatment turns out to have a stronger effect as may be suggested by observational data , the ERSPC trial is likely to conclusively show that within the next 5 years', 'Two large\\u2010scale r and omized screening trials , the Prostate , Lung , Colorectal and Ovary ( PLCO ) cancer trial in the USA and the European R and omized Screening for Prostate Cancer ( ERSPC ) trial in Europe are currently under way , aim ed at assessing whether screening reduces prostate cancer mortality . Up to the end of 1998 , 102,691 men have been r and omized to the intervention arm and 115,322 to the control arm ( which represents 83 % of the target sample size ) from 7 European countries and 10 screening centers in the USA . The principal screening method at all centers is determination of  serum prostate\\u2010specific antigen ( PSA ) . The PLCO trial and some European centers use also  digital rectal examination ( DRE )  as an ancillary screening test . In the core age group ( 55\\u201369 years ) , 3,362 of 32,486 men screened ( 10 % ) had a  serum PSA concentration of 4 ng/ml or greater , which is 1 cut\\u2010off for biopsy ( performed in 84 % ) . An additional 6 % was referred for further assessment based on other criteria , with much less efficiency . Differences in PSA by country are largely attributable to the age structure of the study population . The mean age\\u2010specific PSA levels are lower in the PLCO trial ( 1.64 ng/ml [ in the age group 55\\u201359 years ] , 1.80 [ 60\\u201364 years ] and 2.18 [ 65\\u201369 years ) than in the ERSPC trial ( 1.28\\u20131.71 [ 55\\u201359 ] , 1.75\\u20132.87 [ 60\\u201364 ] and 2.48\\u20133.06 [ 65\\u201369 years ] ) . Detection rates at the first screen in the ERSPC trial range from 11 to 42/1,000 men screened and reflect underlying differences in incidence rates and screening procedures . In centers with consent to r and omization design , adherence in the screening arm is 91 % , but less than half of the men in the target population are enrolled in the trial . In population \\u2010based centers in which men were r and omized prior to consent , all eligible subjects are enrolled , but only about two\\u2010thirds of the men in the intervention arm undergo screening . Considerable progress has been made in both trials . Enrollment will be completed in 2001 . A substantial number of early prostate cancers have been detected . The differences between countries seem to reflect both underlying prostate cancer incidence and screening policy .

This public health problem is becoming increasingly important due to the increasing life expectancy . At the present time , prostate cancer will be discovered in one in every eight men during their lifetime . Prostate cancer represents 25 % of all new cases of male cancers . Prostate cancer screening is design ed to detect early stage , asymptomatic prostate cancer , as the patient 's chances of cure are higher when the cancer is diagnosed at an early stage . The conclusions of the ANAES evaluation in 1998 did not recommend mass screening for prostate cancer . Several international prospect i ve r and omized studies based on serum PSA assay , sometimes associated with digital rectal examination , are currently underway . France is participating in the European ERSPC study ( European R and omized Study of Screening for Cancer Prostate ) and is organizing a national study on high-risk population s. While waiting for the final results of these studies , a recommendation needs to be proposed to inform general practitioners and specialists about optimal use of the currently available tests . Based on the conclusions of its oncology committee ( composed of urologists , medical oncologists , radiotherapists , pathologists and radiologists ) , the Association Fran\\u00e7aise d'Urologie proposes a recommendation concerning prostate cancer screening and defines its modalities , especially concerning the target population , screening tests and the information given to men before screening . The Association Fran\\u00e7aise d'Urologie recommends prostate cancer screening by PSA assay ( prostate specific antigen ) and digital rectal examination annually between the ages of 50 and 75 years , and from the age of 45 years in men with a family or ethnic risk . If total PSA is above the normal value of the test or if digital rectal examination is abnormal , referral to a urologist is recommended . Information concerning the limits , benefits and risks of screening and the available treatment options must be given before performing these examinations\\\", 'OBJECTIVE To test the feasibility of a population -based prostate cancer screening programme in general practice and explore the outcome after a 15-year follow-up period . METHODS From the total population of men aged 50 - 69 years in Norrk\\u00f6ping ( n = 9026 ) every sixth man ( n = 1494 ) was r and omly selected to be screened for prostate cancer every third year over a 12-year period . The remaining 7532 men were treated as controls . In 1987 and 1990 only  digital rectal examination ( DRE )  was performed , in 1993 and 1996 DRE was combined with a test for Prostate-Specific Antigen ( PSA ) .  TNM categories , grade of malignancy , management and cause of death were recorded in the South-East Region Prostate Cancer Register . RESULTS There were 85 ( 5.7 % ) cancers detected in the screened group ( SG ) , 42 of these in the interval between screenings , and 292 ( 3.8 % ) in the unscreened group ( UG ) . In the SG 48 ( 56.5 % ) of the tumours and in the UG 78 ( 26.7 % ) were localised at diagnosis ( p < 0.001 ) . In the SG 21 ( 25 % ) and in the UG 41 ( 14 % ) received curative treatment . There was no significant difference in total or prostate cancer-specific survival between the groups . CONCLUSIONS Although PSA had not been introduced in the clinical practice at the start of the study , we were still able to show that it is possible to perform a long-term population -based r and omised controlled study with st and ardised management and that screening in general practice is an efficient way of detecting prostate cancer whilst it is localised . Complete data on stage , treatment and mortality for both groups was obtained from a vali date d cancer register , which is a fundamental prerequisite when assessing screening programmes', 'OBJECTIVE To describe the natural history of initially untreated early-stage prostate cancer . A key secondary objective was to calculate long-term survival rates by stage , grade , and age at diagnosis . DESIGN Prospect i ve cohort study . SETTING Population -based in 1 county of Sweden , without screening for prostate cancer . PATIENTS A group of 642 patients with prostate cancer of any stage , consecutively diagnosed between 1977 and 1984 at a mean age of 72 years with complete follow-up to 1994 . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Proportion of patients who died from prostate cancer , and 15-year survival ( with 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] ) , corrected for causes of death other than prostate cancer . RESULTS In the entire cohort , prostate cancer accounted for 201 ( 37 % ) of all 541 deaths . Among 300 patients with a diagnosis of localized disease ( T0-T2 ) , 33 ( 11 % ) died of prostate cancer . In this group , the corrected 15-year survival rate was similar in 223 patients with deferred treatment ( 81 % ; 95 % CI , 72%-89 % ) and in 77 who received initial treatment ( 81 % ; 95 % CI , 67%-95 % ) . The corrected 15-year survival was 57 % ( 95 % CI , 45%-68 % ) in 183 patients with locally advanced cancer ( T3-T4 ) and 6 % ( 95 % CI , 0%-12 % ) in those 159 who had distant metastases at the time of diagnosis . CONCLUSION Patients with localized prostate cancer have a favorable outlook following watchful waiting , and the number of deaths potentially avoidable by radical initial treatment is limited . Without reliable prognostic indicators , an aggressive approach to all patients with early disease would entail substantial overtreatment . In contrast , patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease need trials of aggressive therapy to improve their poor prognosis', 'PURPOSE We evaluated long-term survival in attendees and nonattendees of a 1-time screening for prostate cancer . MATERIAL S AND METHODS A total of 2,400 men 55 to 70 years old in 1988 were r and omly selected and invited to a screening for prostate cancer . Of the invited men 1,782 ( 74 % ) attended . Screening attendees were examined with digital rectal examination , transrectal ultrasound and prostate specific antigen analysis .  When cancer was suspected , prostate biopsies were taken . A total of 65 men with prostate cancer were detected by this procedure . The entire source population comprising 27,204 men , including 618 nonattendees ( 26 % ) , was followed for prostate cancer diagnosis and survival for 15 years . RESULTS Incidence rate ratios were calculated using Poisson regression models . We found no effect of this screening procedure on the risk of death from prostate cancer and other causes of death ( incidence rate ratio 1.10 , 95 % CI 0.83 - 1.46 and 0.98 , 95 % CI 0.92 - 1.05 , respectively ) when comparing all invited men with the source population . However , attending the screening program was associated with a significantly decreased risk of death from causes other than prostate cancer ( vs source population incidence rate ratio 0.82 , 95 % CI 0.76 - 0.90 ) . In contrast , the corresponding incidence rate ratio in nonattendees was 1.53 ( 95 % CI 1.37 - 1.71 ) . CONCLUSIONS We found no evidence of a beneficial effect of this specific screening procedure but strong evidence of a difference in overall survival in screening attendees and nonattendees . These findings should be considered when interpreting previous and upcoming studies of the effect of screening programs', 'OBJECTIVES R and omized controlled trials are currently conducted to assess whether the mortality from prostate cancer is reduced by early detection with the use of prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) measurements in serum . To be effective , such a program should be able to reduce the absolute number of men diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer ( for which no cure is available ) . The aim of the present report is to evaluate whether PSA-based screening reduces the risk of being diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer .

Ten thous and , r and omly selected men aged 50 - 66 yr were invited for biennial PSA testing , with 10,000 men serving as passive controls for whom diagnosis of metastatic prostate cancer was monitored by using the Swedish Cancer Registry . RESULTS After a follow-up of 10 yr , the risk of being diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer was reduced by 48.9%-that is , decreasing from 47 cases in the control group to 24 cases in the group r and omized to PSA-based screening ( p=0.0084 ) . However , the risk of being diagnosed with prostate cancer increased 1.8-fold with PSA-based screening . CONCLUSIONS Biennial PSA screening reduces the risk of being diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer , the first prerequisite for achieving decreased cancer mortality  in younger men . This putative benefit is balanced by a 1.8-fold increased risk for diagnosis of prostate cancer', 'To report the initial results from Sweden of a large population \\u2010based r and omized study of screening using prostate\\u2010specific antigen ( PSA ) to detect prostate cancer , as the efficacy of such screening to decrease prostate cancer mortality has not yet been proven', 'BACKGROUND Evidence from r and omized trials on the effects of screening for prostate cancer ( PCa ) on disease-specific mortality accumulates slowly with increasing follow-up .

DESIGN , SETTING , AND PARTICIPANTS A r and omized controlled trial with r and omization after signed , written informed consent ( efficacy trial ) . In the period 1993 - 1999 , a total of 42 376 men aged 54 - 74 yr were r and omized to a screening arm ( S-arm )  ( n = 21 210 with screening every 4 yr , applying a total prostate-specific antigen [ PSA ] level cut-off \\u2265 3.0 ng/ml as biopsy indication ) or a control arm ( C-arm ) ( n = 21 166 ; no intervention ) . OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Number of PCas detected per arm depicted by predefined time periods and prognostic groups . PCa-specific mortality analyses using Poisson regression in age group 55 - 74 yr at r and omization and separately in the predefined age group of 55 - 69 yr . RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS After a median follow-up of 12.8 yr , 19 765 men ( 94.2 % ) were screened at least once and 2674 PCas were detected ( of which 561 [ 21.0 % ] were interval PCas ) . In the C-arm , 1430 PCas were detected , result ing in an excess incidence of 59 PCas per 1000 men r and omized ( 61 PCas per 1000 in age group 55 - 69 yr ) . Thirty-two percent of all men r and omized have died . PCa-specific mortality relative-risk ( RR ) reductions of 20.0 % overall ( age : 55 - 74 yr ; p = 0.042 ) and 31.6 % ( age : 55 - 69 yr ; p = 0.004 ) were found . A 14.1 % increase was found in men aged 70 - 74 yr ( not statistically significant ) . Absolute PCa mortality was 1.8 per 1000 men r and omized ( 2.6 per 1000 men r and omized in age group 55 - 69 yr ) . The number needed to invite and number needed to manage were 565 and 33 , respectively , for age group 55 - 74 yr , and 392 and 24 , respectively , for age group 65 - 69 yr . Given the slow natural history of the disease , follow-up might be too short . CONCLUSIONS Systematic PSA-based screening reduced PCa-specific mortality by 32 % in the age range of 55 - 69 yr . The roughly twofold higher incidence in the S-arm underlines the importance of tools to better identify those men who would benefit from screening']\",\n          \"[\\\"BACKGROUND There is increased pressure on primary care physicians to monitor oral anticoagulation . OBJECTIVE To test the null hypothesis that oral anticoagulation care can be provided at least as well in primary care through a nurse-led clinic , involving near-patient testing and computerized decision support software , compared with routine hospital management based on a variety of clinical outcome measures . METHODS A r and omized , controlled trial in 12 primary care practice s in Birmingham , Engl and ( 9 intervention and 3 control ) . Two control population s were used :  patients individually r and omly allocated as controls in the intervention practice s ( intra practice controls ) and all patients in control practice s ( inter practice controls ) . Intervention practice s ' patients were r and omized to the intervention ( practice -based anticoagulation clinic ) or control ( hospital clinic ) group . The main outcome measure was therapeutic control of the international normalized ratio . RESULTS Three hundred sixty-seven patients were recruited ( 122 intervention patients , 102 intra practice control patients , and 143 inter practice control patients ) . St and ard measures of control of the international normalized ratio ( point prevalence ) showed no significant difference between the intervention and control groups . Data on proportion of time spent in the international normalized ratio range showed significant improvement for patients in the intervention group ( paired t test , P = .008 ) . CONCLUSIONS Nurse-led anticoagulation clinics can be implemented in novice primary care setting s by means of computerized decision support software and near-patient testing . Care given by this model is at least as good as routine hospital follow-up . The model is generalizable to primary health care centers operating in developed health care systems\\\", 'OBJECTIVE To investigate the effect of meal-related self-monitoring of blood glucose on glycemic control and well-being in non-insulin-treated type 2 diabetic patients . RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS This 6-month study , which included 6 months of follow-up , adopted a prospect i ve , multicenter , r and omized controlled design . Subjects were r and omized to two groups : one group used a blood glucose-monitoring device , kept a blood glucose/eating diary , and received st and ardized counseling ; the control group received nonst and ardized counseling on diet and lifestyle . The primary efficacy parameter was the change in HbA(1c ) . Secondary efficacy variables included changes in body weight , lipids , and microalbumin and changes in treatment satisfaction and well-being . RESULTS In the per- protocol analysis , the use of a self-monitoring blood glucose device significantly reduced HbA(1c ) levels by 1.0 + /- 1.08 % compared with 0.54 + /- 1.41 % for the control group ( P = 0.0086 ) ; subgroup analysis showed three types of responders . Body weight , total cholesterol , and microalbumin improved when using a glucometer , but there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups . Treatment satisfaction increased in both groups to a similar extent ( P = 0.9 ) . Self-monitoring result ed in a marked improvement of general well-being with significant improvements in the subitems depression ( P = 0.032 ) and lack of well-being ( P = 0.02 ) . CONCLUSIONS Meal-related self-monitoring of blood glucose within a structured counseling program improved glycemic control in the majority of non-insulin-treated type 2 diabetic patients in this study . The finding of three types of responders will be important for future planning of counseling and educational interventions', 'Proper r and omisation means little if investigators can not include all r and omised participants in the primary analysis . Participants might ignore follow-up , leave town , or take aspartame when instructed to take aspirin . Exclusions before r and omisation do not bias the treatment comparison , but they can hurt generalisability . Eligibility criteria for a trial should be clear , specific , and applied before r and omisation . Readers should assess whether any of the criteria make the trial sample atypical or unrepresentative of the people in which they are interested . In principle , assessment of exclusions after r and omisation is simple : none are allowed . For the primary analysis , all participants enrolled should be included and analysed as part of the original group assigned ( an intent-to-treat analysis ) . In reality , however , losses frequently occur . Investigators should , therefore , commit adequate re sources to develop and implement procedures to maximise retention of participants . Moreover , research ers should provide clear , explicit information on the progress of all r and omised participants through the trial by use of , for instance , a trial profile . Investigators can also do secondary analyses on , for instance , per- protocol or as-treated participants . Such analyses should be described as secondary and non-r and omised comparisons . Mish and ling of exclusions causes serious method ological difficulties . Unfortunately , some explanations for mish and ling exclusions intuitively appeal to readers , disguising the seriousness of the issues . Creative mismanagement of exclusions can undermine trial validity', \\\"CONTEXT Control of oral anticoagulation therapy has been reported to often be inadequate . Previous retrospective investigations suggest that patients ' self-adjustment of oral anticoagulants may lead to improved control . OBJECTIVE To investigate the effects of patients ' self-management of oral anticoagulation therapy on accuracy of control and measures of treatment-related quality of life . DESIGN R and omized , single-blind , multicenter trial . SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS A total of 179 patients receiving long-term oral anticoagulation treatment were enrolled at 5 referral centers in Germany . INTERVENTION Patients were r and omized to an oral anticoagulation self-management group based on a structured treatment and teaching program and international normalized ratio ( INR ) self-monitoring . The control group received conventional care as provided by family physicians , including referral to specialists if necessary . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Deviation of INR values from the individual INR target range ( squared ) and the 5 categories of treatment-related quality of life . RESULTS Deviation of INR value from the mean of the INR target range was significantly lower in the intervention group at 3-month ( squared INR deviation , 0.59 vs 0.95 ; P<.001 ) and 6-month follow-up ( 0.65 vs 0.83 ; P=.03 ) compared with the control group . Also , the intervention group had INR values within the target range more often ( repeated measurement analysis for categorical data , P=.006 ) . The results were mainly due to less frequent suboptimal INR values in the intervention group ( 32.8 % vs 50.0 % [ P=.03 ] at 3-month , and 33.7 % vs 48.2 % [ P=.08 ] at 6-month follow-up ) . Treatment-related quality -of-life measures , especially treatment satisfaction scores , were significantly higher in the intervention group compared with controls . CONCLUSIONS An anticoagulation education program that includes self-management of anticoagulation therapy results in improved accuracy of anticoagulation control and in treatment-related quality -of-life measures . Further studies are needed to describe whether the program will reduce risk of bleeding or thromboembolism\\\", 'The goal of this study was to compare the relative efficacy and cost of self-monitoring of blood glucose ( SMBG ) with routine urine testing in the management of patients with type II ( non-insulin-dependent ) diabetes mellitus not treated with insulin . Fifty-four patients with type II diabetes mellitus , not treated with insulin , who had inadequate glucose control on diet aloneor diet and oral hypoglycemic agents were studied . Patients performed SMBG or urine glucose testing as part of a st and ardized treatment program that also included diet and exercise counseling . During the 6-mo study , both the urine-testing and SMBG groups showed similar improvement in glycemic control ; within each group , there were significant improvements in fasting plasma glucose ( reduction of 1.4 \\u00b1 3.2 mM , P < 0.03 ) and glycosylated hemoglobin ( reduction of 2.0 \\u00b1 3.4 % , P < 0.01 ) levels . Seventeen ( 31 % ) of54 patients actually normalized their glycosylated hemoglobin values , 9 in the urine-testing group and 8 in the SMBG group . Comparisons between the urine-testing and SMBG groups showed no significant differences in mean fasting plasma glucose ( P > 0.86 ) , glycosylated hemoglobin ( P > 0.95 ) , or weight ( P < 0.19 ) . In patients with type II diabetes mellitus not treated with insulin , SMBG is no more effective , but is 8\\u201312 times more expensive , thanurine testing in facilitating improved glycemic control . Our results do not support widespread use of SMBG in diabetic patients not treated with insulin', 'BACKGROUND Vitamin K antagonist treatment is effective for prevention and treatment of thromboembolic events but frequent laboratory control and dose-adjustment are essential . Small portable devices have enabled patient self-monitoring of anticoagulation and self-adjustment of the dose . We compared this self-management of oral anticoagulant therapy with conventional management by a specialist anticoagulation clinic in a r and omised cross-over study . METHODS 50 patients on long-term oral anticoagulant treatment were included in a r and omised controlled crossover study . Patients were self-managed or were managed by the anticoagulation clinic for a period of 3 months . After this period the alternative strategy was followed for each patient . Prothrombin time ( expressed as international normalised ratio [ INR ] ) were measured at intervals of 1 - 2 weeks in both periods without knowledge of type of management . The primary endpoint was the number of measurements within the therapeutic range ( therapeutic target value + /-50.5 INR units ) . FINDINGS There was no significant difference in the overall quality of control of anticoagulation between the two study periods . Patients were for 55 % and for 49 % of the treatment period within a range of + /-0.5 from the therapeutic target INR during self-management and anticoagulation clinic management , respectively ( p=0.06 ) . The proportion of patients who spent most time in the therapeutic target range was larger during self-management than during anticoagulation clinic-guided management . The odds ratio for a better control of anticoagulation ( defined as the period of time in the therapeutic target range ) during self-management compared with anticoagulation clinic-guided management was 4.6 ( 95 % CI 2.1 - 10.2 ) . A patient-satisfaction assessment showed superiority of self-management over conventional care . INTERPRETATION Self-management of INR in the population in this study is feasible and appears to result in control of anticoagulation that is at least equivalent to management by a specialist anticoagulation clinic . It is also better appreciated by patients . Larger studies are required to assess the effect of this novel management strategy on the incidence of thromboembolic or bleeding complications', 'BACKGROUND Self-management ( SM ) of warfarin by patients is an attractive strategy , particularly if it improves anticoagulation control and can be done safely under minimal physician supervision . OBJECTIVE To compare the effect of SM with physician-management ( PM ) on the maintenance of therapeutic anticoagulation . METHODS A r and omized , open-label eight-month trial was performed . Patients 18 years of age and older were eligible if they were receiving warfarin for at least one month before enrolment and required anticoagulation for at least one year to a target international normalized ratio ( INR ) of 2.0 to 3.0 or 2.5 to 3.5 . Exclusion criteria were a known hypercoaguable disorder , mental incompetence , a language barrier or an inability to attend training sessions . Patients r and omly assigned to SM tested their INR using a point-of-care device ( Pro Time Microcogulation System , International Technidyne Corporation , USA ) and adjusted their warfarin doses using a nomogram . Patients r and omly assigned to PM received usual care from their general practitioner . The primary outcome was to demonstrate 20 % improvement in anticoagulation control by SM . RESULTS One hundred forty patients were r and omly assigned ( 70 per group ) . Thirteen patients dropped out of SM early due to an inability to self-manage . Based on intention-to-treat analysis , there was no difference in the proportion of INR in range ( SM 64.8 % versus PM 58.7 % , P=0.23 ) or time in target range ( SM 71.8 % versus PM 63.2 % , P=0.14 ) . Patients managing their own therapy spent less time below the therapeutic range ( 15.0 % versus 27.3 % , P=0.04 ) . There were three major complications of thrombosis or bleeding , all occurring in the PM arm . All patients who completed SM preferred to continue with that strategy . CONCLUSIONS SM was not significantly better than PM in maintaining therapeutic anticoagulation . SM was feasible and appeared safe in the present study population', \\\"A diabetes protocol characterized by self-monitoring of blood glucose was introduced in four general practice s with the aim of making the frequency of consultations dependent on the metabolic regulation and emphasizing body weight reduction . The feasibility of the programme was investigated and the results after 1 year were compared with those of conventional care in four control practice s. In the experimental practice s , 13 patients switched from a medical specialist 's to a general practitioner 's supervision  , 20 remained under supervision of their GP  and 33 started self-monitoring .  The self-monitoring rate , the consultation frequency according to protocol , the low number of dropouts and inadequate referrals and adherence to the therapeutic scheme showed that the protocol was feasible for both the GPs and the patients . At the initial assessment , the regulation of the diabetes was worse in patients of the experimental group , compared with those of the control group ( mean HbA1 9.7 % vs 8.9 % ; p less than 0.05 ) . On average , patients in the experimental group ( n = 56 ) lost 0.4 kg of body weight , whereas those in the control group ( n = 73 ) gained 0.1 kg ( n.s . ) . The mean change in HbA1 , adjusted for the initial value , was -0.4 % in the experimental and + 0.5 % in the control group ( p less than 0.05 ) . The results of the protocol can be attributed to a combination of greater participation of the patient , the individualized consultation frequency and the prescription of oral hypoglycaemic agents according to body weight development\\\", 'Self-monitoring of blood glucose levels is currently being recommended for obese patients with type II diabetes to improve weight loss and glycemic control . To determine whether self-monitoring of blood glucose levels improves dietary compliance in these patients , 50 obese patients with type II diabetes were r and omly assigned either to a st and ard behavioral weight control program or to a weight control program that included self-monitoring of blood glucose levels and focused on the weight-blood glucose relationship . Both groups lost significant amounts of weight and maintained their losses for at least one year ; reductions in medication could be made for 70 percent of patients . These data suggest that the behavioral weight control used in this study may be of benefit to patients with type II diabetes . However , there was no evidence that the addition of self-monitoring of blood glucose levels to the treatment program improved the outcome in terms of weight loss , reduction in medication , dietary compliance , or mood state', 'The objective of this open , r and omized , multicenter study is to investigate the benefits and economic efficiency of  self-management of oral anticoagulation in patients with atrial fibrillation ( SMAAF study ) in comparison with a group of patients given conventional care by a general practitioner or specialist . Two thous and patients suitable for self-management will be assigned at r and om to either the self-management group or the control group . The numbers of thromboembolic and hemorrhagic complications requiring treatment during the 2-year follow-up period will be recorded as the primary end point . The secondary endpoint variables will be maintenance of the INR value in the individual target range , INR variance , the course of complications over time , and the cost efficiency of self-management compared with the routine procedures . The last of these parameters will include the diagnostic and /or therapeutic measures carried out , the duration of inpatient hospital treatment , and the social consequences ( subsequent rehabilitation treatment , inability to work , forced retirement ) . The estimate of the required number of patients was based on the assumption that during long-term anticoagulant therapy within the framework of primary and secondary prevention 4 % of patients with chronic non-valvular atrial fibrillation would have severe thromboembolic of hemorrhagic complications each year . Since this rate can be halved by self-management , a one-tailed chi 2-test of 80 % power and a 5 % significance threshold would require n = 997 patients per group . The results of the SMAAF study will establish the socioeconomic benefits of self-management in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation', 'BACKGROUND Severe thromboembolic and hemorrhagic complications after mechanical heart valve replacement essentially depend on the intensity of oral anticoagulation and the fluctuation of individual international normalized ratio ( INR ) values . METHODS After heart valve replacement with Medtronic Hall , St. Jude Medical , and CarboMedics implants , patients were r and omly divided into two groups , one controlling INR values at home , the other being monitored by family practitioners . RESULTS Almost 80 % of the INR values recorded by patients at home were within the stipulated therapeutic range , INR 2.5 to 4.5 , compared with just 62 % of INR values recorded by family practitioners . The overall complication rate ( hemorrhages and thromboembolic events ) of the self-management group was significantly ( p < 0.05 ) decreased compared with the conventional group . CONCLUSIONS Through INR self-management , an improvement in the quality of ongoing oral anticoagulation could be shown . Starting this form of therapeutic control early after mechanical heart valve replacement appears to effect a further reduction in anticoagulant-induced complications', 'BACKGROUND Several studies have demonstrated that patient self-management of oral anticoagulant therapy ( OAT )  can improve treatment quality . However , most of these studies were not conducted within a specialized anticoagulation care system . The objective of the present study was to determine whether patient self-management of OAT improves the quality of care delivered by anticoagulation clinics . METHODS In this r and omized study by 2 Dutch anticoagulation clinics 341 patients aged between 18 and 75 years and receiving long-term OAT were divided into 4 groups : an existing routine care group of patients untrained in self-management ; a routine care group of trained patients ; a group managed weekly at an anticoagulation clinic where international normalized ratios were measured by trained patients ; and weekly patient self-management . A 2-step r and omization procedure was followed : first , a Zelen- design r and omization was performed to distribute patients ( without informing them ) to the existing care group or to receive training in self-management ; second , trained patients were r and omized to the 3 other study groups . RESULTS Only 25.6 % of invited patients agreed to participate in the training program . Patients who remained in the existing care group were within the international normalized ratio target range 63.5 % of the time . The type of coumarin taken was a major predicting factor of OAT quality . In all study groups phenprocoumon outperformed acenocoumarol by 11.6 % ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 6.6%-16.5 % ) . Weekly management with phenprocoumon led to a 6.5 % improvement ( 95 % CI , 0.0%-13.1 % ) in time in the international normalized ratio target range when patients were managed at an anticoagulation clinic and to an 8.7 % improvement ( 95 % CI , 1.6%-15.9 % ) when patients were self-managed . Weekly management with acenocoumarol did not improve the quality of OAT . CONCLUSION With selected patients , the quality of OAT obtained through patient self-management is at least as high as that delivered by specialized physicians at anticoagulation clinics . Weekly management of OAT with long-acting phenprocoumon has to be preferred at anticoagulation clinics or , where possible , through patient self-management', 'To study if self-monitoring of glucose , urinary or capillary , could help them to improve their metabolic control through better compliance to diet and /or hypoglycaemic agents , 208 non-insulin-treated poorly controlled diabetic patients were r and omized to : group A -- regular HbA1c determinations but no self-monitoring , group B -- self-urine glucose monitoring , twice every other day , group C -- self blood glucose monitoring , twice every other day , and followed six months . At the end of the study period , the decrease of HbA1c over six months -- main endpoint -- was not significantly different between the three groups ( mean + /- SEM ; group A : -0.5 + /- 0.2 % ; group B : -0.1 + /- 0.3 % ; group C : -0.4 + /- 0.3 % ) . However , the degree of compliance to  blood glucose self-monitoring  in group C appeared to relate to the outcome : a significant correlation was found between the number of blood glucose strips used and the decrease of HbA1c ( r = .36 , p less than .02 ) . We conclude that regular self-monitoring has no definite advantage over the usual management for improving metabolic control in non-insulin-treated diabetic patients , though it may possibly help patients ready to comply with its use', 'Self-monitoring of blood glucose  ( SBGM ) is widely recommended for both type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients despite the lack of evidence of benefit in glucose control or as an aid in weight loss in type 2 subjects . This study tested the hypothesis that combined use of SMBG and dietary carbohydrate ( CHO ) counting , using the blood monitoring results to shape dietary CHO quotas , is beneficial in managing type 2 diabetes . Twenty-three over-weight ( body mass index , BMI 27.5\\u201344 kg/m2 ) patients aged 40\\u201375 participated in a 28-week behavioral weight control program . Baseline hemoglobin HbA 1c ranged between 9.5 % and 13.5 % ( normal range 5.5%\\u20137.7 % ) . Subjects were matched for weight , sex , and HbAlc and assigned to small ( 4\\u20138 participants ) groups which met weekly for 12 weeks and then monthly for 16 weeks . After 8 weeks , the group were r and omized either to continue the behavioral program or to have SMBG and dietary CHO counting .  Glucose monitoring was performed 6 times daily ( pre- and 2h postpr and ially ) for the first month , focusing on the meal increment and correlating this to dietary CHO intake . Weight loss was identical in both groups during the year of follow-up . The HbA1c level showed a progressive decline in experimental subjects ( P<0.05 ) , whereas there was no improvement in control subjects', 'Abstract Objective To determine the clinical effectiveness of self management compared with routine care in patients on long term oral anticoagulants . Design Multicentre open r and omised controlled trial . Setting Midl and s region of the UK . Participants 617 patients aged over 18 and receiving warfarin r and omised to intervention ( n = 337 ) and routine care ( n = from 2470 invited ; 193/337 ( 57 % ) completed the 12 month intervention . Intervention Intervention patients used a point of care device to measure international normalised ratio twice a week and a simple dosing chart to interpret their dose of warfarin . Main outcome measure Percentage of time spent within the therapeutic range of international normalised ratio . Results No significant differences were found in percentage of time in the therapeutic range between self managment and routine care ( 70 % v 68 % ) . Self managed patients with poor control before the study showed an improvement in control that was not seen in the routine care group . Nine patients ( 2.8/100 patient years ) had serious adverse events in the self managed group , compared with seven ( 2.7/100 patient years ) in the routine care arm ( \\u03c72(df = 1 ) = 0.02 , P = 0.89 ) . Conclusion With appropriate training , self management is safe and reliable for a sizeable proportion of patients receiving oral anticoagulation treatment . It may improve the time spent the therapeutic range for patients with initially poor control . Trial registration IS RCT N 19313375', 'This study tested the hypothesis that follow-up intervention ( by telephone calls and home visit ) affects compliance in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus ( NIDDM ) . Sixty NIDDM patients were r and omly assigned to two groups \\u2014 a control group , which received the st and ard protocol ( 3-day educational program and a review session 1 month after the program ) ; and an intervention group , which received the st and ard protocol as well as a series offour telephone calls and one home visit by a registered nurse over a 3-month period .  Compliance to prescribed regimens was determined by analyzing three sets of data : changes in pre- to post study glycosylated hemoglobin ( HbA1c ) values ; changes in pre- to post study weight ; and frequency with which self-monitoring of blood glucose ( SMBG ) was practice d. Results showed that SMBG practice was significantly better for the intervention group . No significant differences were seen in post study HbA 1c values and weight changes between the two groups . Follow-up inter vention by telephone calls and home visit can enhance patient compliance to certain aspects of the prescribed diabetes management plan', 'STUDY OBJECTIVE To evaluate the efficacy and accuracy of monitoring prothrombin times at home . DESIGN R and omized , prospect i ve cohort study . SETTING Out patients discharged from a university hospital or a community hospital . PATIENTS Fifty patients started on warfarin for the first time who demonstrated an ability to use the monitor and who had not achieved a stable response to warfarin in the hospital . INTERVENTION Oral anticoagulation therapy managed using a portable prothrombin time monitor compared with specialized anticoagulation clinic care . MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS In the 46 patients who completed the 8-week study , the median percentage of time that patients in the home-monitor group ( n = 23 ) were within a range equal to the target prothrombin ratio + /- 0.3 , but always above 1.25 , was 93 % , compared with 75 % for patients in the clinic group ( n = 23 ) ( P = 0.003 ) . There was no significant difference between groups in the percentage of time above the therapeutic range ; however , the percentage of time that patients were subtherapeutic was significantly greater in the clinic group ( P less than 0.001 ) . There were no major thromboembolic or hemorrhagic complications in either group . Differences between home monitor measurements and corresponding clinical laboratory measurements using blood sample s drawn within 4 hours of the home test were comparable to differences observed between measurements using two different clinical laboratory instruments . CONCLUSIONS Use of a portable prothrombin time monitor by patients at home is feasible and provides accurate measurements . Patients doing home monitoring achieve superior anticoagulation control compared with those receiving st and ard anticoagulation clinic care', \\\"Context Although many out patients require oral anticoagulation , the optimal management of outpatient anticoagulation remains uncertain . Studies have demonstrated the feasibility of patient self-management using portable coagulometers , but the studies that compared patient outcomes with self-management and those with conventional management in an anticoagulation clinic did not find a better outcome with self-management . Contribution In this r and omized , controlled trial of 737 patients , patients assigned to self-management of anticoagulation achieved a similar level of control and had fewer adverse events than patients assigned to conventional management . Implication s Health care providers should begin to implement patient self-management of oral anticoagulation with portable coagulometers in mainstream practice . The Editors Indications for oral anticoagulant treatment to prevent thromboembolic disease have increased in recent years ( 1 ) . Prothrombin times must be monitored frequently in patients taking oral anticoagulants to determine the safest dose and to minimize the risk for complications . The clinical management of oral anticoagulant treatment improved greatly after the international normalized ratio ( INR ) was introduced as a measurement of anticoagulation intensity ( 1 ) . The establishment of accurate therapeutic INR ranges was also beneficial . Target ranges include the safest INR values that carry the lowest risk for hemorrhagic or thromboembolic complications ( 2 ) . Despite these improvements , however , serious complications are still associated with oral anticoagulant treatment ( 3 , 4 ) , and management by specialized staff at anticoagulation clinics seems to be safer than other clinical strategies in terms of numbers of complications ( 5 - 7 ) . Currently , portable coagulometers are available for determining INR easily and reliably ( 8) . This technology provides interesting clinical models for the control of oral anticoagulant treatment , the most promising of which are patient self-testing and patient self-management . For patient self-testing , patients measure INRs themselves and ask their referring physicians for the proper anticoagulant dose . Patient self-management assumes that patients will adjust their own doses and is the most autonomous strategy . Several published studies have compared these strategies with usual care ( that is , monitoring of oral anticoagulant treatment by practitioners ) ( 9 - 13 ) or with specialized anticoagulation clinics ( 14 - 18 ) . Although these studies showed that both patient self-testing and patient self-management are feasible , their sample s were relatively small ( 9 , 11 , 13 , 14 - 18 ) or included selected patients with mechanical valve prostheses ( 10 ) or patients older than 65 years of age ( 12 ) . In general , previous studies indicate that patient self-management may be superior to management by general practitioners or anticoagulation clinics in quality of INR control ( 10 - 18 ) . In addition , Krtke and Krfer ( 10 ) , Beyth and associates ( 12 ) , and Sawicki ( 13 ) reported a decrease in major complications among self-managed patients compared with patients managed by general practitioners . To date , no published data have suggested a better clinical outcome ( decrease in associated complications ) with patient self-management than with specialized management at an anticoagulation clinic ( 5 , 19 ) . We performed a r and omized , controlled trial to directly compare self-management of oral anticoagulant treatment , as evaluated in terms of efficacy and safety in unselected patients , with management in an anticoagulation clinic . Methods Study Design The Alternative Control of Oral Anticoagulant Treatment ( ACOA ) trial is a single-center , central ly r and omized , controlled study that was performed at Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau , Barcelona , Spain , from January 2001 to July 2002 . The hematologists who manage our anticoagulation clinic use a homogeneous dosing protocol and st and ard protocol s to manage situations that increase clinical risk . The clinical staff includes trained nurses . Computers control the clinical data and INR records , ensuring excellent follow-up . Patients and their relatives receive basic education at the beginning of oral anticoagulant treatment , including information on the main characteristics of oral anticoagulants , potential risks , rationale for periodic monitoring , and drug interactions . Samsa and Matchar ( 20 ) recommended that these characteristics be used to provide an appropriate control group in a trial on patient self-management . The institutional review board of our hospital approved the study . Recruitment Phase The recruitment phase began with computerized r and om selection of 1500 patients from the more than 5000 who were receiving oral anticoagulant treatment controlled in our hospital . We included any ambulatory patient 18 years of age or older who had been receiving long-term anticoagulant therapy for at least 3 months before entering the study . We excluded patients who were younger than 18 years of age , who had a severe physical or mental illness without a responsible caregiver , or who were of foreign origin and were unable to underst and Spanish . Once the patient ( or his or her caregiver ) agreed to participate , written informed consent was obtained . Next , central ized telephone r and omization assigned the patient to the experimental group ( patient self-management ) or to the control group ( conventional management ) . The allocation sequence was generated at the hospital 's epidemiology department , and the sequence of r and omization was concealed until the patient was assigned to a group . To facilitate comparability between study groups , this r and omization was stratified according to sex , age ( 70 years of age or < 70 years of age ) , and indication for oral anticoagulant treatment ( 4 groups ) . Members of our anticoagulation clinic enrolled participants and assigned them to groups . Baseline data included demographic details , clinical information on associated risk factors , other medications , previous length of anticoagulant therapy , bleeding or thromboembolic complications during oral anticoagulant treatment , and target INR range . Follow-up for patients assigned to the conventional management group was done immediately . Patients in the self-management group received a training course first , and follow-up was not performed until the nurse teaching the course judged that the patients had acquired a minimum of expertise in self-management . Training Course An educational program was design ed to optimize the number of patients able to underst and and safely perform  self-management  ( Appendix ) . It was similar to the German program developed by Sawicki ( 13 ) but was demographically adapted to the characteristics of the Spanish population , considering differences in daily schedules , diet , educational level , and other idiosyncratic factors . The program consisted of 2 sessions of 2 hours each on consecutive days . A specially trained nurse was responsible for teaching the patients in small , organized groups . The lessons included basic theoretical and practical concepts involving the use of a coagulometer , interpretation of INR , and adjustment of dose . The concepts of target range and dose modification were emphasized when necessary . A simple card system was design ed to help the patient select the correct dose . For each target range , a specific card was provided . Patients were taught to use the portable coagulometer CoaguChek S ( Roche Diagnostics , Mannheim , Germany ) with the appropriate reagent strips . Follow-up Phase Normally , the patients in the conventional management group visited our hospital every 4 weeks to check their INRs . When the INR result was out of target range , our dosing protocol indicated that we should advance the next appointment for INR testing to 1 or 2 weeks . International normalized ratio was determined by means of a st and ard KC 10 coagulometer ( Amelung , Lemgo , Germany ) . As a thromboplastin , we used Thromborel S ( Behring , Marburg , Germany ) . A hematologist experienced in oral anticoagulation management adjusted the dose and made the appointment for the next INR test . Patients in the self-management group performed the INR tests at home once per week using the CoaguChek S kit . They determined the appropriate dose of oral anticoagulant and the time of the next INR test . All of the INR results in both groups were entered into a computer ( in the central system of our anticoagulation clinic or in the portable coagulometers ) to facilitate data management . Patients in both groups were interviewed monthly by telephone to record any complications or changes in their health status . For the conventional management group , these interviews were done approximately midway between hospital visits . The questions addressed minor or major bleeding , thromboembolic events , episodic diseases , changes in long-term medications , and hospital stays . Associated complications were diagnosed and evaluated by a third physician who was not involved in the trial and was unaware of patients ' study group . St and ard criteria were used to diagnose any thromboembolic complications . Transient ischemic attack was diagnosed clinical ly by a neurologist , and superficial thrombophlebitis was diagnosed clinical ly by an angiologist . To diagnose stroke , arterial embolism , venous thromboembolism , pulmonary embolism , or valve thrombosis , we used widely accepted methods ( computed tomography or magnetic nuclear resonance imaging , angiography , surgical diagnosis , Doppler ultrasonography , phlebography , lung angiography or ventilation-perfusion lung scanning , cardiac ultrasonography , or fluoroscopy ) . All thromboembolic complications were considered major events . Life-threatening bleeding or bleeding requiring transfusion or hospital admission was considered a major event . Any other bleeding was considered a minor event . Statistical Analysis Study outcomes were evaluated on an intention-to-treat basis and also on an on-treatment basis .\\\", 'Of 125 patients aged 65 years or over , with atrial fibrillation taking warfarin for at least 12 months , with a st and ard deviation ( SD ) of prothrombin time , expressed as the International Normalized Ratio ( INR ) > 0\\u00b75 over the previous 6 months , 40 were r and omized to continue with usual clinic care and 85 to receive education about warfarin .  Of these , 44 were r and omized to self\\u2010monitor their INR and 41 returned to clinic . Compared with the previous 6 months there was a significant increase in percentage time within the therapeutic range for the 6 months following education [ 61\\u00b71 vs. 70\\u00b74 ; mean difference 8\\u00b78 ; 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) : \\u22120\\u00b72\\u201317\\u00b78 ; P = 0\\u00b7054 ] and following education and self\\u2010monitoring ( 57 vs. 71\\u00b71 ; mean difference 14\\u00b71 ; 95 % CI : 6\\u00b77\\u201321\\u00b75 ; P < 0\\u00b7001 ) , compared with those patients following usual clinic care ( 60\\u00b70 vs. 63\\u00b72 ; mean difference 3\\u00b72 ; 95 % CI : \\u22127\\u00b73\\u201313\\u00b77 ) . Using the same comparative periods , the INR SD fell by 0\\u00b724 ( P < 0\\u00b70001 ) in the group allocated to education and self\\u2010monitoring , 0\\u00b726 ( P < 0\\u00b70001 ) in the group receiving education alone and 0\\u00b716 ( P = 0\\u00b7003 ) in the control group . Inter\\u2010group differences were not statistically significant ( intervention groups 0\\u00b726 \\u00b1 0\\u00b730 vs. control 0\\u00b716 \\u00b1 0\\u00b73 , P = 0\\u00b710 ) . Quality \\u2010of\\u2010life measurements and health beliefs about warfarin were unchanged ( apart from emotional role limitation ) with education or education and self\\u2010monitoring .  Patient  education regarding anticoagulation therapy could be a cost\\u2010effective initiative and is worthy of further study', 'BACKGROUND This study was conducted to assess the ability of patients receiving heart valve replacements to practice self-managed anticoagulation using a portable coagulometer . METHODS We carried out a prospect i ve , r and omized trial , comparing self-managed anticoagulation with conventional management .  Patients practicing self-managed anticoagulation ( 51 patients ) did so at home , measuring their international normalized ratio and then deciding on their dosage of warfarin , while  conventionally controlled patients ( n = 49 ) attended hospital clinics or were managed by their family physicians . RESULTS We successfully trained 41 of 44 patients who agreed to self-manage their anticoagulant therapy ; 34 of the 41 managed their own anticoagulation at home for 2 years . Their control , assessed by a number of tests in range ( 67.6 % versus 58.0 % ) and time in therapeutic range ( 76.5 % versus 63.8 % ) , was significantly better than that for the group managed conventionally ( p < 0.0001 ) . There was no significant difference in mortality or morbidity between the two groups . CONCLUSIONS Self-managed anticoagulation is a reliable , easily learned method of controlling anticoagulation , and it is suitable for approximately two thirds of patients , with excellent results', \\\"Bleeding is the major side effect of warfarin and is a major deterrent to its use , especially in older patients . Older people are widely thought to be at increased risk for warfarin-related bleeding ( 1 - 8 ) , and they are less likely to be treated with warfarin , even when it has been proven efficacious , in part because of concern about risk for bleeding ( 9 - 13 ) . Efforts that reduce the frequency of major warfarin-related bleeding not only will increase the net benefit of therapy but also will facilitate more appropriate and widespread use of warfarin therapy in older patients . Methods for identifying patients at highest risk for bleeding have recently advanced ( 5 - 7 , 14 - 21 ) , and experience with specialized programs that coordinate the management of anticoagulant therapy suggests that clinical outcomes may be improved ( 6 , 14 , 18 , 22 - 27 ) . However , there is little controlled or experimental evidence on how to optimize management of anticoagulant therapy in older patients and prevent bleeding . We developed a multicomponent comprehensive program for management of warfarin therapy aim ed at improving control of the anticoagulant effect and reducing events ( such as use of an interacting medicine ) that might precipitate bleeding . We hypothesized that this intervention would be acceptable to most elderly persons starting warfarin therapy and would reduce the frequency of warfarin-related major bleeding . Methods Patients Patients hospitalized at University Hospitals of Clevel and , a 900-bed teaching hospital , between September 1992 and October 1995 who were 65 years of age or older and were receiving 10 000 units or more of intravenous unfractionated heparin every 24 hours were screened daily . Of these patients , we identified 426 persons who were 65 years of age or older , who resided in Cuyahoga County , Ohio , and for whom treatment with warfarin was planned for 10 or more days ( Figure 1 ) . Patients were excluded if they had been treated with warfarin at any time during the previous 6 months , were admitted from a nursing home , were enrolled in another clinical trial , were too ill to give consent and had no available surrogate , were discharged prematurely , or did not speak English ; if their private physician refused to participate ; or if no r and om allocation was taking place ( for example , during vacations or holidays ) . Eligible patients who were enrolled did not differ significantly from those who were not enrolled with regard to age , ethnicity , sex , or indication for therapy . Figure 1 . Eligibility and r and om assignment of patients . Patients were stratified according to their baseline risk for major bleeding by using the Outpatient Bleeding Risk Index ( 20 ) . This index includes four independent risk factors for  major bleeding :  age 65 years or older , history of gastrointestinal bleeding , history of stroke , and one or more of four specific comorbid conditions ( recent myocardial infa rct ion , hematocrit<30 % , creatinine concentration>133 mol/L [ 1.5 mg/dL ] , or diabetes mellitus ) . Patients with one or two risk factors were classified as intermediate risk , and those with three or more risk factors were classified as high risk ; estimated frequencies of major bleeding in 6 months were 6 % and 35 % , respectively . After stratification , patients were r and omly assigned to receive usual care or intervention . Informed consent for observation and data collection was then sought from both groups , and informed consent to participate in the intervention was sought from the intervention group . This method , initially proposed by Zelen ( 28 ) , allows the study to test the effectiveness of offering the intervention rather than simply the efficacy of the intervention in patients who consent to participation before r and om assignment . The sample size was calculated to provide 80 % power and an level of 0.05 . The study protocol and informed consent procedures were approved by the hospital 's institutional review board . Intervention The intervention had two main components . The first component consisted of a guideline -based consultation that assessed the patient 's indications for therapy and potential risk factors for warfarin-related bleeding .  We used this method previously to reduce the frequency of anticoagulant-related bleeding  during hospitalization ( 27 ) . Specific recommendations about modifiable risk factors , such as use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs , were made and implemented . The study investigators directed warfarin dosing and international normalized ratio ( INR ) testing after hospital discharge . The second component included patient education , coaching , and self-monitoring of prothrombin time ;  this component was grounded in social learning theory ( 29 - 31 ) and experimental evidence ( 32 , 33 ) showing that increasing participation of patients in their care can improve clinical outcomes but that increasing patient knowledge alone is insufficient ( 34 , 35 ) . Patient education consisted of one-on-one teaching by a lay educator using a specifically formatted workbook for older adults to teach them about warfarin , indications for its use , drug and food interactions , and the signs and symptoms of bleeding . The lay educator review ed the workbook and was taught how to use the prothrombin time monitor by one of the authors but had no formal medical training . Coaching was aim ed to increase patients ' participation in their care and to improve information-seeking skills . Patients were trained and encouraged to communicate more effectively with physicians and other health personnel about a range of issues , such as health concerns , drug interactions , or changes in lifestyle or diet . Finally , patients were taught to self-monitor the  prothrombin time by using a home portable monitor ( Coumatrak Protime Test System , Biotrack , Inc. , Mountain View , California ) . The monitor uses a fingerstick to obtain a blood sample and has well-established accuracy ( 36 - 38 ) . Patients were initially assessed , educated , and taught to use the portable monitor while hospitalized ; training lasted 30 minutes to 1 hour . They were seen daily while hospitalized , warfarin therapy was adjusted as needed , and any concerns or questions about anticoagulant therapy were addressed . Within 3 days of discharge from the hospital , the lay educator or study investigator made a home visit to assess patients ' use of the portable monitor and to check the  prothrombin time .  In general , patients were instructed to check their prothrombin time three times during the first week after hospital discharge , weekly for the remainder of the first month , and monthly thereafter depending on their results . Patients phoned in their results to the coach , who review ed the results with one of the investigators and provided same-day follow-up , including recommendations for dose and subsequent INR testing . Patients were instructed to call whenever they had questions or concerns about their  warfarin management or possible side effects , if they were hospitalized for any reason , or if they began receiving new medications . After the 6-month intervention period , management and dosing of warfarin therapy reverted back to patients ' personal physicians . Patients assigned to usual care received medical care , including management , dosing , and medical information , according to the discretion and practice s of their personal physician . Data Collection Trained abstract ors who were not involved with the intervention component of the study collected data from the medical chart at the start of anticoagulant therapy ; at each subsequent hospitalization ; and by blinded interview at enrollment and 1 , 3 , and 6 months after enrollment and every 6 months thereafter . Data elements included demographic characteristics , clinical history including comorbid diagnoses , indications for therapy , potential risk factors for bleeding , functional status , and new illnesses or comorbid conditions that developed after enrollment . Surveillance for bleeding and thromboembolism was conducted identically in the intervention and control groups and consisted of 12 items inquiring about bleeding and thromboembolism at each follow-up interview . Whenever an event was reported , the clinical characteristics of the bleeding or thromboembolic episode were determined by review of the relevant medical record and abstract ed without identifying patient information onto a st and ard form . All date s of death were confirmed by death certificates , and all causes of death were confirmed by review of death certificates and medical records . Follow-up was complete for all patients . End Points The primary end point was the first major bleeding event during the 6-month intervention period . Using explicit criteria in the Bleeding Severity Index ( 39 ) for the amount , rate , and consequences of bleeding , we defined major bleeding as overt bleeding that led to the loss of at least 2.0 units of blood in 7 days or less or was otherwise life-threatening ( for example , intracranial bleeding ) . Bleeding was classified without information about possible risk factors or r and omization status . Two author- review ers who were blinded to group assignment adjudicated bleeding events ; their agreement was high ( statistic , 0.97 ) . Secondary outcomes were death and recurrent venous thromboembolism at 6 months ; major bleeding after 6 months ; and control of anticoagulant therapy during the first 6 months of therapy , as measured by the INR . The therapeutic range of the INR was defined as 2.5 to 3.5 for persons with mechanical heart valves and 2.0 to 3.0 for persons with all other indications ( 40 ) . Therapeutic quality control was assessed by using the patient-time approach , described by Rosendaal and colleagues ( 41 ) , for three time periods after discharge from the hospital : 0 to 1 month , 1 to 3 months , and 3 to 6 months of therapy . This approach estimates the amount of time a patient is in the therapeutic range based on the actual INRs measured , assuming a linear relationship between consecutive INRs . Patients with only one\\\", \\\"An ageing population and the continuing expansion of clinical indications for coumadin therapy have increased pressure on hospital anticoagulant clinics . One solution is patient self\\u2010testing ( PST ) of the international normalized ratio ( INR ) using capillary blood sample s on point\\u2010of\\u2010care coagulation monitors at home . We conducted a prospect i ve study to determine whether patients can achieve accurate INR values through PST , using the CoaguChek S ( Roche Diagnostics , Lewes , UK ) . The main outcome measurements were : comparability of INR values obtained by PST and the hospital laboratory , patient acceptability as assessed by a question naire and anticoagulant control . Eighty\\u2010four patients [ 53 men , 31 women ; median age 59 years ( range 26\\u201383 ) ] , receiving long\\u2010term oral anticoagulation ( warfarin ) , were recruited from our Anticoagulation Clinic . Patients were r and omized to weekly self\\u2010testing or continuing 4\\u2010weekly hospital laboratory monitoring of INR . Comparison of INRs ( n = 234 ) showed no significant differences between the CoaguChek ( median INR 3\\u00b702 ) and laboratory testing ( median INR 3\\u00b707 ) . There was excellent correlation between the two methods ( r = 0\\u00b795 ) , with 85 % of CoaguChek results within 0\\u00b75 INR units of the laboratory method . On four occasions , differences of > 1 unit INR were obtained , but in each case the patient 's anticoagulation was unstable ( INR > 4\\u00b75 by both methods ) and the differences in INR would not have altered patient management . 87 % of patients found self\\u2010testing straightforward , 87 % were confident in the result they obtained and 77 % preferred self\\u2010testing .

Treating actinic keratoses and the surrounding skin area ( i.e. , field therapy ) can eradicate clinical and sub clinical actinic keratoses . Topical field therapy currently requires weeks or months of treatment . We investigated the efficacy and safety of a new topical field therapy for actinic keratosis , ingenol mebutate gel ( 0.015 % for face and scalp and 0.05 % for trunk and extremities ) . METHODS In four multicenter , r and omized , double-blind studies , we r and omly assigned patients with actinic keratoses on the face or scalp or on the trunk or extremities to receive ingenol mebutate or placebo ( vehicle ) , self-applied to a 25-cm(2 ) contiguous field once daily for 3 consecutive days for lesions on the face or scalp or for 2 consecutive days for the trunk or extremities . Complete clearance ( primary outcome ) was assessed at 57 days , and local reactions were quantitatively measured . RESULTS In a pooled analysis of the two trials involving the face and scalp , the rate of complete clearance was higher with ingenol mebutate than with placebo ( 42.2 % vs. 3.7 % , P<0.001 ) . Local reactions peaked at day 4 , with a mean maximum composite score of 9.1 on the local-skin-response scale ( which ranges from 0 to 4 for six types of reaction , yielding a composite score of 0 to 24 , with higher numbers indicating more severe reactions ) , rapidly decreased by day 8 , and continued to decrease , approaching baseline scores by day 29 . In a pooled analysis of the two trials involving the trunk and extremities , the rate of complete clearance was also higher with ingenol mebutate than with placebo ( 34.1 % vs. 4.7 % , P<0.001 ) . Local skin reactions peaked between days 3 and 8 and declined rapidly , approaching baseline by day 29 , with a mean maximum score of 6.8 . Adverse events were generally mild to moderate in intensity and resolved without sequelae .

However , the duration of the benefit is unknown , as are the effects specific to age and sex . METHODS In the Minnesota Colon Cancer Control Study , 46,551 participants , 50 to 80 years of age , were r and omly assigned to usual care ( control ) or to annual or biennial screening with fecal occult-blood testing . Screening was performed from 1976 through 1982 and from 1986 through 1992 . We used the National Death Index to obtain up date d information on the vital status of participants and to determine causes of death through 2008 . RESULTS Through 30 years of follow-up , 33,020 participants ( 70.9 % ) died . A total of 732 deaths were attributed to colorectal cancer : 200 of the 11,072 deaths ( 1.8 % ) in the annual-screening group , 237 of the 11,004 deaths ( 2.2 % ) in the biennial-screening group , and 295 of the 10,944 deaths ( 2.7 % ) in the control group . Screening reduced colorectal-cancer mortality ( relative risk with annual screening , 0.68 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.56 to 0.82 ; relative risk with biennial screening , 0.78 ; 95 % CI , 0.65 to 0.93 ) through 30 years of follow-up . No reduction was observed in all-cause mortality ( relative risk with annual screening , 1.00 ; 95 % CI , 0.99 to 1.01 ; relative risk with biennial screening , 0.99 ; 95 % CI , 0.98 to 1.01 ) . The reduction in colorectal-cancer mortality was larger for men than for women in the biennial-screening group ( P=0.04 for interaction ) . CONCLUSIONS The effect of screening with fecal occult-blood testing on colorectal-cancer mortality persists after 30 years but does not influence all-cause mortality .

We assessed their effects on mortality and breastfeeding rates  in rural Malawi . METHODS We did a 2 \\u00d7 2 factorial , cluster-r and omised trial in 185,888 people in Mchinji district . 48 equal-sized clusters were r and omly allocated to four groups with a computer-generated number sequence . 24 facilitators guided groups through a community action cycle to tackle maternal and child health problems . 72 trained volunteer peer counsellors  made home visits at five timepoints during pregnancy and after birth to support breastfeeding and infant care . Primary outcomes for the women 's group intervention were maternal , perinatal , neonatal , and infant mortality rates ( MMR , PMR , NMR , and IMR , respectively ) ; and for the peer counselling were IMR and exclusive breastfeeding ( EBF ) rates . Analysis was by intention to treat . The trial is registered as IS RCT N06477126 . FINDINGS We monitored outcomes of 26,262 births between 2005 and 2009 . In a factorial model adjusted only for clustering and the volunteer peer counselling intervention , in women 's group areas , for years 2 and 3 , we noted non-significant decreases in NMR ( odds ratio 0.93 , 0.64 - 1.35 ) and MMR ( 0.54 , 0.28 - 1.04 ) . After adjustment for parity , socioeconomic quintile , and baseline measures , effects were larger for NMR ( 0.85 , 0.59 - 1.22 ) and MMR ( 0.48 , 0.26 - 0.91 ) . Because of the interaction between the two interventions , a stratified analysis was done . For women 's groups , in adjusted analyses , MMR fell by 74 % ( 0.26 , 0.10 - 0.70 ) , and NMR by 41 % ( 0.59 , 0.40 - 0.86 ) in areas with no peer counsellors , but there was no effect in areas with counsellors ( 1.09 , 0.40 - 2.98 , and 1.38 , 0.75 - 2.54 ) . Factorial analysis for the peer counselling intervention for years 1 - 3 showed a fall in IMR of 18 % ( 0.82 , 0.67 - 1.00 ) and an improvement in EBF rates ( 2.42 , 1.48 - 3.96 ) . The results of the stratified , adjusted analysis showed a 36 % reduction in IMR ( 0.64 , 0.48 - 0.85 ) but no effect on EBF ( 1.18 , 0.63 - 2.25 ) in areas without women 's groups , and in areas with women 's groups there was no effect on IMR ( 1.05 , 0.82 - 1.36 ) and an increase in EBF ( 5.02 , 2.67 - 9.44 ) . The cost of women 's groups was US$ 114 per year of life lost ( YLL ) averted and that of peer counsellors was $ 33 per YLL averted , using stratified data from single intervention comparisons .

FUNDING Saving Newborn Lives , UK Department for International Development , and Wellcome Trust\\\", 'BACKGROUND Venous thromboembolism is a common , potentially avoidable cause of death and morbidity in patients in hospital , including those with stroke . In surgical patients , intermittent pneumatic compression ( IPC ) reduces the risk of deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ) , but no reliable evidence exists about its effectiveness in patients who have had a stroke . We assessed the effectiveness of IPC to reduce the risk of DVT in patients who have had a stroke . METHODS The CLOTS 3 trial is a multicentre parallel group r and omised trial assessing IPC in immobile patients ( ie , who can not walk to the toilet without the help of another person ) with acute stroke . We enrolled patients from day 0 to day 3 of admission and allocated them via a central r and omisation system ( ratio 1:1 ) to receive either IPC or no IPC . A technician who was masked to treatment allocation did a compression duplex ultrasound ( CDU ) of both legs at 7 - 10 days and , wherever practical , at 25 - 30 days after enrolment . Caregivers and patients were not masked to treatment assignment . Patients were followed up for 6 months to determine survival and later symptomatic venous thromboembolism . The primary outcome was a DVT in the proximal veins detected on a screening CDU or any symptomatic DVT in the proximal veins , confirmed on imaging , within 30 days of r and omisation . Patients were analysed according to their treatment allocation . TRIAL REGISTRATION IS RCT N93529999 . FINDINGS Between Dec 8 , 2008 , and Sept 6 , 2012 , 2876 patients were enrolled in 94 centres in the UK . The included patients were broadly representative of immobile stroke patients admitted to hospital and had a median age of 76 years ( IQR 67 - 84 ) . The primary outcome occurred in 122 ( 8\\u00b75 % ) of 1438 patients allocated IPC and 174 ( 12\\u00b71 % ) of 1438 patients allocated no IPC ; an absolute reduction in risk of 3\\u00b76 % ( 95 % CI 1\\u00b74 - 5\\u00b78 ) . Excluding the 323 patients who died before any primary outcome and 41 without any screening CDU , the adjusted OR for the comparison of 122 of 1267 patients vs 174 of 1245 patients was 0\\u00b765 ( 95 % CI 0\\u00b751 - 0\\u00b784 ; p=0\\u00b7001 ) .

However , the timing for the initiation of ART during tuberculosis treatment remains unresolved . METHODS We conducted a three-group , open-label , r and omized , controlled trial in South Africa involving 642 ambulatory patients , all with tuberculosis ( confirmed by a positive sputum smear for acid-fast bacilli ) , human immunodeficiency virus infection , and a CD4 + T-cell count of less than 500 per cubic millimeter . Findings in the earlier-ART group ( ART initiated within 4 weeks after the start of tuberculosis treatment ,  214 patients ) and later-ART group ( ART initiated during the first 4 weeks of the continuation phase of tuberculosis treatment ,  215 patients ) are presented here . RESULTS At baseline , the median CD4 + T-cell count was 150 per cubic millimeter , and the median viral load was 161,000 copies per milliliter , with no significant differences between the two groups . The incidence rate of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) or death was 6.9 cases per 100 person-years in the earlier-ART group ( 18 cases ) as compared with 7.8 per 100 person-years in the later-ART group ( 19 cases ) ( incidence-rate ratio , 0.89 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.44 to 1.79 ; P=0.73 ) . However , among patients with CD4 + T-cell counts of less than 50 per cubic millimeter , the incidence rates of AIDS or death were 8.5 and 26.3 cases per 100 person-years , respectively ( incidence-rate ratio , 0.32 ; 95 % CI , 0.07 to 1.13 ; P=0.06 ) . The incidence rates of the immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome ( IRIS ) were 20.1 and 7.7 cases per 100 person-years , respectively ( incidence-rate ratio , 2.62 ; 95 % CI , 1.48 to 4.82 ; P<0.001 ) . Adverse events requiring a switching of antiretroviral drugs occurred in 10 patients in the earlier-ART group and 1 patient in the later-ART group ( P=0.006 ) . CONCLUSIONS Early initiation of ART in patients with CD4 + T-cell counts of less than 50 per cubic millimeter increased AIDS-free survival . Deferral of the initiation of ART to the first 4 weeks of the continuation phase of tuberculosis therapy in those with higher CD4 + T-cell counts reduced the risks of IRIS and other adverse events related to ART without increasing the risk of AIDS or death .

For faster and more reliable administration , paramedics increasingly use an intramuscular route . METHODS This double-blind , r and omized , noninferiority trial compared the efficacy of intramuscular midazolam with that of intravenous lorazepam for children and adults in status epilepticus treated by paramedics . Subjects whose convulsions had persisted for more than 5 minutes and who were still convulsing after paramedics arrived were given the study medication by either intramuscular autoinjector or intravenous infusion . The primary outcome was absence of seizures at the time of arrival in the emergency department without the need for rescue therapy . Secondary outcomes included endotracheal intubation , recurrent seizures , and timing of treatment relative to the cessation of convulsive seizures . This trial tested the hypothesis that intramuscular midazolam was noninferior to intravenous lorazepam by a margin of 10 percentage points . RESULTS At the time of arrival in the emergency department , seizures were absent without rescue therapy in 329 of 448 subjects ( 73.4 % ) in the intramuscular-midazolam group and in 282 of 445 ( 63.4 % ) in the intravenous-lorazepam group ( absolute difference , 10 percentage points ; 95 % confidence interval , 4.0 to 16.1 ; P<0.001 for both noninferiority and superiority ) . The two treatment groups were similar with respect to need for endotracheal intubation ( 14.1 % of subjects with intramuscular midazolam and 14.4 % with intravenous lorazepam ) and recurrence of seizures ( 11.4 % and 10.6 % , respectively ) . Among subjects whose seizures ceased before arrival in the emergency department , the median times to active treatment were 1.2 minutes in the intramuscular-midazolam group and 4.8 minutes in the intravenous-lorazepam group , with corresponding median times from active treatment to cessation of convulsions of 3.3 minutes and 1.6 minutes . Adverse-event rates were similar in the two groups . CONCLUSIONS For subjects in status epilepticus , intramuscular midazolam is at least as safe and effective as intravenous lorazepam for prehospital seizure cessation .

We r and omly assigned women with a multiple pregnancy between 12 and 20 weeks ' gestation ( 1:1 ) to pessary or control groups  , using a web-based application with a computer-generated list with r and om block sizes of two to four , stratified by hospital . Participants and investigators were aware of group allocation . For women in the pessary group , a midwife or obstetrician inserted a cervical pessary between 16 and 20 weeks ' gestation . Women in the control group did not receive the pessary , but otherwise received similar obstetrical care to those in the pessary group . The primary outcome was a composite of poor perinatal outcome : stillbirth , periventricular leucomalacia , severe respiratory distress syndrome , bronchopulmonary dysplasia , intraventricular haemorrhage , necrotising enterocolitis , proven sepsis , and neonatal death .

We assessed outcomes from the TRILOGY ACS trial based on whether or not patients had coronary angiography before treatment was chosen . METHODS TRILOGY ACS ( Clinical Trials.gov number NCT00699998 ) was a r and omised controlled trial , done at more than 800 sites worldwide . Patients with non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome who were selected for management without [ corrected ] revascularisation were r and omly assigned to clopidogrel or prasugrel . The primary endpoint was cardiovascular death , myocardial infa rct ion , or stroke at 30 months . In the present analysis we assessed differences in the primary endpoint by angiography status and whether the effects of treatment on the primary endpoint differed between patients who had angiography before enrolment and those who had not . FINDINGS 7243 patients younger than 75 years were included in the TRILOGY ACS primary analysis . 3085 ( 43 % ) had angiography at baseline , 4158 ( 57 % ) had not . Fewer patients who had angiography reached the primary endpoint at 30 months compared with those who did not have angiography , according to Kaplan-Meier analysis ( 281/3085 [ 12\\u00b78 % ] vs 480/4158 [ 16\\u00b75 % ] , adjusted hazard ratio [ HR ] 0\\u00b763 , 95 % CI 0\\u00b753 - 0\\u00b775 ; p<0\\u00b70001 ) . The proportion of patients who reached the primary endpoint was lower in the prasugrel group than in the clopidogrel group for those who had angiography ( 122/1524 [ 10\\u00b77 % ] vs 159/1561 [ 14\\u00b79 % ] , HR 0\\u00b777 , 95 % CI 0\\u00b761 - 0\\u00b798 ; p=0\\u00b7032 ) but did not differ between groups in patients who did not have angiography ( 242/2096 [ 16\\u00b73 % ] vs 238/2062 [ 16\\u00b77 % ] , HR 1\\u00b701 , 0\\u00b784 - 1\\u00b720 ; p=0\\u00b794 ; pinteraction=0\\u00b708 ) . Overall , TIMI major bleeding and GUSTO severe bleeding were rare . Bleeding outcomes tended to be higher with prasugrel but did not differ significantly between treatment groups in either angiography cohort . INTERPRETATION Among patients who had angiography who took prasugrel there were fewer cardiovascular deaths , myocardial infa rct ions , or strokes than in those who took clopidogrel . This result needs to be corroborated , but it is consistent with previous trials of more versus less intensive antiplatelet treatment . When angiography is done for acute coronary syndrome and anatomic coronary disease confirmed , the benefits and risks of intensive antiplatelet treatment exist whether the patient is treated with drugs or percutaneous coronary intervention .

RESULTS We review ed 77 studies , and 52 met our inclusion criteria . Only 85 % reported gender , and 21 % reported ethnicity . Reporting of ethnicity was strongly associated with larger ( > 280 participants ) , multicenter , government-funded trials ( P < .001 for all ) . Women are disproportionately under-represented in RCTs for all procedure categories ( AAR , 9.0 % vs 21.5 % ; CR , 30.0 % vs 42.9 % ; LER , 22.4 % vs 41.3 % ) . Minorities are under-represented in AAR studies ( 6.0 % vs 10.7 % ) and CR studies ( 6.9 % vs 9.5 % ) but are over-represented in LER studies ( 26.0 % vs 21.8 % , P < .001 for all ) . CONCLUSIONS Minority ethnicity and female gender are under-reported and under-represented in vascular surgery RCTs , particularly in small , non-government-funded and single-center trials . The generalizability of some trial results may not be applicable to these population s. Greater effort to enroll a balanced study population in RCTs may yield more broadly applicable results', 'BACKGROUND Arthroscopic partial meniscectomy is one of the most common orthopedic procedures , yet rigorous evidence of its efficacy is lacking . METHODS We conducted a multicenter , r and omized , double-blind , sham-controlled trial in 146 patients 35 to 65 years of age who had knee symptoms consistent with a degenerative medial meniscus tear and no knee osteoarthritis . Patients were r and omly assigned to arthroscopic partial meniscectomy or sham surgery . The primary outcomes were changes in the Lysholm and Western Ontario Meniscal Evaluation Tool ( WOMET ) scores ( each ranging from 0 to 100 , with lower scores indicating more severe symptoms ) and in knee pain after exercise ( rated on a scale from 0 to 10 , with 0 denoting no pain ) at 12 months after the procedure . RESULTS In the intention-to-treat analysis , there were no significant between-group differences in the change from baseline to 12 months in any primary outcome . The mean changes ( improvements ) in the primary outcome measures were as follows : Lysholm score , 21.7 points in the partial-meniscectomy group as compared with 23.3 points in the sham-surgery group ( between-group difference , -1.6 points ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , -7.2 to 4.0 ) ; WOMET score , 24.6 and 27.1 points , respectively ( between-group difference , -2.5 points ; 95 % CI , -9.2 to 4.1 ) ; and score for knee pain after exercise , 3.1 and 3.3 points , respectively ( between-group difference , -0.1 ; 95 % CI , -0.9 to 0.7 ) . There were no significant differences between groups in the number of patients who required subsequent knee surgery ( two in the partial-meniscectomy group and five in the sham-surgery group ) or serious adverse events ( one and zero , respectively ) . CONCLUSIONS In this trial involving patients without knee osteoarthritis but with symptoms of a degenerative medial meniscus tear , the outcomes after arthroscopic partial meniscectomy were no better than those after a sham surgical procedure .

Study participants and clinical assessors were masked to drug allocation . Allocation to continuous or discontinuous treatment was masked up to 3 months , at which point investigators and participants were unmasked . The primary outcome was BCVA at 2 years , with a prespecified non-inferiority limit of 3\\u00b75 letters . The primary safety outcome was arterial thrombotic event or hospital admission for heart failure . Analyses were by modified intention to treat . This trial is registered , number IS RCT N92166560 . FINDINGS Between March 27 , 2008 , and Oct 15 , 2010 , 628 patients underwent r and omisation . 18 were withdrawn ; 610 received study drugs ( 314 ranibizumab ; 296 bevacizumab ) and were included in analyses . 525 participants reached the visit at 2 years : 134 ranibizumab in continuous regimen , 137 ranibizumab in discontinuous regimen , 127 bevacizumab in continuous regimen , and 127 bevacizumab in discontinuous regimen . For BCVA , bevacizumab was neither non-inferior nor inferior to ranibizumab ( mean difference -1\\u00b737 letters , 95 % CI -3\\u00b775 to 1\\u00b701 ; p=0\\u00b726 ) . Discontinuous treatment was neither non-inferior nor inferior to continuous treatment ( -1\\u00b763 letters , -4\\u00b701 to 0\\u00b775 ; p=0\\u00b718 ) . Frequency of arterial thrombotic events or hospital admission for heart failure did not differ between groups given ranibizumab ( 20 [ 6 % ] of 314 participants ) and bevacizumab ( 12 [ 4 % ] of 296 ; odds ratio [ OR ] 1\\u00b769 , 95 % CI 0\\u00b780 - 3\\u00b757 ; p=0\\u00b716 ) , or those given continuous ( 12 [ 4 % ] of 308 ) and discontinuous treatment ( 20 [ 7 % ] of 302 ; 0\\u00b756 , 0\\u00b727 - 1\\u00b719 ; p=0\\u00b713 ) .

FUNDING UK National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment programme', 'BACKGROUND Patients with metastatic colorectal cancer that harbors KRAS mutations in exon 2 do not benefit from anti-epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) therapy . Other activating RAS mutations may also be negative predictive biomarkers for anti-EGFR therapy . METHODS In this prospect ive-retrospective analysis , we assessed the efficacy and safety of panitumumab plus oxaliplatin , fluorouracil , and leucovorin ( FOLFOX4 ) as compared with FOLFOX4 alone , according to RAS ( KRAS or NRAS ) or BRAF mutation status . A total of 639 patients who had metastatic colorectal cancer without KRAS mutations in exon 2 had results for at least one of the following : KRAS exon 3 or 4 ; NRAS exon 2 , 3 , or 4 ; or BRAF exon 15 . The overall rate of ascertainment of RAS status was 90 % . RESULTS Among 512 patients without RAS mutations , progression-free survival was 10.1 months with panitumumab-FOLFOX4 versus 7.9 months with FOLFOX4 alone ( hazard ratio for progression or death with combination therapy , 0.72 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.58 to 0.90 ; P=0.004 ) . Overall survival was 26.0 months in the panitumumab-FOLFOX4 group versus 20.2 months in the FOLFOX4-alone group ( hazard ratio for death , 0.78 ; 95 % CI , 0.62 to 0.99 ; P=0.04 ) . A total of 108 patients ( 17 % ) with nonmutated KRAS exon 2 had other RAS mutations . These mutations were associated with inferior progression-free survival and overall survival with panitumumab-FOLFOX4 treatment , which was consistent with the findings in patients with KRAS mutations in exon 2 .  BRAF mutations were a negative prognostic factor . No new safety signals were identified . CONCLUSIONS Additional RAS mutations predicted a lack of response in patients who received panitumumab-FOLFOX4 . In patients who had metastatic colorectal cancer without RAS mutations , improvements in overall survival were observed with panitumumab-FOLFOX4 therapy .

The primary endpoint was first cardiovascular event , including cardiovascular mortality and morbidity , revascularisation , and non-traumatic amputation within 5 years . Patients and staff assessing outcomes were unaware of the practice 's study group assignment . Analysis was done by intention to treat . This study is registered with Clinical Trials.gov , number NCT00237549 . Findings Primary endpoint data were available for 3055 ( 99\\u00b79 % ) of 3057 screen-detected patients .

METHODS In this multicenter trial , we r and omly assigned patients 40 to 74 years of age with symptoms suggestive of acute coronary syndromes but without ischemic electrocardiographic changes or an initial positive troponin test to early CCTA or to st and ard evaluation in the emergency department on weekdays during daylight hours between April 2010 and January 2012 . The primary end point was length of stay in the hospital . Secondary end points included rates of discharge from the emergency department , major adverse cardiovascular events at 28 days , and cumulative costs . Safety end points were undetected acute coronary syndromes . RESULTS The rate of acute coronary syndromes  among 1000 patients with a mean ( \\u00b1SD ) age of 54\\u00b18 years ( 47 % women ) was 8 % . After early CCTA , as compared with st and ard evaluation  , the mean length of stay in the hospital was reduced by 7.6 hours ( P<0.001 ) and more patients were discharged directly from the emergency department ( 47 % vs. 12 % , P<0.001 ) . There were no undetected acute coronary syndromes and no significant differences in major adverse cardiovascular events at 28 days . After CCTA , there was more downstream testing and higher radiation exposure . The cumulative mean cost of care was similar in the CCTA group and the st and ard-evaluation group ( $ 4,289 and $ 4,060 , respectively ; P=0.65 ) . CONCLUSIONS In patients in the emergency department with symptoms suggestive of acute coronary syndromes , incorporating CCTA into a triage strategy improved the efficiency of clinical decision making , as compared with a st and ard evaluation in the emergency department , but it result ed in an increase in downstream testing and radiation exposure with no decrease in the overall costs of care .

Participants were r and omly allocated 1:1:1 with a remote computer allocation to receive a silver alloy-coated catheter , a nitrofural-impregnated catheter , or a PTFE-coated catheter ( control group ) . Patients undergoing unplanned catheterisation were also included and consent for participation was obtained retrospectively . Participants and trial staff were unmasked to treatment assignment . Data were collected by trial staff and by patient-reported question naires for 6 weeks after r and omisation . The primary outcome was incidence of symptomatic urinary tract infection for which an antibiotic was prescribed by 6 weeks . We postulated that a 3\\u00b73 % absolute reduction in CAUTI would represent sufficient benefit to recommend routine use of antimicrobial catheters .

We aim ed to compare the effect of annual versus twice-yearly distribution of azithromycin on infection with these strains . METHODS We did a cluster-r and omised trial in 24 subdistricts in northern Ethiopia , which we r and omly assigned to receive annual or twice-yearly treatment for all residents of all ages . R and om assignment was done with the R AND OM and SORT functions of Microsoft Excel . All individuals were offered their assigned treatment of a single , directly observed , oral dose of azithromycin . A 6 week course of topical 1 % tetracycline ointment , applied twice daily to both eyes but not directly observed , was offered as an alternative to azithromycin in patients younger than 12 months , and in patients with self-reported pregnancy , with allergy , or who refused azithromycin .  Our primary , prespecified outcome was the prevalence of ocular chlamydial infection in a r and om sample of children aged 0 - 9 years at baseline and every 6 months for a total of 42 months within sentinel villages . Our analysis was by intention to treat . This study is registered with Clinical Trials.gov , number NCT00322972 . FINDINGS Antibiotic coverage of children aged 1 - 9 years was greater than 80 % ( range 80\\u00b79 to 93\\u00b70 ) at all study visits . In the groups treated annually , the prevalence of infection in children aged 0 - 9 years was reduced from a mean 41\\u00b79 % ( 95 % CI 31\\u00b75 to 52\\u00b72 ) at baseline to 1\\u00b79 % ( 0\\u00b73 to 3\\u00b75 ) at 42 months .

FUNDING National Institutes of Health ( NEI U10 EY016214 )', 'BACKGROUND Atherosclerotic renal-artery stenosis is a common problem in the elderly . Despite two r and omized trials that did not show a benefit of renal-artery stenting with respect to kidney function , the usefulness of stenting for the prevention of major adverse renal and cardiovascular events is uncertain . METHODS We r and omly assigned 947 participants who had atherosclerotic renal-artery stenosis and either systolic hypertension while taking two or more antihypertensive drugs or chronic kidney disease to medical therapy plus renal-artery stenting or medical therapy alone . Participants were followed for the occurrence of adverse cardiovascular and renal events ( a composite end point of death from cardiovascular or renal causes , myocardial infa rct ion , stroke , hospitalization for congestive heart failure , progressive renal insufficiency , or the need for renal-replacement therapy ) . RESULTS Over a median follow-up period of 43 months ( interquartile range , 31 to 55 ) , the rate of the primary composite end point did not differ significantly between participants who underwent stenting in addition to receiving medical therapy and those who received medical therapy alone ( 35.1 % and 35.8 % , respectively ; hazard ratio with stenting , 0.94 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.76 to 1.17 ; P=0.58 ) . There were also no significant differences between the treatment groups in the rates of the individual components of the primary end point or in all-cause mortality . During follow-up , there was a consistent modest difference in systolic blood pressure favoring the stent group ( -2.3 mm Hg ; 95 % CI , -4.4 to -0.2 ; P=0.03 ) . CONCLUSIONS Renal-artery stenting did not confer a significant benefit with respect to the prevention of clinical events when added to comprehensive , multifactorial medical therapy in people with atherosclerotic renal-artery stenosis and hypertension or chronic kidney disease .

A baseline survey identified 256 clusters , which were r and omly assigned ( within urban and rural strata , by computer-generated r and om numbers ) to one of three groups : non-supplemented control ( group A ) , micronutrient powder without zinc ( group B ) , or micronutrient powder with 10 mg zinc ( group C ) . Children in the clusters aged 6 months were eligible for inclusion in the study . Powders were to be given daily between 6 and 18 months of age ; follow-up was to age 2 years . Micronutrient powder sachets for groups B and C were identical except for colour ; investigators and field and supervisory staff were masked to composition of the micronutrient powders until trial completion . Parents knew whether their child was receiving supplementation , but did not know whether the powder contained zinc . Primary outcomes were growth , episodes of diarrhoea , acute lower respiratory tract infection , fever , and incidence of admission to hospital . This trial is registered with Clinical Trials.gov , number NCT00705445 . RESULTS The trial was done between Nov 1 , 2008 , and Dec 31 , 2011 . 947 children were enrolled in group A clusters , 910 in group B clusters , and 889 in group C clusters . Micronutrient powder administration was associated with lower risk of iron-deficiency anaemia at 18 months compared with the control group ( odds ratio [ OR ] for micronutrient powder without zinc=0\\u00b720 , 95 % CI 0\\u00b711 - 0\\u00b736 ; OR for micronutrient powder with zinc=0\\u00b725 , 95 % CI 0\\u00b714 - 0\\u00b744 ) .

We recorded strong evidence of an increased proportion of days with diarrhoea ( p=0\\u00b7001 ) and increased incidence of bloody diarrhoea ( p=0\\u00b7003 ) between 6 and 18 months in the two micronutrient powder groups , and reported chest indrawing ( p=0\\u00b703 ) . Incidence of febrile episodes or admission to hospital for diarrhoea , respiratory problems , or febrile episodes did not differ between the three groups . INTERPRETATION Use of micronutrient powders reduces iron-deficiency anaemia in young children . However , the excess burden of diarrhoea and respiratory morbidities associated with micronutrient powder use and the very small effect on growth recorded suggest that a careful assessment of risks and benefits must be done in population s with malnourished children and high diarrhoea burdens .

METHODS At 29 centers in the United Kingdom , we conducted a r and omized noninferiority trial comparing low-dose and high-dose radioiodine , each in combination with either thyrotropin alfa or thyroid hormone withdrawal before ablation .  Patients ( age range , 16 to 80 years ) had tumor stage T1 to T3 , with possible spread to nearby lymph nodes but without metastasis . End points were the rate of success of ablation at 6 to 9 months , adverse events , quality of life , and length of hospital stay . RESULTS A total of 438 patients underwent r and omization ; data could be analyzed for 421 .  Ablation success rates were 85.0 % in the group receiving low-dose radioiodine versus 88.9 % in the group receiving the high dose and 87.1 % in the thyrotropin alfa group versus 86.7 % in the group undergoing thyroid hormone withdrawal . All 95 % confidence intervals for the differences were within \\u00b110 percentage points , indicating noninferiority . Similar results were found for low-dose radioiodine plus thyrotropin alfa ( 84.3 % ) versus high-dose radioiodine plus thyroid hormone withdrawal ( 87.6 % ) or high-dose radioiodine plus thyrotropin alfa ( 90.2 % ) . More patients in the high-dose group than in the low-dose group were hospitalized for at least 3 days ( 36.3 % vs. 13.0 % , P<0.001 ) .

The CYP2C19 * 2 allele is a common genetic variant associated with increased rates of major adverse events in individuals given clopidogrel after percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) .  We used a novel point-of-care genetic test to identify carriers of the CYP2C19 * 2 allele and aim ed to assess a pharmacogenetic approach to dual antiplatelet treatment after PCI . METHODS Between Aug 26 , 2010 , and July 7 , 2011 , 200 patients were enrolled into our prospect i ve , r and omised , proof-of-concept study . Patients undergoing PCI for acute coronary syndrome or stable angina were r and omly assigned to rapid point-of-care genotyping or to st and ard treatment . Individuals in the rapid genotyping group were screened for the CYP2C19 * 2 allele . Carriers were given 10 mg prasugrel daily , and non-carriers and patients in the st and ard treatment group were given 75 mg clopidogrel daily . The primary endpoint was the proportion of CYP2C19 * 2 carriers with high on-treatment platelet reactivity ( P2Y12 reactivity unit [ PRU ] value of more than 234 ) after 1 week of dual antiplatelet treatment , which is a marker associated with increased adverse cardiovascular events .

Therefore , methods to increase graft viability are needed . Here , we report the results of a triple-blind , placebo-controlled trial to compare the survival of fat grafts enriched with autologous adipose-derived stem cells ( ASCs ) versus non-enriched fat grafts . METHODS Healthy participants underwent two liposuctions  taken 14 days apart : one for ASC isolation and ex-vivo expansion , and another for the preparation of fat grafts . Two purified fat grafts ( 30 mL each ) taken from the second liposuction were prepared for each participant . One graft was enriched with ASCs ( 20 \\u00d7 10(6 ) cells per mL fat ) , and another graft without ASC enrichment served as a control . The fat grafts were injected subcutaneously as a bolus to the posterior part of the right and left upper arm according to the r and omisation sequence . The volumes of injected fat grafts were measured by MRI immediately after injection and after 121 days before surgical removal . The primary goal was to compare the residual graft volumes of ASC-enriched grafts with those of control grafts . This study is registered at www . clinical trialsregister.eu , number 2010 - 023006 - 12 . FINDINGS 13 participants were enrolled , three of whom were excluded . Compared with the control grafts , the ASC-enriched fat grafts had significantly higher residual volumes : 23\\u00b700 ( 95 % CI 20\\u00b757 - 25\\u00b743 ) cm(3 ) versus 4\\u00b766 ( 3\\u00b716 - 6\\u00b716 ) cm(3 ) for the controls , corresponding to 80\\u00b79 % ( 76\\u00b76 - 85\\u00b72 ) versus 16\\u00b73 % ( 11\\u00b71 - 21\\u00b74 ) of the initial volumes , respectively ( p<0\\u00b70001 ) . The difference between the groups was 18\\u00b734 ( 95 % CI 15\\u00b770 - 20\\u00b798 ) cm(3 ) , equivalent to 64\\u00b76 % ( 57\\u00b71 - 72\\u00b71 ; p<0\\u00b70001 ) . No serious adverse events were noted . INTERPRETATION The procedure of ASC-enriched fat grafting  had excellent feasibility and safety . These promising results add significantly to the prospect of stem cell use in clinical setting s , and indicate that ASC graft enrichment could render lipofilling a reliable alternative to major tissue augmentation , such as breast surgery , with allogeneic material or major flap surgery .

METHODS In our 3 year , r and omised , double-blind , placebo-controlled study , undertaken at 65 academic medical centres or outpatient clinics in North America , we enrolled men aged 48 - 82 years who had low-volume , Gleason score 5 - 6 prostate cancer and had chosen to be followed up with active surveillance . We r and omly allocated participants in a one-to-one ratio , stratified by site and in block sizes of four , to receive once-daily dutasteride 0\\u00b75 mg or matching placebo . Participants were followed up for 3 years , with 12-core prostate biopsy sample s obtained after 18 months and 3 years . The primary endpoint was time to prostate cancer progression , defined as the number of days between the start of study treatment and the earlier of either pathological progression ( in patients with \\u22651 biopsy assessment after baseline ) or therapeutic progression ( start of medical therapy ) . This trial is registered with Clinical Trials.gov , number NCT00363311 . FINDINGS Between Aug 10 , 2006 , and March 26 , 2007 , we r and omly allocated 302 participants , of whom 289 ( 96 % ) had at least one biopsy procedure after baseline and were included in the primary analysis . By 3 years , 54 ( 38 % ) of 144 men in the dutasteride group and 70 ( 48 % ) of 145 controls had prostate cancer progression ( pathological or therapeutic ; hazard ratio 0\\u00b762 , 95 % CI 0\\u00b743 - 0\\u00b789 ; p=0\\u00b7009 ) . Incidence of adverse events was much the same between treatment groups . 35 ( 24 % ) men in the dutasteride group and 23 ( 15 % ) controls had sexual adverse events or breast enlargement or tenderness . Eight ( 5 % ) men in the dutasteride group and seven ( 5 % ) controls had cardiovascular adverse events , but there were no prostate cancer-related deaths or instances of metastatic disease . INTERPRETATION Dutasteride could provide a beneficial adjunct to active surveillance for men with low-risk prostate cancer . FUNDING GlaxoSmithKline', 'BACKGROUND Dolutegravir ( S/GSK1349572 ) , a once-daily , unboosted integrase inhibitor , was recently approved in the United States for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) infection in combination with other antiretroviral agents . Dolutegravir , in combination with abacavir-lamivudine , may provide a simplified regimen . METHODS We conducted a r and omized , double-blind , phase 3 study involving adult participants who had not received previous therapy for HIV-1 infection and who had an HIV-1 RNA level of 1000 copies per milliliter or more . Participants were r and omly assigned to dolutegravir at a dose of 50 mg plus abacavir-lamivudine once daily ( DTG-ABC-3TC group ) or combination therapy with efavirenz-tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (DF)-emtricitabine once daily ( EFV-TDF-FTC group ) . The primary end point was the proportion of participants with an HIV-1 RNA level of less than 50 copies per milliliter at week 48 . Secondary end points included the time to viral suppression , the change from baseline in CD4 + T-cell count , safety , and viral resistance . RESULTS A total of 833 participants received at least one dose of study drug . At week 48 , the proportion of participants with an HIV-1 RNA level of less than 50 copies per milliliter was significantly higher in the DTG-ABC-3TC group than in the EFV-TDF-FTC group ( 88 % vs. 81 % , P=0.003 ) , thus meeting the criterion for superiority . The DTG-ABC-3TC group had a shorter median time to viral suppression than did the EFV-TDF-FTC group ( 28 vs. 84 days , P<0.001 ) , as well as greater increases in CD4 + T-cell count ( 267 vs. 208 per cubic millimeter , P<0.001 ) . The proportion of participants who discontinued therapy owing to adverse events was lower in the DTG-ABC-3TC group than in the EFV-TDF-FTC group ( 2 % vs. 10 % ) ; rash and neuropsychiatric events ( including abnormal dreams , anxiety , dizziness , and somnolence ) were significantly more common in the EFV-TDF-FTC group , whereas insomnia was reported more frequently in the DTG-ABC-3TC group . No participants in the DTG-ABC-3TC group had detectable antiviral resistance ; one tenofovir DF-associated mutation and four efavirenz-associated mutations were detected in participants with virologic failure in the EFV-TDF-FTC group . CONCLUSIONS Dolutegravir plus abacavir-lamivudine had a better safety profile and was more effective through 48 weeks than the regimen with efavirenz-tenofovir DF-emtricitabine .

The objective of this study is to determine the current level of compliance with these guidelines for the inclusion , analysis , and reporting of sex and race/ethnicity in federally funded r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) and to compare the current level of compliance with that from 2004 , which was reported previously . METHODS  RCTs published in nine prominent medical journals in 2009 were identified by PubMed search . Studies where individuals were not the unit of analysis , those begun before 1994 , and those not receiving federal funding were excluded . PubMed search located 512 published articles . After exclusion of ineligible articles , 86 ( 17 % ) remained for analysis . RESULTS Thirty studies were sex specific . The  median enrollment of women in the 56 studies that included both men and women was 37 % . Seventy-five percent of the studies did not report any outcomes by sex , including 9 studies reporting < 20 % women enrolled . Among all 86 studies , 21 % did not report sample sizes by racial and ethnic groups , and 64 % did not provide any analysis by racial or ethnic groups . Only 3 studies indicated that the generalizability of their results may be limited by lack of diversity among those studied . There were no statistically significant changes in inclusion or reporting of sex or race/ethnicity when compared with 2004 .

METHODS We carried out a 36-month , r and omized , double-blind , double-dummy , phase 3 study comparing oral mycophenolate mofetil ( 2 g per day ) and oral azathioprine ( 2 mg per kilogram of body weight per day ) , plus placebo in each group , in patients who met response criteria during a 6-month induction trial . The study group underwent repeat r and omization in a 1:1 ratio . Up to 10 mg of prednisone per day or its equivalent was permitted . The primary efficacy end point was the time to treatment failure , which was defined as death , end-stage renal disease , doubling of the serum creatinine level , renal flare , or rescue therapy for lupus nephritis . Secondary assessment s included the time to the individual components of treatment failure and adverse events . RESULTS A total of 227 patients were r and omly assigned to maintenance treatment ( 116 to mycophenolate mofetil and 111 to azathioprine ) . Mycophenolate mofetil was superior to azathioprine with respect to the primary end point , time to treatment failure ( hazard ratio , 0.44 ; 95 % confidence interval , 0.25 to 0.77 ; P = 0.003 ) , and with respect to time to renal flare and time to rescue therapy ( hazard ratio , < 1.00 ; P < 0.05 ) . Observed rates of treatment failure were 16.4 % ( 19 of 116 patients ) in the mycophenolate mofetil group and 32.4 % ( 36 of 111 ) in the azathioprine group . Adverse events , most commonly minor infections and gastrointestinal disorders , occurred in more than 95 % of the patients in both groups ( P = 0.68 ) . Serious adverse events occurred in 33.3 % of patients in the azathioprine group and in 23.5 % of those in the mycophenolate mofetil group ( P = 0.11 ) , and the rate of withdrawal due to adverse events was higher with azathioprine than with mycophenolate mofetil ( 39.6 % vs. 25.2 % , P = 0.02 ) . CONCLUSIONS Mycophenolate mofetil was superior to azathioprine in maintaining a renal response to treatment and in preventing relapse in patients with lupus nephritis who had a response to induction therapy .

Our objective was to assess whether daily bathing in chlorhexidine gluconate ( CHG ) compared with st and ard bathing practice s would reduce bacteraemia in critically ill children . METHODS In an unmasked , cluster-r and omised , two-period crossover trial , ten paediatric intensive-care units at five hospitals in the USA were r and omly assigned a  daily bathing routine for admitted patients older than 2 months , either st and ard bathing practice s or using a cloth impregnated with 2 % CHG , for a 6-month period . Units switched to the alternative bathing method for a second 6-month period . 6482 admissions were screened for eligibility . The primary outcome was an episode of bacteraemia . We did intention-to-treat ( ITT ) and per- protocol ( PP ) analyses . This study is registered with Clinical Trials.gov ( identifier NCT00549393 ) . FINDINGS 1521 admitted patients were excluded because their length of stay was less than 2 days , and 14 refused to participate . 4947 admissions were eligible for analysis . In the ITT population , a non-significant reduction in incidence of bacteraemia was noted with CHG bathing ( 3\\u00b752 per 1000 days , 95 % CI 2\\u00b764 - 4\\u00b761 ) compared with st and ard practice s ( 4\\u00b793 per 1000 days , 3\\u00b791 - 6\\u00b715 ; adjusted incidence rate ratio [ aIRR ] 0\\u00b771 , 95 % CI 0\\u00b742 - 1\\u00b720 ) .

Combination therapy with clopidogrel and aspirin may provide greater protection against subsequent stroke than aspirin alone . METHODS In a r and omized , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial conducted at 114 centers in China , we r and omly assigned 5170 patients within 24 hours after the onset of minor ischemic stroke or high-risk TIA to combination therapy with clopidogrel and aspirin ( clopidogrel at an initial dose of 300 mg , followed by 75 mg per day for 90 days , plus aspirin at a dose of 75 mg per day for the first 21 days ) or to placebo plus aspirin ( 75 mg per day for 90 days ) . All participants received open-label aspirin at a clinician-determined dose of 75 to 300 mg on day 1 . The primary outcome was stroke ( ischemic or hemorrhagic ) during 90 days of follow-up in an intention-to-treat analysis . Treatment differences were assessed with the use of a Cox proportional-hazards model , with study center as a r and om effect . RESULTS Stroke occurred in 8.2 % of patients in the clopidogrel-aspirin group , as compared with 11.7 % of those in the aspirin group ( hazard ratio , 0.68 ; 95 % confidence interval , 0.57 to 0.81 ; P<0.001 ) . Moderate or severe hemorrhage occurred in seven patients ( 0.3 % ) in the clopidogrel-aspirin group and in eight ( 0.3 % ) in the aspirin group ( P=0.73 ) ; the rate of hemorrhagic stroke was 0.3 % in each group . CONCLUSIONS Among patients with TIA or minor stroke who can be treated within 24 hours after the onset of symptoms , the combination of clopidogrel and aspirin is superior to aspirin alone for reducing the risk of stroke in the first 90 days and does not increase the risk of hemorrhage .

We investigated the effectiveness of tofacitinib ( CP-690,550 ) , a novel oral Janus kinase inhibitor , as a targeted immunomodulator and disease-modifying therapy for rheumatoid arthritis . METHODS We did a 6-month , double-blind , parallel-group phase 3 study at 82 centres in 13 countries , including North America , Europe , and Latin America . 399 patients aged 18 years or older with moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis and inadequate response to tumour necrosis factor inhibitors ( TNFi ) were r and omly assigned in a 2:2:1:1 ratio with an automated internet or telephone system to receive twice a day treatment with : tofacitinib 5 mg ( n=133 ) ; tofacitinib 10 mg ( n=134 ) ; or placebo ( n=132 ) , all with methotrexate . At month 3 , patients given placebo advanced to either tofacitinib 5 mg twice a day ( n=66 ) or 10 mg twice a day ( n=66 ) .

FUNDING Pfizer', 'BACKGROUND Interim results from the children with HIV early antiretroviral ( CHER ) trial showed that early antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) was life-saving for infants infected with HIV . In view of the few treatment options and the potential toxicity associated with lifelong ART , in the CHER trial we compared early time-limited ART with deferred ART . METHODS CHER was an open-label r and omised controlled trial of HIV-infected asymptomatic infants younger than 12 weeks in two South African trial sites with a percentage of CD4-positive T lymphocytes ( CD4 % ) of 25 % or higher . 377 infants were r and omly allocated to one of three groups : deferred ART ( ART-Def ) , immediate ART for 40 weeks ( ART-40W ) , or immediate ART for 96 weeks ( ART-96W ) , with subsequent treatment interruption . The r and omisation schedule was stratified by clinical site with permuted blocks of r and om sizes to balance the numbers of infants allocated to each group . Criteria for ART initiation in the ART-Def group and re-initiation after interruption in the other groups were CD4 % less than 25 % in infancy ; otherwise , the criteria were CD4 % less than 20 % or Centers for Disease Control and Prevention severe stage B or stage C disease . Combination therapy of lopinavir-ritonavir , zidovudine , and lamivudine was the first-line treatment regimen at ART initiation and re-initiation . The primary endpoint was time to failure of first-line ART ( immunological , clinical , or virological ) or death . Comparisons were done by intention-to-treat analysis , with use of time-to-event methods . This trial is registered with Clinical Trials.gov , number NCT00102960 . FINDINGS 377 infants were enrolled , with a median age of 7\\u00b74 weeks , CD4 % of 35 % , and HIV RNA log 5\\u00b77 copies per mL. Median follow-up was 4\\u00b78 years ; 34 infants ( 9 % ) were lost to follow-up . Median time to ART initiation in the ART-Def group was 20 weeks ( IQR 16 - 25 ) . Time to restarting of ART after interruption was 33 weeks ( 26 - 45 ) in ART-40W and 70 weeks ( 35 - 109 ) in ART-96W ; at the end of the trial , 19 % of patients in ART-40W and 32 % of patients in ART-96W remained off ART . Proportions of follow-up time spent on ART were 81 % in the ART-Def group , 70 % in the ART-40W group , and 69 % in the ART-96W group . 48 ( 38 % ) of 125 children in the ART-Def group , 32 ( 25 % ) of 126 in the ART-40W group , and 26 ( 21 % ) of 126 in the ART-96W group reached the primary endpoint . The hazard ratio , relative to ART-Def , was 0\\u00b759 ( 95 % CI 0\\u00b738 - 0\\u00b793 , p=0\\u00b702 ) for ART-40W and 0\\u00b747 ( 0\\u00b727 - 0\\u00b776 , p=0\\u00b7002 ) for ART-96W . Three children in ART-Def , three in ART-40W , and one in ART-96W switched to second-line ART . INTERPRETATION Early time-limited ART had better clinical and immunological outcomes than deferred ART , with no evidence of excess disease progression during subsequent treatment interruption and less overall ART exposure than deferred ART . Longer time on primary ART permits longer subsequent interruption , with marginally better outcomes .

Mortality was significantly lower at 1 month ( 8 % vs. 24 % , P = 0.006 ) but not at 3 months ( 22 % vs. 34 % , P = 0.06 ) . Death due to the hepatorenal syndrome was less frequent in the prednisolone-N-acetylcysteine group than in the prednisolone-only group at 6 months ( 9 % vs. 22 % , P = 0.02 ) . In a multivariate analysis , factors associated with 6-month survival were a younger age ( P<0.001 ) , a shorter prothrombin time ( P<0.001 ) , a lower level of bilirubin at baseline ( P<0.001 ) , and a decrease in bilirubin on day 14 ( P<0.001 ) . Infections were less frequent in the prednisolone-N-acetylcysteine group than in the prednisolone-only group ( P = 0.001 ) ; other side effects were similar in the two groups . CONCLUSIONS Although combination therapy with prednisolone plus N-acetylcysteine increased 1-month survival among patients with severe acute alcoholic hepatitis , 6-month survival , the primary outcome , was not improved .

The TRACS trial investigated a training programme for caregivers ( the London Stroke Carers Training Course , LSCTC ) on physical and psychological outcomes , including cost-effectiveness , for patients and caregivers after a disabling stroke . METHODS We undertook a pragmatic , multicentre , cluster r and omised controlled trial with a parallel cost-effectiveness analysis . Stroke units were eligible if four of five criteria used to define a stroke unit were met , a substantial number of patients on the unit had a diagnosis of stroke , staff were able to deliver the LSCTC , and most patients were discharged to a permanent place of residence . Stroke units were r and omly assigned to either LSCTC or usual care ( control group ) , stratified by geographical region and quality of care , and using blocks of size 2 . Patients with a diagnosis of stroke , likely to return home with residual disability and with a caregiver providing support were eligible . The primary outcome for patients was self-reported extended activities of daily living at 6 months , measured with the Nottingham Extended Activities of Daily Living ( NEADL ) scale . The primary outcome for caregivers was self-reported burden at 6 months , measured with the caregivers burden scale ( CBS ) . We combined patient and caregiver costs with primary outcomes and quality -adjusted life-years ( QALYs ) to assess cost-effectiveness . This trial is registered with controlled-trials.com , number IS RCT N 49208824 . FINDINGS We assessed 49 stroke units for eligibility , of which 36 were r and omly assigned to either the intervention group or the control group . Between Feb 27 , 2008 , and Feb 9 , 2010 , 928 patient and caregiver dyads were registered , of which 450 were in the intervention group , and 478 in the control group .  Patients ' self-reported extended activities of daily living did not differ between groups at 6 months ( adjusted mean NEADL score 27\\u00b74 in the intervention group versus 27\\u00b76 in the control group , difference -0\\u00b72 points [ 95 % CI -3\\u00b70 to 2\\u00b75 ] , p value=0\\u00b7866 , ICC=0\\u00b7027 ) . The caregiver burden scale did not differ between groups either ( adjusted mean CBS 45\\u00b75 in the intervention group versus 45\\u00b70 in the control group , difference 0\\u00b75 points [ 95 % CI -1\\u00b77 to 2\\u00b77 ] , p value=0\\u00b7660 , ICC=0\\u00b7013 ) . Patient and caregiver costs were similar in both groups ( length of the initial stroke admission and associated costs were \\u00a3 13,127 for the intervention group and \\u00a3 12,471 for the control group ; adjusted mean difference \\u00a3 1243 [ 95 % CI -1533 to 4019 ] ; p value=0\\u00b7380 ) . Probabilities of cost-effectiveness based on QALYs were low . INTERPRETATION In a large scale , robust evaluation , results from this study have shown no differences between the LSCTC and usual care on any of the assessed outcomes . The immediate period after stroke might not be the ideal time to deliver structured caregiver training . FUNDING Medical Research Council\\\", 'Differential enrollment into clinical trials by gender has been described previously . In 1993 , the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) Revitalization Act was enacted to promote the inclusion of women in clinical trials . The purpose of this study was to review patterns in clinical trial enrollment among studies published in a major medical journal to determine the effects of this policy . A systematic search was conducted of all articles published in the Original Articles section of The New Engl and Journal of Medicine from 1994 to 1999 . Two independent observers abstract ed information from the r and omized clinical trials using st and ardized forms . All r and omized clinical trials in which the primary end point was total mortality or included mortality in a composite end point were considered for review . Trials were analyzed for enrollment of women with respect to disease state , funding source , site of trial performance , and use of gender-specific data analysis . From 1994 to 1999 , 1322 original articles were published in The New Engl and Journal of Medicine , including 442 r and omized , controlled trials of which 120 met our inclusion criteria . On average , 24.6 % women were enrolled .  Gender-specific data analysis was performed in 14 % of the trials . The NIH Revitalization Act does not appear to have improved gender-balanced enrollment or promoted the use of gender-specific analyses in clinical trials published in an influential medical journal . Overcoming this trend will require rigorous efforts on the part of funding entities , trial investigators , and journals disseminating study results', 'BACKGROUND Current treatment recommendations for patients with polycythemia vera call for maintaining a hematocrit of less than 45 % , but this therapeutic strategy has not been tested in a r and omized clinical trial . METHODS We r and omly assigned 365 adults with JAK2-positive polycythemia vera who were being treated with phlebotomy , hydroxyurea , or both to receive either more intensive treatment ( target hematocrit , < 45 % ) ( low-hematocrit group ) or less intensive treatment ( target hematocrit , 45 to 50 % ) ( high-hematocrit group ) . The primary composite end point was the time until death from cardiovascular causes or major thrombotic events . The secondary end points were cardiovascular events , cardiovascular hospitalizations , incidence of cancer , progression to myelofibrosis , myelodysplasia or leukemic transformation , and hemorrhage . An intention-to-treat analysis was performed . RESULTS After a median follow-up of 31 months , the primary end point was recorded in 5 of 182 patients in the low-hematocrit group ( 2.7 % ) and 18 of 183 patients in the high-hematocrit group ( 9.8 % ) ( hazard ratio in the high-hematocrit group , 3.91 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 1.45 to 10.53 ; P=0.007 ) . The primary end point plus superficial-vein thrombosis occurred in 4.4 % of patients in the low-hematocrit group , as compared with 10.9 % in the high-hematocrit group ( hazard ratio , 2.69 ; 95 % CI , 1.19 to 6.12 ; P=0.02 ) . Progression to myelofibrosis , myelodysplasia or leukemic transformation , and bleeding were observed in 6 , 2 , and 2 patients , respectively , in the low-hematocrit group , as compared with 2 , 1 , and 5 patients , respectively , in the high-hematocrit group . There was no significant between-group difference in the rate of adverse events . CONCLUSIONS In patients with polycythemia vera , those with a hematocrit target of less than 45 % had a significantly lower rate of cardiovascular death and major thrombosis than did those with a hematocrit target of 45 to 50 % .

Pilot studies of treatment with arsenic trioxide with or without ATRA have shown high efficacy and reduced hematologic toxicity . METHODS We conducted a phase 3 , multicenter trial comparing ATRA plus chemotherapy with ATRA plus arsenic trioxide in patients with APL classified as low-to-intermediate risk ( white-cell count , \\u226410 \\u00d7 10(9 ) per liter ) . Patients were r and omly assigned to receive either ATRA plus arsenic trioxide for induction and consolidation therapy or st and ard ATRA-idarubicin induction therapy followed by three cycles of consolidation therapy with ATRA plus chemotherapy and maintenance therapy with low-dose chemotherapy and ATRA . The study was design ed as a noninferiority trial to show that the difference between the rates of event-free survival at 2 years in the two groups was not greater than 5 % . RESULTS Complete remission was achieved in all 77 patients in the ATRA-arsenic  trioxide group who could be evaluated ( 100 % ) and in 75 of 79 patients in the ATRA-chemotherapy group ( 95 % ) ( P=0.12 ) . The median follow-up was 34.4 months . Two-year event-free survival rates were 97 % in the ATRA-arsenic trioxide group and 86 % in the ATRA-chemotherapy group ( 95 % confidence interval for the difference , 2 to 22 percentage points ; P<0.001 for noninferiority and P=0.02 for superiority of ATRA-arsenic trioxide ) . Overall survival was also better with ATRA-arsenic trioxide ( P=0.02 ) . As compared with ATRA-chemotherapy , ATRA-arsenic trioxide was associated with less hematologic toxicity and fewer infections but with more hepatic toxicity . CONCLUSIONS ATRA plus arsenic trioxide is at least not inferior and may be superior to ATRA plus chemotherapy in the treatment of patients with low-to-intermediate-risk APL .

METHODS Patients with Alzheimer 's disease and psychosis or agitation-aggression received open-label treatment with risperidone for 16 weeks . Those who had a response to risperidone therapy were then r and omly assigned , in a double-blind fashion , to one of three regimens : continued risperidone therapy for 32 weeks ( group 1 ) , risperidone therapy for 16 weeks followed by placebo for 16 weeks ( group 2 ) , or placebo for 32 weeks ( group 3 ) . The primary outcome was the time to relapse of psychosis or agitation . RESULTS A total of 180 patients received open-label  risperidone ( mean dose , 0.97 mg daily ) . The severity of psychosis and agitation were reduced , although there was a mild increase in extrapyramidal signs ;  112 patients met the criteria for response to treatment , of whom 110 underwent r and omization . In the first 16 weeks after r and omization , the rate of relapse was higher in the group that received placebo than in the groups that received risperidone ( 60 % [ 24 of 40 patients in group 3 ] vs. 33 % [ 23 of 70 in groups 1 and 2 ] ; P=0.004 ; hazard ratio with placebo , 1.94 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 1.09 to 3.45 ; P=0.02 ) .

METHODS We conducted a double-blind , placebo-controlled trial in which 1537 patients with probable Alzheimer 's disease underwent r and omization to receive 100 mg of semagacestat , 140 mg of semagacestat , or placebo daily .  Changes in cognition from baseline to week 76 were assessed with the use of the cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer 's Disease Assessment Scale for cognition ( ADAS-cog ) , on which scores range from 0 to 70 and higher scores indicate greater cognitive impairment , and changes in functioning were assessed with the Alzheimer 's Disease Cooperative Study -Activities of Daily Living ( ADCS-ADL ) scale , on which scores range from 0 to 78 and higher scores indicate better functioning . A mixed-model repeated- measures analysis was used . RESULTS The trial was terminated before completion on the basis of a recommendation by the data and safety monitoring board . At termination , there were 189 patients in the group receiving placebo  , 153 patients in the group receiving 100 mg of semagacestat , and 121 patients in the group receiving 140 mg of semagacestat .  The ADAS-cog scores worsened in all three groups ( mean change , 6.4 points in the placebo group , 7.5 points in the group receiving 100 mg of the study drug , and 7.8 points in the group receiving 140 mg ; P=0.15 and P=0.07 , respectively , for the comparison with placebo ) . The ADCS-ADL scores also worsened in all groups ( mean change at week 76 , -9.0 points in the placebo group , -10.5 points in the 100-mg group , and -12.6 points in the 140-mg group ; P=0.14 and P<0.001 , respectively , for the comparison with placebo ) . Patients treated with semagacestat  lost more weight and had more skin cancers and infections , treatment discontinuations due to adverse events , and serious adverse events ( P<0.001 for all comparisons with placebo ) .

Bruton 's tyrosine kinase ( BTK ) , an essential component of B-cell-receptor signaling , mediates interactions with the tumor microenvironment and promotes the survival and proliferation of CLL cells . METHODS We conducted a phase 1b-2 multicenter study to assess the safety , efficacy , pharmacokinetics , and pharmacodynamics of ibrutinib ( PCI-32765 ) , a first-in-class , oral covalent inhibitor of BTK design ed for treatment of B-cell cancers , in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL or small lymphocytic lymphoma . A total of 85 patients , the majority of whom were considered to have high-risk disease , received ibrutinib orally once daily ; 51 received 420 mg , and 34 received 840 mg . RESULTS Toxic effects were predominantly grade 1 or 2 and included transient diarrhea , fatigue , and upper respiratory tract infection ; thus , patients could receive extended treatment with minimal hematologic toxic effects . The overall response rate was the same in the group that received 420 mg and the group that received 840 mg ( 71 % ) , and an additional 20 % and 15 % of patients in the respective groups had a partial response with lymphocytosis . The response was independent of clinical and genomic risk factors present before treatment , including advanced-stage disease , the number of previous therapies , and the 17p13.1 deletion . At 26 months , the estimated progression-free survival rate was 75 % and the rate of overall survival was 83 % .

DESIGN Multicenter r and omized , controlled trial with a noninferiority design based on a minimal clinical ly important difference of 2.0 % . R and omization was electronically generated ; patients were assigned to a treatment group through a Web-based program . Patients , physicians , study coordinators , health care team members , outcome adjudicators , and data analysts were blinded to interventions . ( Current Controlled Trials : IS RCT N11902170 ) . SETTING 12 tertiary care orthopedic referral centers in Canada . PATIENTS 778 patients who had elective unilateral THA between 2007 and 2010 . INTERVENTION After an initial 10 days of dalteparin prophylaxis after elective THA , patients were r and omly assigned to 28 days of dalteparin ( n = 400 ) or aspirin ( n = 386 ) . MEASUREMENTS Symptomatic VTE confirmed by objective testing ( primary efficacy outcome ) and bleeding . RESULTS Five of 398 patients ( 1.3 % ) r and omly assigned to dalteparin and 1 of 380 ( 0.3 % ) r and omly assigned to aspirin  had VTE ( absolute difference , 1.0 percentage point [ 95 % CI , -0.5 to 2.5 percentage points ] ) . Aspirin was noninferior ( P < 0.001 ) but not superior ( P = 0.22 ) to dalteparin . Clinical ly significant bleeding occurred in 5 patients ( 1.3 % ) receiving dalteparin and 2 ( 0.5 % ) receiving aspirin . The absolute between-group difference in a composite of all VTE and clinical ly significant bleeding events was 1.7 percentage points ( CI , -0.3 to 3.8 percentage points ; P = 0.091 ) in favor of aspirin . LIMITATION The study was halted prematurely because of difficulty with patient recruitment . CONCLUSION Extended prophylaxis for 28 days with aspirin was noninferior to and as safe as dalteparin for the prevention of VTE after THA in patients who initially received dalteparin for 10 days . Given its low cost and greater convenience , aspirin may be considered a reasonable alternative for extended thromboprophylaxis after THA .

Retention at study follow-up was more than 93 % . LIMITATION Only 2 Facebook communities were included for each group . CONCLUSION Social networking communities are acceptable and effective tools to increase home-based HIV testing among at-risk population s.

However , compliance with this lifelong dietary regimen is often poor . In the current investigation male and female adults with diagnosed Type II diabetes were r and omly assigned to either a behavior modification , a cognitive modification , a cognitive-behavior modification , or a control group . Patients were evaluated in terms of weight , percentage of body fat , and glycosylated hemoglobin measures . Men lost signficantly more weight than women and subjects in the behavior modification group lost more weight and demonstrated greater decreases in diabetes control than subjects in the cognitive-behavior modification , cognitive , and control groups . A significant interaction indicated that diabetic men may benefit more from  behavioral weight reduction programs  than diabetic women . Several explanations for these findings are considered', 'BACKGROUND Previous findings are unclear regarding the possible glycemic benefits of applying behavioral relaxation training in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus ( NIDDM ) . METHODS Subjects with NIDDM were r and omized to relaxation training ( 6 sessions of progressive muscle relaxation and imagery , n = 12 ) or control treatment ( routine medical care , n = 10 ) . Physiological measures were total glycosylated hemoglobin ( GHb ) and area under the 2-hour oral-glucose-tolerance curve ( AUC ) . Psychological measures of generalized distress , anxiety and daily stress were also administered . All subjects were assessed before and after the 8-week intervention , and again at 16 weeks of long-term follow-up . RESULTS There were no postintervention group differences in physiological variables . Highly distressed subjects and those who rated their glucose as more stress responsive tended to practice relaxation less between sessions . Within the treated group only , lower preintervention stress responsivity was associated with greater improvement in GHb , and lower anxiety and distress levels predicted long-term improvement in AUC . CONCLUSIONS It remains unclear whether relaxation training produces glycemic benefits in NIDDM . Perhaps the least anxious and stress-responsive patients only benefit from group-based relaxation training , whereas anxious individuals require intensive individually administered interventions', 'OBJECTIVE There is conflicting evidence regarding the utility of stress management training in the treatment of diabetes . The few studies that have shown a therapeutic effect of stress management have used time-intensive individual therapy . Unfortunately , widespread use of such interventions is not practical . The aim of the present investigation is to determine whether a cost-effective , group-based stress management training program can improve glucose metabolism in patients with type 2 diabetes and to determine whether a particular subset of patients is more likely to get positive results . RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Patients with type 2 diabetes were r and omized to undergo a five-session group diabetes education program with or without stress management training .  Participants ( n = 108 ) were followed for 1 year , during which HbA(1c ) tests and question naires assessing perceived stress , anxiety , and psychological health were administered at regular intervals to evaluate treatment effects . RESULTS Stress management training was associated with a small ( 0.5 % ) but significant reduction in HbA(1c ) . Compliance with the treatment regimen decreased over time but was similar to that seen in patients receiving stress management for other reasons in the clinic . Trait anxiety ( a measure of stable individual differences in anxiety proneness ) did not predict response to treatment , showing that highly anxious patients did not derive more benefit from training . CONCLUSIONS The current results indicate that a cost-effective , group stress management program in a \\\" real-world \\\" setting can result in clinical ly significant benefits for patients with type 2 diabetes', 'OBJECTIVE The aim of this r and omized pilot study was to examine whether the addition of motivational interviewing strategies to a behavioral obesity intervention enhances adherence and glucose control in older obese women with NIDDM . RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Twenty-two older obese women ( 41 % black ) with NIDDM were r and omly assigned to 1 ) a st and ard 16-week group behavioral weight-control program that provided instruction in diet , exercise , and behavioral modification or 2 ) the same group behavioral program with three individualized motivational interviewing sessions added . RESULTS The motivational group attended significantly more group meetings ( 13.3 vs. 8.9 ) , completed significantly more food diaries ( 15.2 vs. 10.1 ) , and recorded blood glucose significantly more often ( 46.0 vs. 32.2 days ) than the st and ard group . Further , participants in the motivational group had significantly better glucose control post-treatment ( 9.8 vs. 10.8 % ) . Although both groups demonstrated significant weight loss , no differences were apparent between groups . CONCLUSIONS These results suggest that augmenting a st and ard behavioral treatment program for obese women with NIDDM with a motivational interviewing component may significantly enhance adherence to program recommendations and glycemic control . Preliminary data warrant further investigation with larger sample s and a longer follow-up', 'The present study examined the effects of progressive relaxation training and EMG biofeedback on acute glucose disposal in diabetic subjects , as measured by glucose tolerance and three other measures of diabetic metabolic control . Twenty subjects with non-insulin-using Type II diabetes took part in progressive relaxation training and EMG biofeedback in a pre-post treatment versus wait-list experimental design . Treatment effects were assessed on glucose tolerance along with three measures of diabetic control : fasting blood glucose , two-hour postpr and ial blood glucose , and fructosamine . Stress reduction and relaxation was assessed with two physiological measures and two subjective question naires . The training program produced significant reductions in stress , as measured by State Anxiety , and significant changes in physiological measures of muscle activity and skin conductance compared to the control condition . However , no changes were found in glucose tolerance ( while practicing relaxation ) nor in any of the three measures of general diabetic metabolic control . The major implication of this study is that relaxation training does not appear to directly improve diabetic control in mildly stressed non-insulin-using Type II diabetic patients', 'OBJECTIVES The aim of the present study was to develop , implement and evaluate a brief intervention to improve adherence to the recommended lifestyle changes for patients with Type 2 diabetes , in particular to help patients to reduce the total amount of fat consumed and to increase lifestyle physical activity levels . DESIGN AND METHOD A brief , tailored lifestyle self-management intervention for patients with Type 2 diabetes was evaluated in a r and omized controlled trial . One hundred participants ( aged 40 - 70 yrs ) completed assessment s at three time points- baseline , three months and one year . Participants were allocated to either an intervention group who received the brief tailored intervention including follow-up telephone calls , or a usual care control group . RESULTS Results indicate that the intervention was successful in helping patients to reduce fat intake and , to a lesser extent , increase lifestyle physical activity levels . These self-reported changes in behaviour were reflected in the objective data with weight maintenance in the intervention group compared to the control group , together with a significant reduction ( 2 cm ) in waist circumference . CONCLUSIONS These results provide further evidence of the effectiveness of tailored interventions for lifestyle change', 'OBJECTIVE Because of other competing priorities ,  physical activity ( PA ) is seldom addressed in a consistent way in either primary care or diabetes education . This 8-week pilot study evaluated the short-term benefits of an Internet-based supplement to usual care that focused on providing support for sedentary patients with type 2 diabetes to increase their PA levels . RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS A total of 78 type 2 diabetic patients ( 53 % female , average age 52.3 years ) were r and omized to the Diabetes Network ( D-Net ) Active Lives PA Intervention or an Internet information-only condition .  The intervention condition received goal - setting and personalized feedback , identified and developed strategies to overcome barriers , received and could post messages to an on-line \\\" personal coach , \\\" and were invited to participate in peer group support areas . Key outcomes included minutes of PA per week and depressive symptomatology . RESULTS There was an overall moderate improvement in PA levels within both intervention and control conditions , but there was no significant improvement in regard to condition effects . There was substantial variability in both site use and outcomes within the intervention and control conditions . Internal analyses revealed that among intervention participants , those who used the site more regularly derived significantly greater benefits , whereas those in the control condition derived no similar benefits with increased program use . CONCLUSIONS Internet-based self-management interventions for  PA and other regimen areas have great potential to enhance the care of diabetes and other chronic conditions . We conclude that greater attention should be focused on methods to sustain involvement with Internet-based intervention health promotion programs over time', 'The aim of this study was to compare the effects of an intensive educational approach incorporating longer time , greater simplicity , repetition , and cognitive motivational techniques with a conventional one in subjects with established non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus ( NIDDM ) whose weight , glycemic control , and diet were not optimal . Subjects were r and omly allocated to intensive or conventional education .  Of 350 subjects , 70 met the study criteria , which included established NIDDM ( \\u22653 mo ) , suboptimal recent glycemic control , dietary fat intake \\u226535 % of total energy intake , and body massindex \\u226525 kg/m2 . The intensive approach was associated with significantly greater improvements in dietary compliance , dietary intake ( complex carbohydrate , [ P = 0.013 ] , legumes [ P < 0.0001 ] , fiber [ P < 0.0001 ] , total fat [ P < 0.004 ] , saturated fat [ P < 0.004 ] ) , and total cholesterol level ( P = 0.007 ) . The transient improvement in glycemic control was similar in both groups . An intensive education program can improve dietary compliance in established NIDDM subjects more than a conventional one . These recommended dietary improvements achieve better improvement in total cholesterol but do not necessarily improve glycemic control', 'The specificity and magnitude of the effects of cognitive behavior therapy in the treatment of bulimia nervosa were evaluated . Seventy-five patients who met strict diagnostic criteria were treated with either cognitive behavior therapy , a simplified behavioral version of this treatment , or interpersonal psychotherapy . Assessment was by interview and self-report question naire , and many aspects of functioning were evaluated . All three treatments result ed in an improvement in the measures of the psychopathology .  Cognitive behavior therapy was more effective than  interpersonal psychotherapy  in modifying the disturbed attitudes to shape and weight , extreme attempts to diet , and self-induced vomiting .  Cognitive behavior therapy was more effective than  behavior therapy in modifying the disturbed attitudes to shape and weight and extreme dieting , but it was equivalent in other respects . The findings suggest that cognitive behavior therapy , when applied to patients with bulimia nervosa , operates through mechanisms specific to this treatment and is more effective than both interpersonal psychotherapy and a simplified behavioral version of cognitive behavior therapy', 'In this r and omized trial patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes were allocated to one of four programs : a minimal instruction program ( n=59 ) . an education program of individual visits ( n=57 ) , an education program incorporating a group education course ( n=66 ) , and a behavioral program ( n=59 ) . Individual and group education programs had higher attrition rates than the behavioral and minimal programs . The four programs , which involved different amounts of patient contact time , delivery format , and instructional strategies . all produced reductions in HbA atid BMI , with no significant differences between the programs . There were no differences between groups over three time periods in total cholesterol , HDL cholesterol , systolic blood pressure , or proportion of patients consulting an ophthalmologist . The behavioral program ploduced a greater reduction in diastolic blood pressure over 12 months that the education programs and a greater reduction in the cholesterol risk ratio over 3 months than the other programs . The behavioral program patients were more likely to have visited a podiatrist after 6 months and reported higher satisfaction', 'BACKGROUND This study was done to determine the efficacy and ease of administration of education/behavior modification classes , provided by a nurse and a dietitian in a primary care clinic for improving control of type 2 diabetes mellitus .  METHODS Patients were divided r and omly into two groups . Eighteen patients completed 6 months of structured , office-based classes , and 20 similar patients served as control subjects . All were patients of the same group practice and had their usual office visits .  Glycemic control , lipid levels , body weight , knowledge about diabetes , medication requirements , and symptoms were monitored during the 6 months , with follow-up at 12 months . RESULTS At the end of 6 months , the intervention group had significant reductions in mean fasting blood glucose , glycosylated hemoglobin , total cholesterol , and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C ) values . Their mean body weight was significantly reduced at 12 months , and their knowledge of diabetes was improved . Control patients had significant improvement only in glycosylated hemoglobin and body weight at 6 months . Minimal physician time was required . CONCLUSION The education/behavior modification program was clinical ly worthwhile , and it was easy to administer', 'The course of depression in patients with comorbid medical illness is poorly understood . We report a 5-year follow-up study of 25 diabetic patients who had participated in an 8-week depression treatment trial .  When a patient completed the trial , primary physicians were informed of patient outcomes and advised to monitor for relapse and treat those with ongoing depression . At the 5-year reevaluation depression was assessed using DSM-III-R criteria , and a depression severity scale was formed that reflected the presence , severity , frequency , and duration of depression episodes as well as a global assessment of functioning . Recurrence or persistence of depression occurred in 23 ( 92 % ) of the patients with an average of 4.8 depression episodes over the 5-year follow-up period . The duration of the longest episode averaged 16 + /- 4 months . Reversion to major depression occurred frequently and rapidly also in the subset that remitted during the treatment trial : 58.3 % were depressed again within the first year . At the time of the follow-up interview , major depression was evident in 16 ( 64 % ) of the subjects , and glycemic control was significantly worse in this group compared with those without depression ( gHb : 13.3 % + /- 2.6 % vs 11.1 % + /- 1.9 % , P = 0.03 ) . Severity of depression over follow-up was related to the presence of neuropathy at entry and to incomplete remission during the initial treatment trial . Nineteen patients ( 82.6 % of those who relapsed ) received additional courses of antidepressant therapy , but none was treated continuously for depression prophylaxis . In this diabetic sample , depression was a recurrent condition in the vast majority of cases , and initial treatment response did not confer lasting euthymia . Whether maintenance antidepressant medication would be useful in preventing depression recurrence and promoting better glycemic control in diabetes remains to be studied', 'OBJECTIVE To examine the benefits of relaxation training for patients with NIDDM and to investigate individual differences that could predict a positive response to relaxation training . RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Thirty-eight subjects with NIDDM were treated with intensive conventional diabetes therapy after an initial metabolic evaluation and psychological and pharmacological testing . Half were assigned to also receive biofeedback-assisted relaxation training . Treatment effects on GHb levels and glucose tolerance were evaluated after 8 wk . RESULTS Subjects demonstrated significant improvements in GHb level , but not in glucose tolerance , after 8 wk of intensive conventional treatment . These improvements persisted throughout the follow-up period . However , the group provided with relaxation training did not experience greater improvements on either measure than the group given conventional diabetes treatment only . Within the group that received relaxation training , correlations occurred between the improvements in glucose tolerance after treatment and individual differences in trait anxiety and in the effect of alprazolam on glucose tolerance . Differences in the effects of EPI on glucose tolerance and personality measures of neuroticism and perceived locus of control also appeared to be related to improvements in glucose tolerance after training . CONCLUSIONS Relaxation training did not confer added benefit over and above that provided by conventional diabetes treatment for patients with NIDDM . Additional research is needed to determine whether the administration of relaxation training to selected patients , especially those who are most responsive to stress , would provide benefits for glucose control that are not achieved by conventional treatment', \\\"The implication s of behavioral analysis for practice and research have significant potential for nursing . This present study was conducted to determine the effectiveness of nurses and patients actively participating in behavioral analysis and the implementation of behavioral strategies in order to improve the patients ' self-management of their Type H diabetes . Patients ( N = 156 ) were r and omly assigned to one of four groups . The attention control group ( n = 41 ) received routine care . The compliance group ( n = 32 ) agreed to practice compliance behaviors related to the prescribed medical regimen . The behavioral strategies group ( n = 42 ) participated in behavioral analysis and agreed to practice behavioral strategies . The behavioral strategies with instruction group ( n = 41 ) participated in behavioral analysis , agreed to practice behavioral strategies , and received classes and programmed instruction about behavioral analysis and behavioral strategies . There were no outcome differences between groups relative to glycosylated hemoglobin ( GHb ) and weight loss . There were differences in the outcome measures in subgroups by age , gender , and employment , which have practice and research implication s for the individualization of interventions using behavioral strategies\\\", 'The purpose of our study was to compare the effect on diabetes control of group management with the advice-educational technique traditionally used in managing obese out patients with poorly controlled non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus ( NIDDM ) . Forty-one patients were r and omly assigned to these two treatment programs , and 32 patients completed the 6-mo study . Initially , patients were seen for 1-h sessions at 1- and 2-wk intervals and later at 1-mo intervals . Patients were asked to do home blood glucose monitoring , decrease caloric intake , increase exercise , and if they were taking insulin , to adjust the dose to attain approximate euglycemia  and to stabilize food and exercise patterns  . The combined groups reduced mean \\u00b1 SD glycohemoglobin from 10.9 \\u00b1 3.1 to 9.4 \\u00b1 2.4 % ( P < .05 ) . Internal Health Locus of Control Scale was negatively and significantly correlated with initial and subsequent glycohemoglobin values ( the more internal , the lower the glycohemoglobin ) . At the end of the study the patients in the group management program had significantly lower blood glucose levels than those given advice and education , but no significant differences in glycohemoglobin values or percentage overweight were observed . One patient had a normal initial glycohemoglobin , and only 4 patients had values in the normal range of 4\\u20136.8 % at the end of the study . Better management programs need to be developed for treating obese out patients with NIDDM', 'Forty-nine obese diabetic patients with obese spouses ( diabetic or nondiabetic ) were r and omly assigned to an alone or together condition . Patients in the alone group participated by themselves in a 20-week behavioral weight control program ; their spouses attended assessment sessions only . Patients in the together group attended the program with their spouses ; both were targeted for weight loss and taught social support strategies .  Weight losses of patients treated alone and together did not differ significantly at posttreatment ( 19.9 vs. 19.1 lb ) or 1-year follow-up ( 11.6 vs. 7.0 lb ) . However , there was a significant interaction of treatment and gender ; women did better when treated with their spouses , whereas men did better when treated alone . A \\\" family-based \\\" approach was not effective for these obese Type II diabetic patients as a whole but may be helpful for women', 'To determine whether a group behavior modification approach might be preferable to individual counseling in the nutritional therapy of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus , 40 adults younger than 65 yr of age with diabetes mellitus who were not receiving insulin were r and omized to either a program of individualized dietary review and recommendations or a program of group meetings aim ed at controlling the signals leading to overeating and noncompliance with a diabetic dietary regimen . Statistically significant ( P < 0.05 ) decreases in body weight , sum skin-fold thickness , fasting serum glucose , and serum triglycerides but not LDL-C or HDL-C were observed . The individual counseling group had a greater amount of weight loss than the behavior modification group . There were no significant ( P < 0.05 ) differences between the two groups with respect to the biochemical outcome variables . Patient characteristics assessed at entry \\u2014 namely anxiety , internal versus external locus of control and perceived disease severity , and compliance with advice \\u2014 were significantly associated with weight loss in the behavior modification group while only the latter index was of value in the individual counseling group . Thus , our use of these programs does not identify a clear advantage of either approach in the nutritional therapy of non-insulin-dependent diabetic patients', 'Aims This preliminary study addresses three related issues . First , there is a need to test the effectiveness of cognitive behavioural therapy ( CBT ) for binge eating in population s with Type 2 diabetes . Second , the impact of a treatment for binge eating on diabetes management is unknown . Finally , whilst a number of treatment modalities have been shown to improve binge eating , there has not been a comparison between CBT and a non-specific therapy for binge eating . Methods Group CBT for binge eating was compared with a group non-prescriptive therapy ( NPT ) , a therapy for which there is no theoretical or empirical support in eating disorders , in a r and omized trial which included a post-treatment assessment and a 3-month follow-up . Results There were no differences between CBT and NPT at post-treatment , with both treatments being associated with significant changes in binge eating , mood and body mass index . However , there was a significant relapse in binge eating at the 3-month follow-up in the NPT condition . This was in contrast to the CBT condition , where treatment gains were maintained . Finally , across treatments , reduction in binge eating from pre- to post-treatment was associated with reduction in HbA(1c ) . Conclusions Binge eating in Type 2 diabetes is responsive to psychosocial treatment , and reduction in binge eating appears to improve glycaemic control . However , this is a small study with a short follow-up period . Future studies will need to extend the follow-up period to assess for long-term maintenance of the effects of CBT on binge eating and diabetic control in this population', 'BACKGROUND Psychotherapy is the principal nonpharmacologic method for the management of depression , but its usefulness for depressed patients with diabetes remains unknown . OBJECTIVE To assess the efficacy of cognitive behavior therapy ( CBT ) for depression in patients with diabetes . DESIGN R and omized , controlled trial . SETTING Referral-based academic medical center . PATIENTS 51 patients with type 2 diabetes and major depression . INTERVENTION Patients were assigned either to a group that received 10 weeks of individual CBT or to a control group that received no specific antidepressant treatment . All patients participated in a diabetes education program to control for the effects of supportive attention and the possible influence of enhanced diabetes control on mood . MEASUREMENTS Degree of depression was measured by using the Beck Depression Inventory ; glycemic control was measured by using glycosylated hemoglobin levels . Outcomes were assessed immediately after treatment and 6 months after treatment . RESULTS The percentage of patients achieving remission of depression ( Beck Depression Inventory score < or = 9 ) was greater in the CBT group than in the control group : posttreatment , 85.0 % of patients in the CBT group ( 17 of 20 ) compared with 27.3 % of controls ( 6 of 22 ) achieved remission ( difference , 57.7 percentage points [ 95 % CI , 33 to 82 percentage points ] ) ( P < 0.001 ) ; at follow-up , 70.0 % of patients in the CBT group ( 14 of 20 ) compared with 33.3 % of controls ( 7 of 21 ) achieved remission ( difference , 36.7 percentage points [ CI , 9 to 65 percentage points ] ) ( P = 0.03 ) . Post-treatment glycosylated hemoglobin levels were not different in the two groups , but follow-up mean glycosylated hemoglobin levels were significantly better in the CBT group than in the control group ( 9.5 % compared with 10.9 % ; P = 0.03 ) . CONCLUSIONS The combination of CBT and supportive diabetes education is an effective nonpharmacologic treatment for major depression in patients with type 2 diabetes . It may also be associated with improved glycemic control']\",\n          \"['To compare the use of  r and omized controls ( RCTs ) and historical controls ( HCTs )  for clinical trials , we search ed the literature for therapies studied by both methods . We found six therapies for which 50 RCTs and 56 HCTs were reported . Forty-four of 56 HCTs  ( 79 percent ) found the therapy better than the control regimen , but only 10 of 50 RCTs ( 20 percent ) agreed . For each therapy , the treated patients in RCTs and HCTs of the same therapy was largely due to differences in outcome for the control groups , with HCT control patients generally doing worse than the RCT control groups . Adjustment of the outcomes of the HCTs for prognostic factors , when possible , did not appreciably change the results . The data suggest that biases in patient selection may irretrievably weight the outcome of HCts in favor of new therapies . RCTs may miss clinical ly important benefits because of inadequate attention to sample size . The predictive value of each might be improved by reconsidering the use of p less than 0.05 as the significance level for all types of clinical trials , and by the use of confidence intervals around estimates of treatment effects', 'A clinical trial , aim ed at secondary prevention of low-back pain , was performed in 142 hospital employees reporting at least three annual episodes of this condition . Participants were r and omly assigned to one of three groups : a calisthenics program ( CAL ) for 3 months with biweekly sessions of flexion exercises , a back school program ( 5 sessions ) , and a control group . The effectiveness of the two intervention programs was evaluated over a 1-year period . Baseline preintervention data and evaluation at the end of 3 months of intervention and after an additional 6 months were collected . A monthly surveillance for the whole year showed a mean of 4.5 \\u201c painful months \\u201d in the CAL group versus 7.3 and 7.4 months in the back school and control groups , respectively ( P < 0.0001 ) . The superiority of the CAL group was achieved partly because of the significant increase in trunk forward flexion and to initial increment in abdominal muscle strength . The increased trunk flexion was associated with the rate of participation in the CAL sessions . Further research is needed to answer the question of \\u201c intensity versus type of exercise \\u201d by comparing different intervention programs , with similar intensity', 'Study Design . The study was carried out as an open , r and omized , multicenter , parallel\\u2010group study with an observation period of 12 months . Four Norwegian physiotherapy institutes took part . Patients were subsequently followed for 12 months of home exercise on their own , without the supervision of a physiotherapist . Objectives . 1 ) To investigate and compare the effects of two different exercise programs on low back problems in patients after a 1\\u2010year training program under the supervision of a physiotherapist . 2 ) To investigate the effect supervision by , and motivation from , physiotherapists has on training compliance and efficacy . Summary of Background Data . After ordinary physiotherapy treatment for low back problems , patients were r and omly allocated either to a conventional training program design ed by physiotherapists or to a training program using a new Norwegian\\u2010developed training apparatus called the TerapiMaster . The study included 153 patients with low back problems , all of whom had been referred to physiotherapy by their general practitioners . One hundred twenty\\u2010six patients were followed for an additional 12 months when performing home exercise programs on their own . Methods . Monitoring patient satisfaction with the training program , compliance with the program , and absenteeism from work during the training period . Results . Patient satisfaction with both training programs was high , with about 83 % of participating patients completing the study in accordance with the protocol . Mean absenteeism ( SD ) during the preceding year totaled 82.5 days ( 19.8 ) in the conventional training group and 61.6 days ( 14.7 ) in the TerapiMaster group . Significant reductions to 17.2 days ( 6.0 ) and 15.4 days ( 5.3 ) in the two groups , respectively , were recorded during the training period , corresponding to a 75 % to 80 % reduction compared with the preceding 1\\u2010year period . Mean absenteeism showed a further significant decline during the 12\\u2010month period without supervised training . The average values were 9.9 days ( 3.2 ) for conventional training and 9.3 days ( 3.1 ) for the TerapiMaster , respectively . Conclusions . Both exercise programs reduced absenteeism significantly ( 75\\u201080 % ) . No difference in the effects of the two different programs was discernible . Regular follow\\u2010up through encouragement and variation in the training programs appear to be important factors for motivating patients to adhere to regular exercise programs for low back problems . This thesis was corroborated by the 12\\u2010month study of unsupervised exercise', 'CONTEXT Low back pain is a frequent and costly health problem . Prevention of low back pain is important both for the individual patient and from an economic perspective . OBJECTIVE To assess the efficacy of lumbar supports and education in the prevention of low back pain in industry . DESIGN A r and omized controlled trial with a factorial design . SETTING The cargo department of an airline company in the Netherl and s. PARTICIPANTS A total of 312 workers were r and omized , of whom 282 were available for the 6-month follow-up . INTERVENTIONS Subjects were r and omly assigned to 4 groups : ( 1 ) education ( lifting instructions ) and lumbar support , ( 2 ) education , ( 3 ) lumbar support , and ( 4 ) no intervention . Education consisted of 3 group sessions on lifting techniques with a total duration of 5 hours . Lumbar supports were recommended to be used during working hours for 6 months . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Low back pain incidence and sick leave because of back pain during the 6-month intervention period . RESULTS Compliance with wearing the lumbar support at least half the time was 43 % . In the 282 subjects for whom data were available , no statistically significant differences in back pain incidence ( 48 [ 36 % ] of 134 with lumbar support vs 51 [ 34 % ] of 148 without , P=.81 ) or in sick leave because of low back pain ( mean , 0.4 days per month with lumbar support vs 0.4 days without , P=.52 ) were found among the intervention groups . In a subgroup of subjects with low back pain at baseline , lumbar supports reduced the number of days with low back pain per month ( median , 1.2 vs 6.5 days per month ; P=.03 ) . CONCLUSIONS Overall , lumbar supports or education did not lead to a reduction in low back pain incidence or sick leave . The results of the subgroup analysis need to be confirmed by future research . Based on our results , the use of education or lumbar supports can not be recommended in the prevention of low back pain in industry', 'We analysed 113 reports published in 1980 in a sample of medical journals to relate features of study design to the magnitude of gains attributed to new therapies over old . Overall we rated 87 per cent of new therapies as improvements over st and ard therapies . The mean gain ( measured by the Mann-Whitney statistic ) was relatively constant across study design s , except for non-r and omized controlled trials with sequential assignment to therapy , which showed a significantly higher likelihood that a patient would do better on the innovation than on st and ard therapy ( p = 0.004 ) . R and omized controlled trials that did not use a double-blind design had a higher likelihood of showing a gain for the innovation than did double-blind trials ( p = 0.02 ) . Any evaluation of an innovation may include both bias and the true efficacy of the new therapy , therefore we may consider making adjustments for the average bias associated with a study design . When interpreting an evaluation of a new therapy , readers should consider the impact of the following average adjustments to the Mann-Whitney statistic : for trials with non-r and om sequential assignment a decrease of 0.15 , for non-double-blind r and omized controlled trials a decrease of 0.11', 'The aim of the present controlled study was to evaluate the effect of a general fitness program , performed by an occupational health service , using pre-post assessment for a number of different outcome measures . A total of 160 employees working in the central home care service district of Ume\\u00e5 , Sweden were asked to participate in a program of a 1-year long exercise program . Of the 160 selected , 54 subjects declined to participate and nine subjects were rejected after a medical check up . The remaining 97 subjects participated in a schedule consisting of pre-post medical and physiotherapy examinations , question naires concerning sociodemography , musculoskeletal and general health complaints and work environment , physiological tests of cardiovascular fitness , and of strength and endurance of shoulder flexors and knee extensors , and registration of sick leave . The subjects were r and omly assigned to an exercise ( treatment ) or control group . The exercise group trained twice a week for 1 year using a mixed program including exercises for coordination , strength/endurance , and fitness . The test schedule was repeated for both groups after 1 year . The exercise intervention was associated with positive changes in prevalence and intensity of musculoskeletal and psychosomatic complaints , better physiotherapy status ( less muscle tightness , better neck mobility , and less tender points ) , increased shoulder strength and increased coordination in thigh muscles . However , the exercise group reported worse situations post-exercise concerning aspects of their physical and psychosocial work-environment ( i.e. , concerning ergonomy , influence , appreciation and communication with work manager ) , which might have been due to stress associated with the exercise situation', 'Most systematic review s rely substantially on the assessment of the method ological quality of the individual trials . The aim of this study was to obtain consensus among experts about a set of generic core items for quality assessment of r and omized clinical trials ( RCTs ) . The invited participants were experts in the field of quality assessment of RCTs . The initial item pool contained all items from existing criteria lists . Subsequently , we reduced the number of items by using the Delphi consensus technique . Each Delphi round comprised a question naire , an analysis , and a feedback report . The feedback report included staff team decisions made on the basis of the analysis and their justification . A total of 33 international experts agreed to participate , of whom 21 completed all question naires . The initial item pool of 206 items was reduced to 9 items in three Delphi rounds . The final criteria list ( the Delphi list ) was satisfactory to all participants . It is a starting point on the way to a minimum reference st and ard for RCTs on many different research topics . This list is not intended to replace , but rather to be used alongside , existing criteria lists', 'Back-related injuries have become a major health problem in the workplace , affecting as many as 35 percent of the work force and accounting for about 25 percent of all compensation cl aims . This study evaluates a back injury prevention program  among employees in a northern California county in 1989 - 90 . Six divisions of the county government were selected for the study because they had the highest prevalence of back pain experienced and the most back-related injuries in recent years . Four of the six divisions were r and omly selected as the intervention group and the remaining two , the  control group . Overall , 77 percent or 205 of the targeted employees in the intervention group participated in the study . The intervention group was given an identical health risk assessment ( HRA ) before and after the 1-year back injury prevention program that offered employees a combination of education , training , physical fitness activities , and ergonomic improvement . The control group was neither given the HRA nor offered the program . The back injury and cost data of both the control and intervention groups were collected before and after the 1-year intervention . The results showed a modest overall decline in back pain prevalence rates , but significant improvement in satisfaction and reduction in risky behaviors . Cost-benefit analysis showed the net benefit of introducing back injury prevention program was $ 161,108 , and the return on investment is 179 percent . Therefore , the study offers suggestive evidence for the initial benefits of a back injury prevention program and lends support to the widely held belief that health promotion in the workplace can reduce employee health risks , increase healthful behaviors and attitudes , and improve attitudes toward the employer organization . Whether such intervention will continue to reap benefits in future years depends , to a large extent , on a favorable work environment and the maintenance and continuation of positive behavioral changes', 'This study was design ed to determine which method of instruction in body mechanics results in the higher subsequent use of the techniques taught . Two groups were formed from nursing personnel at a rural general medical-surgical hospital in the southwestern United States . Subjects from the direct care nursing staff were r and omly assigned to one of the two groups . One group attended two hours of classroom instruction in body mechanics , while the other completed an independent study module . Subjects were pre- and posttested using the Work-Related Body Mechanics Evaluation ( Carlton , 1987 ) while performing a st and ardized lifting task in the clinical setting . Using analysis of covariance , no significant differences were found in the posttest scores of the two groups', \\\"This study was funded in part by NIH grant AR36308 The authors thank the employees of the United States Postal Service and the American Postal Workers Union ( APWU ) , Boston Metro Area Local , and Maith and lers Local 301 for their help and cooperation ; therapists from the Department of Rehabilitation Services , Bngham and Women 's Hospital for help in training workers ; and Ms Nancy Tanner for\\\", \\\"BACKGROUND Low back injuries are common and costly , accounting for 15 to 25 percent of injuries covered by workers ' compensation and 30 to 40 percent of the payments made under that program . The high costs of injury , the lack of effective treatment . and the evidence that there are behavioral risk factors have led to widespread use of employee education programs that teach safe lifting and h and ling . The effectiveness of those programs , however , has received little rigorous evaluation . METHODS We evaluated an educational program design ed to prevent low back injury in a r and omized , controlled trial involving about 4000 postal workers . The program , similar to that in wide use in so-called back schools , was taught by experienced physical therapists . Work units of workers and supervisors were trained in a two-session back school ( three hours of training ) , followed by three to four reinforcement sessions over the succeeding few years . Injured subjects ( from both the intervention and the control groups ) were r and omized a second time to receive either training or no training after their return to work . RESULTS Physical therapists trained 2534 postal workers and 134 supervisors . Over 5.5 years of follow-up , 360 workers reported low back injuries , for a rate of 21.2 injuries per 1000 worker-years of risk . The median time off from work per injury was 14 days ( range , 0 to 1717 ) ; the median cost was $ 204 ( range , zero to $ 190,380 ) . After their return to work , 75 workers were injured again . Our comparison of the intervention and control groups found that the education program did not reduce the rate of low back injury , the median cost per injury , the time off from work per injury , the rate of related musculoskeletal injuries , or the rate of repeated injury after return to work ; only the subjects ' knowledge of safe behavior was increased by the training . CONCLUSIONS A large-scale , r and omized , controlled trial of an educational program to prevent work-associated low back injury found no long-term benefits associated with training\\\", '& NA ; The current investigation studied the effectiveness of a secondary prevention program for nurses with back pain who were deemed at risk for developing a chronic problem . A 2 \\u00d7 3 repeated measures design was employed with 2 groups and 3 assessment periods . The treatment group received an intervention design ed to reduce current problems , but above all to prevent reinjury and minor pains from becoming chronic medical problems , and it included a physical and behavioral therapy package . The control group was placed on a waiting\\u2010list . Results indicated that the treatment group had significantly greater improvements than the control group for pain intensity , anxiety , sleep quality and fatigue ratings , observed pain behavior , activities , mood , and helplessness . These differences were generally maintained at the 6 month follow\\u2010up . In addition , the treatment group broke a trend for increasing amounts of pain\\u2010related absenteeism , while the control group did not . Taken as a whole , the results suggest that a secondary prevention program aim ed at altering life style factors may represent an effective method for dealing with musculoskeletal pain problems', 'This study was design ed to determine the effect of multimodal intervention and the prevention of back injury , and to evaluate the adverse side effects of using a lumbosacral corset in the workplace . Subjects were 90 male warehouse workers r and omly selected from over 800 employees at a grocery distribution center . Subjects were assigned to three groups : true controls , no back school , no brace orthoses ; back school only ; and back school plus wearing a custom molded lumbosacral orthosis . Comparisons of pre-testing and 6-month follow-up posttesting for abdominal strength , cognitive data , work injury incidence and productivity and use of health care services were evaluated . Controls and training-only group showed no changes in strength productivity or lost time . Orthoses and training-group showed no changes in strength productivity or accident rate ; however , they showed substantially less lost time . This study supports the concept of using education and prophylactic bracing to prevent back injury and reduce time loss . It appears that the use of intermittent prophylactic bracing has no adverse affects on abdominal muscle strength and may contribute to decreased lost time from work injuries', 'The personnel at a geriatric hospital were r and omized into two groups . One group was allowed to exercise during working hours to improve back muscle strength , endurance , and coordination . The other group did not participate in the exercise program and received no further advice or information . After 13 months , the training group had increased back muscle strength . One subject had been absent from work 28 days in the training group whereas 12 subjects had been absent 155 days from work because of low back pain in the control group ( P<0.004 ) . The back pain complaints and intensity of back pain in the training group also decreased in a statistically significant way . Every hour spent by the physiotherapist on the training group reduced the work absence among the participants by 1.3 days , result ing in a cost/benefit ratio greater than 10', \\\"We analysed the results of 221 comparisons of an innovation with a st and ard treatment in surgery published in six leading surgery journals in 1983 to relate features of study design to the magnitude of gain . For each comparison we measured the gain attributed to the innovation over the st and ard therapy by the Mann-Whitney statistic and the difference in proportion of treatment successes . For primary treatments ( aim ed at curing or ameliorating a patient 's principal disease ) , an average gain of 0.56 was produced by 20 r and omized controlled trials . This was less than the 0.62 average for four non-r and omized controlled trials , 0.63 for 19 externally controlled trials , and 0.57 for 73 record review s ( 0.50 represents a toss-up between innovation and st and ard ) . For secondary therapies ( used to prevent or treat complications of therapy ) , the average gain was 0.53 for 61 r and omized controlled trials , 0.58 for eleven non-r and omized controlled trials , 0.54 for eight externally controlled trials , and 0.55 for 18 record review s. Readers of studies evaluating new treatments , particularly for primary treatments , may consider adjustment of the gain according to the study type\\\", \\\"Thirty food service workers were r and omly assigned to two groups ; one group received body mechanics instruction while the other did not . The application of the instruction was measured by evaluating the subjects ' use of body mechanics on a novel lifting and lowering task and during performance on the job . Results indicated that the group which received instruction performed significantly better on the novel task than the group that received no instruction . However , no significant difference between groups was found in performance in the work environment . The role of the occupational therapist in a work-related safety program is also discussed\\\", 'The purpose s of this study were to evaluate the effect of a weekly exercise program on  short-term sick leave ( less than 50 days ) attributable to back pain and to determine whether changes in absenteeism were related to changes in cardiovascular fitness . Subjects were r and omly assigned to an exercise group ( n = 58 ) and a control group ( n = 53 ) .  Sick leave attributable to back pain was determined in the intervention period of 1 1/2 years and a comparable 1 1/2-year period prior to the study . In the exercise group , the number of episodes of back pain and the number of sick-leave days attributable to back pain in the intervention period decreased by over 50 % . Absenteeism attributable to back pain increased in the control group . The decrease in sick leave in the exercise group was not accompanied by any change in cardiovascular fitness . Suggestions for establishing exercise programs are given', \\\"Thirty young workers ( aged 14 to 19 years ) employed as groundskeepers and custodians were r and omly assigned to two groups ; one group received body mechanics instruction and the other did not . The instruction focused on proper spinal alignment in the work environment . Instruction on  low back pain  began with one classroom session before the subjects ' first day of work and continued during employment with two on-site sessions . The effect of instruction was evaluated through the observation of body mechanics during actual work performance . The results of the study indicate that the group that received instruction performed significantly better than the control group . This paper also discusses the occupational therapist 's role in providing job-specific  body mechanics instruction in the work environment as a primary method of preventing low back pain\\\"]\",\n          \"[\\\"OBJECTIVES Although most infants born prematurely do not have major developmental problems , those with perinatal medical problems and lengthy stays in the neonatal intensive care unit are at risk for sensory modulation problems and developmental sequelae . This study compared sensory responsiveness in preterm and full-term infants and examined the relationship of sensory responsiveness to temperament and developmental function . METHOD Caregivers of infants with ( n = 45 ) and without ( n = 22 ) prematurity were asked to complete the  Sensory Rating Scale .  The preterm infants were also evaluated with the Bayley Scales of Infant Development , Second Edition ( BSID-II ) . RESULTS The preterm infants exhibited more frequent behaviors indicating tactile defensiveness and difficult temperament than did the full-term infants . When specific items were examined , the preterm infants displayed sensory-seeking behaviors and high activity levels . As measured by caregivers ' report , sensory responsiveness was significantly related to temperament . It was not related to BSID-II Mental and Psychomotor scale scores . CONCLUSION This study supports the findings of others that preterm infants have mild problems in sensory responsiveness and temperament . Correlational results do not support a definitive relationship between parents ' reports of their infants ' sensory responsiveness and developmental function\\\", \\\"OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effects of the Infant Behavioral Assessment and Intervention Program ( \\u00a9 ) ( IBAIP ) in very low birth weight infants on sensory processing and daily activities at preschool age . STUDY DESIGN Follow-up of children included in a r and omized controlled trial . Eighty-six infants were enrolled in post-discharge IBAIP until 6 months corrected age , and 90 infants received st and ard care .  At 3.5 years of age , the  Sensory Profile-Dutch version ( SP-NL ) and Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory-Dutch version ( PEDI-NL ) were administered . For comparison , parents of 41 term-born children also completed the SP-NL . RESULTS Seventy-six children ( 88 % ) in the IBAIP group and 75 children ( 83 % ) children in the control group were examined at 44 months corrected age . After adjustment for pre-r and omization differences in perinatal characteristics , the IBAIP group outperformed the control group significantly on SP-NL domains of oral sensory processing and sensory processing related to endurance/tone and PEDI-NL domains of mobility . The control group only scored significantly lower than the term group on the SP-NL domain endurance/tone . The very low birth weight groups performed significantly below the PEDI-NL 's norm . CONCLUSION In line with the positive developmental effects of the IBAIP until 24 months corrected age , independency in mobility in daily activities was improved at 3.5 years\\\", 'Abstract Alterations in neural activity due to pain and injury in early development may produce long\\u2010term effects on sensory processing and future responses to pain . To investigate persistent alterations in sensory perception , we performed quantitative sensory testing ( QST ) in extremely preterm ( EP ) children ( n = 43 ) recruited from the UK EPICure cohort ( born less than 26 weeks gestation in 1995 ) and in age and sex matched term\\u2010born controls ( TC ; n = 44 ) . EP children had a generalized decreased sensitivity to all thermal modalities , but no difference in mechanical sensitivity at the thenar eminence . EP children who also required neonatal surgery had more marked thermal hypoalgesia , but did not differ from non\\u2010surgical EP children in the measures of neonatal brain injury or current cognitive ability . Adjacent to neonatal thoracotomy scars there was a localized decrease in both thermal and mechanical sensitivity that differed from EP children with scars relating to less invasive procedural interventions or from those without scars . No relationship was found between sensory perception thresholds and current pain experience or pain coping styles in EP or TC children . Neonatal care and surgery in EP children are associated with persistent modality\\u2010specific changes in sensory processing . Decreases in mechanical and thermal sensitivity adjacent to scars may be related to localized tissue injury , whereas generalized decreases in thermal sensitivity but not in mechanical sensitivity suggest central ly mediated alterations in the modulation of C\\u2010fibre nociceptor pathways , which may impact on responses to future pain or surgery', 'Although many perinatal factors have been linked to adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes in very premature infants , much of the variation in outcome remains unexplained . The impact on brain development of 1 potential factor , exposure to stressors in the neonatal intensive care unit , has not yet been studied in a systematic , prospect i ve manner', \\\"OBJECTIVE To investigate the effects of early experience on brain function and structure . METHODS A r and omized clinical trial tested the neurodevelopmental effectiveness of the Newborn Individualized Developmental Care and Assessment Program ( NIDCAP ) .  Thirty preterm infants , 28 to 33 weeks ' gestational age ( GA ) at birth and free of known developmental risk factors , participated in the trial . NIDCAP was initiated within 72 hours of intensive care unit admission and continued to the age of 2 weeks , corrected for prematurity . Control ( 14 ) and experimental ( 16 ) infants were assessed at 2 weeks ' and 9 months ' corrected age on health status , growth , and neurobehavior , and at 2 weeks ' corrected age additionally on electroencephalogram spectral coherence , magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging , and measurements of transverse relaxation time . RESULTS The groups were medically and demographically comparable before as well as after the treatment . However , the experimental group showed significantly better neurobehavioral functioning , increased coherence between frontal and a broad spectrum of mainly occipital brain regions , and higher relative anisotropy in left internal capsule , with a trend for right internal capsule and frontal white matter . Transverse relaxation time showed no difference . Behavioral function was improved also at 9 months ' corrected age . The relationship among the 3 neurodevelopmental domains was significant . The results indicated consistently better function and more mature fiber structure for experimental infants compared with their controls . CONCLUSIONS This is the first in vivo evidence of enhanced brain function and structure due to the NIDCAP . The study demonstrates that quality of experience before term may influence brain development significantly\\\", 'After birth , preterm infants face a stressful environment , which may negatively impact early brain development and subsequent neurobehavioral outcomes . This r and omized controlled trial involving 45 women with infants < 30-wk gestation , assessed the effectiveness of training parents  in reducing stressful experiences . Intervention consisted of 10 sessions in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit ( NICU ) . Postintervention , at term-equivalent ( 40-wk postmenstrual age ) , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) was performed to evaluate brain structure and development . Quantitative volumetric techniques were used to estimate overall and regional brain volumes for different tissue types including CSF , CGM , DNGM , UWM , and MWM . DTI was used to evaluate the integrity and maturation of white matter by ADC and FA . Maturation and connectivity of white matter , characterized by diffusion MR measures of ADC and FA , were significantly enhanced in the intervention group , who displayed greater restriction in ADC and increase in FA . There were no significant effects on either brain volumes or on short-term medical outcomes . Thus , sensitivity training for parents in the NICU is associated with improved cerebral white matter micro-structural development in preterm infants', \\\"OBJECTIVE To investigate the effectiveness of individualized developmental care in reducing medical and neurodevelopmental sequelae for very low-birth-weight infants . DESIGN R and omized controlled trial . SETTING Newborn intensive care unit . PATIENTS Thirty-eight singleton preterm infants , free of known congenital abnormalities , weighing less than 1250 g , born before 30 weeks ' gestation , mechanically ventilated within 3 hours of delivery and for more than 24 hours in the first 48 hours , r and omly assigned to a control or an experimental group . INTERVENTION Caregiving by nurses specifically trained in individualized developmental care ; observation and documentation of the infants ' behavior within 12 hours of admission , and subsequently every 10th day ; developmental care recommendations and ongoing clinical support for the nurses and parents based on regular observation of the infant by developmental specialists ; and the availability of special caregiving accessories . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Medical outcome , including average daily weight gain ; number of days the infant required mechanical ventilation , oxygen , gavage tube feeding , and hospitalization ; severity of retinopathy of prematurity , bronchopulmonary dysplasia , pneumothorax , and intraventricular hemorrhage ; pediatric complications ; age at discharge ; and hospital charges . Neurodevelopmental outcome , including Assessment of Preterm Infants ' Behavior scale and quantified electroencephalography ( 2 weeks after due date ) ; and Bayley Scales of Infant Development and Kangaroo Box Paradigm ( 9 months after due date ) . RESULTS The infants in the experimental group had a significantly shorter duration of mechanical ventilation and supplemental oxygen support ; earlier oral feeding ; reduced incidence of intraventricular hemorrhage , pneumothorax , and severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia ; improved daily weight gain ; shorter hospital stays ; younger ages at hospital discharge ; and reduced hospital charges compared with the infants in the control group . At 2 weeks after their due date s , these infants also showed improved autonomic regulation , motor system functioning , self-regulatory abilities , and visual evoked potential measures ; and at 9 months , they had improved Bayley Mental and Psychomotor Developmental Index scores , as well as Kangaroo Box Paradigm scores .

The study population includes 124 late preterm infants at gestational age between 34 and 35 6/7 weeks who were born at the same medical center . The control group comprised of 33 term babies ( 18 boys , 15 girls ) , born during the same period and location ( mean age 12.47 , SD = 0.73 ) .  Sensory modulation  was assessed by the test of sensory functions in infants and the infant/toddler sensory profile and for assessment of participation and parents ' satisfaction we used question naires . Term infants had better sensory modulation than LPI . Approximately 10 % of the sensory modulation of participants in the study was explained by gestational age and head circumference .  LPI participation and parental satisfaction decreased in the LPI group . Among all the explanatory variables only multiple gestations and head circumference contributed to the explained variance of participation ( 16 % ) , and parents ' satisfaction ( 13 % ) . At age of 1 year , children born as late preterm are at increased risk of developing sensory modulation disorder , showing less participation , and result ing in less parental satisfaction\\\", 'Background Sensory experience is the basis for learning in infancy . In older children , abnormal sensory reactivity is associated with behavioural and developmental disorders . We hypothesised that in preterm infants , abnormal sensory reactivity during infancy would be associated with perinatal characteristics and correlate with 2-year neurodevelopmental outcomes . Methods We conducted a prospect i ve observational study of infants with birth weight \\u22641500 g using the Test of Sensory Function in Infants ( TSFI ) in the first year . Infants with gestational age \\u226430 weeks were tested with the  Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development III ( BSID III ) at 24 months . Results Of the 72 participants evaluated at 4\\u201312 months corrected age ( median 8 months ) , 59 ( 82 % ) had a least one TSFI score concerning for abnormal sensory reactivity . Lower gestational age was associated with abnormal reactivity to deep pressure and vestibular stimulation ( p<0.001 ) . Poor ocular-motor control predicted worse cognitive and motor scores in early childhood ( OR 16.7 ; p=0.004 ) , but was tightly correlated to the presence of severe white matter injury . Poor adaptive motor function in response to tactile stimuli predicted worse BSID III motor ( p=0.01 ) and language scores ( p=0.04 ) at 2 years , even after adjusting for confounders . Conclusions Abnormal sensory reactivity is common in preterm infants ; is associated with immaturity at birth , severe white matter injury and lower primary caregiver education ; and predicts neurodevelopmental delays . Early identification of abnormal sensory reactivity of very preterm infants may promote parental support and education and may facilitate improved neurodevelopment', \\\"OBJECTIVES To determine the mortality and morbidity for infants weighing 401 to 1500 g ( very low birth weight [ VLBW ] ) at birth by gestational age , birth weight , and gender . STUDY DESIGN Perinatal data were collected prospect ively on an inborn cohort from January 1995 through December 1996 by 14 participating centers of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Neonatal Research Network and were compared with the corresponding data from previous reports . Sociodemographic factors , perinatal events , and the neonatal course to 120 days of life , discharge , or death were evaluated . RESULTS Eighty four percent of 4438 infants weighing 501 to 1500 g at birth  survived until discharge to home or to a long-term care facility ( compared with 80 % in 1991 and 74 % in 1988 ) . Survival to discharge was 54 % for infants 501 to 750 g at birth , 86 % for those 751 to 1000 g , 94 % for those 1001 to 1250 g , and 97 % for those 1251 to 1500 g . The incidence of chronic lung disease ( CLD ; defined as receiving supplemental oxygen at 36 weeks ' postmenstrual age ; 23 % ) , proven necrotizing enterocolitis ( NEC ; 7 % ) , and severe intracranial hemorrhage ( ICH ; grade III or IV ; 11 % ) remained unchanged between 1991 and 1996 . Furthermore , 97 % of all VLBW infants and 99 % of infants weighing < 1000 g at birth had weights less than the 10th percentile at 36 weeks ' postmenstrual age . Mortality for 195 infants weighing 401 to 500 g was 89 % , with nearly all survivors developing CLD . Mortality in infants weighing 501 to 600 g was 71 % ; among survivors , 62 % had CLD , 35 % had severe ICH , and 15 % had proven NEC . CONCLUSIONS Survival for infants between 501 and 1500 g at birth continued to improve , particularly for infants weighing < 1000 g at birth . This improvement in survival was not associated with an increase in major morbidities , because the incidence of CLD , proven NEC , and severe ICH did not change . However , poor postnatal growth remains a major concern , occurring in 99 % of infants weighing < 1000 g at birth . Mortality and major morbidity ( CLD , severe ICH , and NEC ) remain high for the smallest infants , particularly those weighing < 600 g at birth\\\", \\\"Objective : To study whether new pharmacological and nonpharmacological guidelines lowered numbers of painful procedures  in neonates and changed the amount and frequency of analgesic therapy as compared to the results of our previous study in 2001 . Design : A prospect i ve observational study . Setting : Level III NICU of the Erasmus MC-Sophia Children 's Hospital , Rotterdam . Participants : Neonates admitted at postnatal ages less than 3 days with length of stay at least 72 h. Main Outcome Measures : Number of all potentially painful procedures and analgesic therapy  recorded at the bedside during the first 14 days of NICU stay . Results : A total number of 21,076 procedures were performed in the 175 neonates studied during 1,730 patient-days ( mean 12.2 ) . The mean number of painful procedures per neonate per day was 11.4 ( SD 5.7 ) , significantly lower than the number of 14.3 ( SD 4.0 ) in 2001 ( p < 0.001 ) . The use of analgesics  was 36.6 % compared to 60.3 % in 2001 . Sixty-three percent of all peripheral arterial line insertions failed versus 37.5 % in 2001 and 9.1 % venipunctures failed versus 21 % in 2001 . Conclusions : The mean number of painful procedures per NICU patient per day declined . Nonpharmacological pain- or stress-reducing strategies like NIDCAP and sucrose were fully embedded in our pain management . As further reduction of the number of painful procedures is unlikely , we should apply more nonpharmacological interventions and explore newer pharmacological agents\\\"]\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"predicted_abstract\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 250,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"There was no evidence to support the use of psychological interventions in the treatment of depression in people with type 2 diabetes.\\nThere were no significant differences between psychological and non-pharmacological interventions with respect to weight loss, body fatness, or blood glucose control, but there was evidence of a greater effect of psychosocial interventions on weight gain and body mass index than with no treatment.\",\n          \"There was no evidence to support the use of education or lumbar supports for the prevention of low back pain or sick leave in the workplace.\\nThere were no significant differences between educational and non-educational interventions with respect to absenteeism.\",\n          \"The results of this systematic review and meta- analysis suggest that preterm infants are at increased risk of experiencing impaired sensory processing in the neonatal period.\\nHowever, there is no evidence to support the use of pharmacological or nonpharmacological interventions to reduce the number of painful procedures in neonates.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"target\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 250,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"INTERPRETATION In type 2 diabetes , there are improvements in long-term glycaemic control and psychological distress but not in weight control or blood glucose concentration in people who receive psychological therapies\",\n          \"The trials suggest that work place exercise is effective , braces and education are ineffective , and workplace modification plus education is of unknown value in preventing low back pain\",\n          \"Results of this review support the presence of sensory modulation problems in preterm children .\\nSensory modulation problems may play a key role in underst and ing neurocognitive and behavioral sequelae in preterm children .\\nSome support is found for a dose-response relationship between both white matter brain injury and length of NICU stay and sensory modulation problems\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
