### ABSTRACT
Reviews of medical studies serve as very valuable tools for researchers but are expensive to produce
manually. With this project, we aimed to develop a model that creates automated summaries of
multiple medical studies. We fine-tuned multiple large language models and compared the results. We
found the best results were generated using the LongformerEncoderDecoder (LED) model.
