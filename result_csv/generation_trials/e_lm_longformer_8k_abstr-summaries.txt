------------------Generated Summary------------------------
There was no evidence of a significant effect of glucomannan on body weight loss, body fatness, body composition, or body weight change in overweight/obese subjects.
CONCLUSIONS There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of any particular type of fiber in the treatment of hyperglycemia in overweight or obese subjects.
------------------Original Summary------------------------
The use of glucomannan did not appear to significantly alter any other study endpoints .
Pediatric patients , patients receiving dietary modification , and patients with impaired glucose metabolism did not benefit from glucomannan to the same degree .
Glucomannan appears to beneficially affect total cholesterol , LDL cholesterol , triglycerides , body weight , and FBG , but not HDL cholesterol or BP

------------------Generated Summary------------------------
There was no evidence of a significant effect of glucomannan on body weight loss, body fatness, body composition, or body weight change in overweight/obese subjects.
CONCLUSIONS There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of any particular type of fiber in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus.
However, there is some evidence that the addition of soluble fiber to a CRD may have a small but significant effect on weight loss and body weight reduction.
There is no evidence to suggest that it is better to use soluble fiber as an adjunctive treatment for weight loss than to use it as an adjunct to a diet or exercise regimen alone.
The use of soluble fibre in combination with a diet, exercise regimen, or combination of a diet and a pharmacological treatment may be beneficial for weight reduction and /or body weight control.
It is not clear whether soluble fiber is more effective than a diet alone.

The results of this systematic review and meta- analysis suggest that the use of glucomannan as an adjunctive treatment for hyperglycemia in overweight/obese children may be effective in reducing blood glucose and lowering LDL-C and HDL-C.

------------------Generated Summary------------------------
The results of this systematic review and meta- analysis suggest that the use of glucomannan as an adjunctive treatment for hyperglycemia in overweight/obese children may be effective in reducing blood glucose and lowering LDL-C and HDL-C.
However, it is still premature to make any definitive statements on the effectiveness of this intervention in this population.
There is currently no evidence to support its use as an adjunct to diet or exercise in the treatment of hyperglycaemia in overweight or obese children.
The use of a combination of soluble fiber with a CRD seems to be more likely to result in weight loss than a single dose of soluble fibre alone.
In conclusion, there is insufficient evidence from r and omized controlled trials to support the routine use of soluble fibres in the long-term treatment of overweight and obesity in overweight and obese children and adolescents.
It is therefore not possible to make a definitive statement

However, there is currently no evidence to support its use as an adjunct to diet or exercise in the treatment of hyperglycaemia in children and adolescents.
There is no evidence that it is beneficial to use it as an add-on treatment to diet alone or as a supplement to exercise alone.
It is therefore not possible to make any definitive statements on whether or not it is better to use a combination of diet and exercise alone or in addition to diet to reduce blood glucose or triglycerides in children or adolescents or adults.
