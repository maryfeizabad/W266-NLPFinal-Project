            "The longest abstract is: ['Background Blunt head trauma is a common cause of death and disability in children worldwide . Cranial computed tomography ( CT ) , the reference st and ard for the diagnosis of traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) , exposes children to ionizing radiation which has been linked to the development of brain tumors , leukemia , and other cancers . We describe the methods used to develop and test the effectiveness of a decision aid to facilitate shared decision-making with parents regarding whether to obtain a head CT scan or to further observe their child at home . Methods / Design This is a protocol for a multicenter clinician-level parallel r and omized trial to compare an intervention group receiving a decision aid , ‘ Head CT Choice ’ , to a control group receiving usual care . The trial will be conducted at five diverse emergency departments ( EDs ) in Minnesota and California . Clinicians will be r and omized to decision aid or usual care . Parents visiting the ED with children who are less than 18-years-old , have experienced blunt head trauma within 24 hours , and have one or two risk factors for clinical ly-important TBI ( ciTBI ) from the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network head injury clinical prediction rules will be eligible for enrollment . We will measure the effect of Head CT Choice on : ( 1 ) parent knowledge regarding their child ’s risk of ciTBI , the available diagnostic options , and the risks of radiation exposure associated with a cranial CT scan ( primary outcome ) ; ( 2 ) parent engagement in the decision-making process ; ( 3 ) the degree of conflict parents experience related to feeling uninformed ; ( 4 ) patient and clinician satisfaction with the decision made ; ( 5 ) the rate of ciTBI at seven days ; ( 6 ) the proportion of patients in whom a cranial CT scan is obtained ; and ( 7 ) seven-day healthcare utilization . To capture these outcomes , we will administer parent and clinician surveys immediately after each clinical encounter , obtain video recordings of parent-clinician discussion s , administer parent healthcare utilization diaries , analyze hospital billing records , review the electronic medical record , and conduct telephone follow-up . Discussion This multicenter trial will robustly assess the effectiveness of a decision aid on patient-centered outcomes , safety , and healthcare utilization in parents of children with minor head trauma in five diverse EDs . Trial registration Clinical Trials.gov registration number : NCT02063087 . Registration date February 13 , 2014', 'R and omised controlled trials ( RCTs ) can be hampered by poor patient accrual and retention . Decision aids ( DAs ) containing simple , evidence -based information , may assist patients with decision-making regarding trial participation . The current DA was of use for 95 % of participants . Further evaluation of the DA in a RCT is currently underway', 'Objective To evaluate the effect of a video decision support tool on the preferences for future medical care in older people if they develop advanced dementia , and the stability of those preferences after six weeks . Design R and omised controlled trial conducted between 1 September 2007 and 30 May 2008 . Setting Four primary care clinics ( two geriatric and two adult medicine ) affiliated with three academic medical centres in Boston . Participants Convenience sample of 200 older people ( ≥65 years ) living in the community with previously scheduled appointments at one of the clinics . Mean age was 75 and 58 % were women . Intervention Verbal narrative alone ( n=106 ) or with a video decision support tool ( n=94 ) . Main outcome measures Preferred goal of care : life prolonging care ( cardiopulmonary resuscitation , mechanical ventilation ) , limited care ( admission to hospital , antibiotics , but not cardiopulmonary resuscitation ) , or comfort care ( treatment only to relieve symptoms ) . Preferences after six weeks . The principal category for analysis was the difference in proportions of participants in each group who preferred comfort care . Results Among participants receiving the verbal narrative alone , 68 ( 64 % ) chose comfort care , 20 ( 19 % ) chose limited care , 15 ( 14 % ) chose life prolonging care , and three ( 3 % ) were uncertain . In the video group , 81 ( 86 % ) chose comfort care , eight ( 9 % ) chose limited care , four ( 4 % ) chose life prolonging care , and one ( 1 % ) was uncertain ( χ2=13.0 , df=3 , P=0.003 ) . Among all participants the factors associated with a greater likelihood of opting for comfort care were being a college graduate or higher , good or better health status , greater health literacy , white race , and r and omisation to the video arm . In multivariable analysis , participants in the video group were more likely to prefer comfort care than those in the verbal group ( adjusted odds ratio 3.9 , 95 % confidence interval 1.8 to 8.6 ) . Participants were re-interviewed after six weeks . Among the 94/106 ( 89 % ) participants re-interviewed in the verbal group , 27 ( 29 % ) changed their preferences ( κ=0.35 ) . Among the 84/94 ( 89 % ) participants re-interviewed in the video group , five ( 6 % ) changed their preferences ( κ=0.79 ) ( P<0.001 for difference ) . Conclusion Older people who view a video depiction of a patient with advanced dementia after hearing a verbal description of the condition are more likely to opt for comfort as their goal of care compared with those who solely listen to a verbal description . They also have more stable preferences over time . Trial registration Clinical trials.gov NCT00704886', 'Summary Use of the Chronic Pain Management Program was associated with significant decreases in pain‐related , functional , and mental health outcomes and an increase in pain knowledge . Abstract Internet‐based educational and therapeutic programs ( e‐health applications ) are becoming increasingly popular for a variety of psychological and physical disorders . We tested the efficacy of an online Chronic Pain Management Program , a comprehensive , fully self‐directed and self‐paced system that integrates social networking features and self‐management tools into an interactive learning environment . Of 305 adult participants ( 196 women , 109 men ) , a total of 162 individuals with chronic pain were r and omly assigned unsupervised access to the program  for approximately 6 weeks ; 143 were assigned to the wait‐listed control group with treatment as usual .  A comprehensive assessment was administered before the study and approximately 7 and 14 weeks thereafter . All recruitment , data collection , and participant involvement took place online . Participation was fully self‐paced , permitting the evaluation of program effectiveness under real‐world conditions . Intent‐to‐treat analysis that used linear growth models was used as the primary analytic tool . Results indicated that program utilization was associated with significant decreases in pain severity , pain‐related interference and emotional burden , perceived disability , catastrophizing , and pain‐induced fear . Further , program use led to significant declines in depression , anxiety , and stress . Finally , as compared to the wait‐listed control group , the experimental group displayed a significant increase in knowledge about the principles of chronic pain and its management . Study limitations are considered , including the recognition that not all persons with chronic pain are necessarily good c and i date s for self‐initiated , self‐paced , interactive learning', 'Background — Cardiac stress testing in patients at low risk for acute coronary syndrome is associated with increased false-positive test results , unnecessary downstream procedures , and increased cost . We judged it unlikely that patient preferences were driving the decision to obtain stress testing . Methods and Results — The Chest Pain Choice trial was a prospect i ve r and omized evaluation involving 204 patients who were r and omized to a decision aid or usual care and were followed for 30 days . The decision aid included a 100-person pictograph depicting the pretest probability of acute coronary syndrome and available management options ( observation unit admission and stress testing or 24–72 hours outpatient follow-up ) . The primary outcome was patient knowledge measured by an immediate postvisit survey . Additional outcomes included patient engagement in decision making and the proportion of patients who decided to undergo observation unit admission and cardiac stress testing . Compared with usual care patients ( n=103 ) , decision aid patients ( n=101 ) had significantly greater knowledge ( 3.6 versus 3.0 questions correct ; mean difference , 0.67 ; 95 % CI , 0.34–1.0 ) , were more engaged in decision making as indicated by higher OPTION ( observing patient involvement ) scores ( 26.6 versus 7.0 ; mean difference , 19.6 ; 95 % CI , 1.6–21.6 ) , and decided less frequently to be admitted to the observation unit for stress testing ( 58 % versus 77 % ; absolute difference , 19 % ; 95 % CI , 6%–31 % ) . There were no major adverse cardiac events after discharge in either group . Conclusions — Use of a  decision aid  in patients with chest pain increased knowledge and engagement in decision making and decreased the rate of observation unit admission for stress testing .

Unique identifier : NCT01077037', 'Decision aids in North American breast cancer out patients have been shown to assist with treatment decision making and reduce decisional conflict . To date , appropriate delivery formats to effectively increase patient participation in newly diagnosed breast cancer in patients have not been investigated in the context of German health care provision . The impact of a decision aid intervention was studied in patients ( n=111 ) with a strong suspicion of breast cancer in a r and omised controlled trial . The primary outcome variable was decisional conflict . Participants were followed up 1 week post-intervention with a retention rate of 92 % . Analyses revealed that the intervention group felt better informed ( ηp2=0.06 ) but did not experience an overall reduction in decisional conflict as compared with the control group . The intervention had no effect on uptake rates of treatment options , length of consultation with the surgeon , time point of treatment decision making , perceived involvement in decision making , neither decision related nor general patient satisfaction . Patients who received the decision aid intervention experienced a small benefit with regards to how informed they felt about advantages and disadvantages of relevant treatment options . Results are discussed in terms of context ual factors and individual differences as moderators of treatment decision aid effectiveness', 'Purpose . Women with localized breast cancer face difficult decisions about adjuvant therapy . Several decision aids are available to help women choose between treatment options . Decision aids are known to affect treatment choices and may therefore affect patient survival . The authors aim ed to model the effects of the Adjuvant ! decision aid on expected survival in women with early stage breast cancer . Patients and Methods . Data were obtained from a r and omized trial of Adjuvant ! ( n = 395 ) . To calculate the effects of the decision aid on survival , the authors used the Adjuvant ! survival predictions as a surrogate endpoint . Data from each arm were entered separately into statistical models to estimate change in survival associated with receiving the Adjuvant ! decision aid . Results . Most women ( ∼ 85 % ) chose a treatment option that maximized predicted survival . The effects of the decision aid on outcome could not be modeled because a small number of women ( n = 12 , 3 % ) chose treatment options associated with a large ( 5%—14 % ) loss in survival . These women — most typically estrogen receptor positive but refusing hormonal therapy — were equally divided between Adjuvant ! and control groups and were not distinguished by medical or demographic factors . Conclusions . Expected benefit from treatment is a key variable in underst and ing patient behavior . A small number of women refuse adjuvant treatment associated with large increases in predicted survival , even when they are explicitly informed about the degree of benefit they would forgo . Investigation of the effects of decision aids on cancer survival is unlikely to be fruitful due to power considerations', \"OBJECTIVE Although African American ( AA ) men are at elevated risk for prostate cancer , medical guidelines do not present consistent screening recommendations for this group . However , all guidelines stress the need for screening decision making with a provider . This study evaluated the effectiveness of a brochure for the female partners of AA men , design ed to help promote such discussion on the part of their mates . We also explored the effect of the partner 's monitoring style ( i.e. , the extent to which the partner typically attends to health threats ) on promoting discussion . METHODS Female partners of AA men ( N = 231 ) were r and omized to receive either a  prostate cancer screening Centers for Disease Control brochure for AA men , combined with a ' partner ' brochure containing strategies to promote men 's initiation of a provider visit to discuss screening , or the Centers for Disease Control brochure only and completed preintervention and post-intervention surveys online . RESULTS The message groups did not differ on taking active steps to engage in provider discussion : relative risk ratio ( RRR ) = 0.99 , p = .98 ; thinking about it : RRR = 1.13 , p = .74 . However , among partners who received the partner brochure , monitoring style was associated with ' thinking about initiating a provider visit ' on the part of the mate ( RRR = 1.74 , p < .01 ) . Across conditions , monitoring style was also associated with ' taking active steps to initiate a provider visit ' on the part of the mate ( RRR = 1.38 , p < .05 ) . CONCLUSIONS High monitoring partners may be effective in influencing their AA mates to initiate provider discussion , particularly when tailored messaging is provided\", 'Background Professional societies recommend shared decision making ( SDM ) for prostate cancer screening , however , most efforts have promoted informed rather than shared decision making . The objective of this study is to 1 ) examine the effects of a prostate cancer screening intervention to promote SDM and 2 ) determine whether framing prostate information in the context of other clearly beneficial men ’s health services affects decisions . Methods We conducted two separate r and omized controlled trials of the same prostate cancer intervention ( with or without additional information on more clearly beneficial men ’s health services ) . For each trial , we enrolled a convenience sample of 2 internal medicine practice s , and their interested physicians and male patients with no prior history of prostate cancer ( for a total of 4 practice s , 28 physicians , and 128 men across trials ) . Within each practice site , we r and omized men to either 1 ) a video-based decision aid and research er-led coaching session or 2 ) a highway safety video . Physicians at each site received a 1-hour educational session on prostate cancer and SDM . To assess intervention effects , we measured key components of SDM , intent to be screened , and actual screening . After finding that results did not vary by trial , we combined data across sites , adjusting for the r and om effects of both practice and physician . Results Compared to an attention control , our prostate cancer screening intervention increased men ’s perceptions that screening is a decision ( absolute difference + 41 % ; 95 % CI 25 to 57 % ) and men ’s knowledge about prostate cancer screening ( absolute difference + 34 % ; 95 % CI 19 % to 50 % ) , but had no effect on men ’s self-reported participation in shared decisions or their participation at their preferred level . Overall , the intervention decreased screening intent ( absolute difference −34 % ; 95 % CI −50 % to −18 % ) and actual screening rates ( absolute difference −22 % ; 95 % CI −38 to −7 % ) with no difference in effect by frame . Conclusions SDM interventions can increase men ’s knowledge , alter their perceptions of prostate cancer screening , and reduce actual screening . However , they may not guarantee an increase in shared decisions . Trial registration #', \"ABSTRACT Despite increased interest among the public in breast cancer genetic risk and genetic testing , there are limited services to help women make informed decisions about genetic testing . This study , conducted with female callers ( N = 279 ) to the National Cancer Institute 's ( NCI 's ) Atlantic Region Cancer Information Service ( CIS ) , developed and evaluated a theory-based , educational intervention design ed to increase callers ' underst and ing of the following : ( a ) the kinds of information required to determine inherited risk ; ( b ) their own personal family history of cancer ; and ( c ) the benefits and limitations of genetic testing . Callers requesting information about breast/ovarian cancer risk , risk assessment services , and genetic testing were r and omized to either : ( 1 ) st and ard care or ( 2 ) an educational intervention . Results show that the educational intervention reduced intention to obtain genetic testing among women at average risk and increased intention among high-risk women at 6 months . In addition , high monitors , who typically attend to and seek information , demonstrated greater increases in knowledge and perceived risk over the 6-month interval than low monitors , who typically are distracted from information . These findings suggest that theoretically design ed interventions can be effective in helping women underst and their cancer risk and appropriate risk assessment options and can be implemented successfully within a service program like the CIS\", \"Background In the UK public concern about the safety of the combined measles , mumps and rubella [ MMR ] vaccine continues to impact on MMR coverage . Whilst the sharp decline in uptake has begun to level out , first and second dose uptake rates remain short of that required for population immunity . Furthermore , international research consistently shows that some parents lack confidence in making a decision about MMR vaccination for their children . Together , this work suggests that effective interventions are required to support parents to make informed decisions about MMR.This trial assessed the impact of a parent-centred , multi-component intervention ( balanced information , group discussion , coaching exercise ) on informed parental decision-making for MMR . Methods This was a two arm , cluster r and omised trial . One hundred and forty two UK parents of children eligible for MMR vaccination were recruited from six primary healthcare centres and six childcare organisations . The intervention arm received an MMR information leaflet and participated in the intervention ( parent meeting ) . The control arm received the leaflet only . The primary outcome was decisional conflict . Secondary outcomes were actual and intended MMR choice , knowledge , attitude , concern and necessity beliefs about MMR and anxiety . Results Decisional conflict decreased for both arms to a level where an ' effective ' MMR decision could be made one-week ( effect estimate = -0.54 , p < 0.001 ) and three-months ( effect estimate = -0.60 , p < 0.001 ) post-intervention . There was no significant difference between arms ( effect estimate = 0.07 , p = 0.215 ) . Heightened decisional conflict was evident for parents making the MMR decision for their first child ( effect estimate = -0.25 , p = 0.003 ) , who were concerned ( effect estimate = 0.07 , p < 0.001 ) , had less positive attitudes ( effect estimate = -0.20 , p < 0.001 ) yet stronger intentions ( effect estimate = 0.09 , p = 0.006 ) . Significantly more parents in the intervention arm reported vaccinating their child ( 93 % versus 73 % , p = 0.04 ) . Conclusions Whilst both the leaflet and the parent meeting reduced parents ' decisional conflict , the parent meeting appeared to enable parents to act upon their decision leading to vaccination uptake\", \"BACKGROUND Compared with in-center hemodialysis , self-care dialysis ( including home and self-care hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis ) is less re source intensive and associated with similar clinical outcomes . However , utilization of self-care dialysis has been very low . We performed a r and omized controlled trial in predialysis patients with chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) ( GFR < 30 mL/min ) to determine the impact of a patient-centered educational intervention on patients ' intention to initiate dialysis with self-care dialysis . METHODS Seventy patients with CKD who were receiving care in a multidisciplinary predialysis clinic were r and omized to receive either ( 1 ) a two-phase patient-centered educational intervention ( phase 1 included educational booklets and a 15-minute video on self-care dialysis ; phase 2 included a 90-minute small group interactive educational session on self-care dialysis ) in addition to their regular multidisciplinary care , or ( 2 ) ongoing st and ard care and education in the multidisciplinary predialysis clinic . The primary outcome was patients ' intention to initiate dialysis with self-care dialysis , assessed by question naire . RESULTS Thirty-five patients were r and omized to st and ard care ; 34 completed the study . Thirty-five patients were r and omized to the educational intervention ; 30 completed phase 1 and 28 completed phase 2 . By study end , significantly more patients in the intervention group ( 82.1 % ) intended to start dialysis with self-care dialysis  compared with the st and ard care group ( 50 % , P= 0.015 ) . This difference persisted after controlling for the small baseline differences among patients in the two study groups ( P= 0.004 ) . CONCLUSION A two-phase educational intervention can increase the proportion of patients who intend to initiate dialysis with self-care dialysis\", 'Background Patient-centered diabetes care requires shared decision making ( SDM ) . Decision aids promote SDM , but their efficacy in nonacademic and rural primary care clinics is unclear . Methods We cluster-r and omized 10 practice s in a concealed fashion to implement either a decision aid ( DA ) about starting statins or one about choosing antihyperglycemic agents . Each practice served as a control group for another practice implementing the other type of DA .  From April 2011 to July 2012 , 103 ( DA=53 ) patients with type 2 diabetes participated in the trial . We used patient and clinician surveys administered after the clinical encounter to collect decisional outcomes ( patient knowledge and comfort with decision making , patient and clinician satisfaction ) . Medical records provided data on metabolic control . Pharmacy fill profiles provided data for estimating adherence to therapy . Results Compared to usual care , patients receiving the DA were more likely to report discussing medications ( 77 % vs. 45 % , p<.001 ) , were more likely to answer knowledge questions correctly ( risk reduction with statins 61 % vs. 33 % , p=.07 ; knowledge about options 57 % vs. 33 % , p=.002 ) and were more engaged by their clinicians in decision making ( 50 . vs. 28 , difference 21.4 ( 95 % CI 6.4 , 36.3 ) , p=.01 ) . We found no significant impact on patient satisfaction , medication starts , adherence or clinical outcomes , in part due to limited statistical power . Conclusion DAs improved decisional outcomes without significant effect on clinical outcomes . DAs design ed for point-of-care use with type 2 diabetes patients promoted shared decision making in nonacademic and rural primary care practice s . Trial Registration', 'Purpose .

The two primary outcome measures were patient decision process and the decision outcome . Patient decision process was assessed using the decisional conflict scale . Decision outcome was defined as the proportion of colorectal cancer screening plans carried out . Results . After controlling for the effects of the physicians in a factorial analysis of variance , patients who used the decision aid had lower decisional conflict regarding colorectal cancer screening decisions ( F ratio6.47 , P = 0.01 ) due to increased knowledge , better clarity of values , and higher ratings of the quality of the decisions they made . There was no difference between the groups in decision outcomes : 52 % of patients in the control group and 49 % in the experimental group completed planned screening tests ( P = 1.0 ) . Conclusions . In a pilot study , a multi criteria -based patient decision aid for colorectal cancer screening improved patients ’ decision-making processes but had no effect on the implementation of screening plans', 'Background Patients , identified to be at risk for but who have never experienced a potentially lethal cardiac arrhythmia , have the option of receiving an implantable cardioverter defibrillator ( ICD ) as prophylaxis against sudden cardiac death - a primary prevention indication . In Canada , there is no clear framework to support patients ’ decision-making for these devices . Decision support , using a decision aid , could moderate treatment-related uncertainty and prepare patients to make well-informed decisions . Patient decision aids provide information on treatment options , risks , and benefits , to help patients clarify their values for outcomes of treatment options . The objectives of this research are : 1 ) develop a decision aid , 2 ) evaluate the decision aid , and 3 ) determine the feasibility of conducting a trial . Methods / design A development panel comprised of the core investigative team , health service research ers , decision science experts , cardiovascular healthcare practitioners , and ICD patient representatives will collaborate to provide input on the content and format of the aid . To generate probabilities to include in the aid , we will synthesize primary prevention ICD evidence . To obtain anonymous input about the facts and content , we will employ a modified Delphi process . To evaluate the draft decision aid will invite ICD patients and their families ( n = 30 ) to rate its acceptability . After we evaluate the aid , to determine the feasibility , we will conduct a feasibility pilot r and omized controlled trial ( RCT ) in new ICD c and i date s ( n = 80 ) . Participants will be r and omized to receive a decision aid  prior to specialist consultation versus usual care .  Results from the pilot RCT will determine the feasibility of research processes ; inform sample size calculation , measure decision quality ( knowledge , values , decision conflict ) and the influence of health related quality of life on decision-making . Discussion Our study seeks to develop a decision aid , for patients offered their first ICD for prophylaxis against sudden cardiac death . This paper outlines the background and methods of a pilot r and omized trial which will inform a larger multicenter trial . Ultimately , decision support prior to specialist consultation could enhance the decision-making process between patients , physicians , and families , associated with life-prolonging medical devices like the ICD.Trial registration Clinical Trials.gov :', 'Background : Cancer patients experience many physical and psychosocial problems for which they need support . WebChoice is an Internet-based , interactive health communication application that allows cancer patients to monitor their symptoms and problems , provides individually tailored information and self-management support , e-communication with expert cancer nurses , and an e-forum for group discussion with other patients . Objective : The objective of this study was to examine the effects of WebChoice on symptom distress ( primary outcome ) , depression , self-efficacy , health-related quality of life , and social support ( secondary outcomes ) . Methods : In this 1-year repeated- measures r and omized controlled trial , 325 breast and prostate cancer patients were r and omized into 1 experimental group  with access to WebChoice and 1 control group who received URLs of publicly available cancer Web sites . Results : Group differences on symptom distress were significant only for the global symptom distress index on the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale ( slope estimate , −0.052 [ 95 % confidence interval , −0.101 to −0.004 ] ; t = 4.42 ; P = .037 ) . There were no significant group differences on secondary outcomes . Additional analyses showed significant within-group improvements in depression in the experimental group only . In the control group , self-efficacy and health-related quality of life deteriorated significantly over time . Conclusion : This r and omized controlled trial is one of the first to evaluate effects of an interactive health communication application to support cancer patients in illness management on symptoms . Although only 1 hypothesis was partially supported , the combined results show a clear trend toward better scores in the intervention group on most outcome measures . Implication s for Practice : If findings can be supported with additional research , WebChoice may become an important tool to support nursing care that can equip cancer patients to better manage their illness', 'Background Lack of patient involvement in decision making has been suggested as one reason for limited treatment success . Concepts such as shared decision making may contribute to high quality healthcare by supporting patients to make informed decisions together with their physicians . A multi-component shared decision making programme on the prevention of heart attack in type 2 diabetes has been developed . It aims at improving the quality of decision-making by providing evidence -based patient information , enhancing patients ’ knowledge , and supporting them to actively participate in decision-making . In this study the efficacy of the programme is evaluated in the setting of a diabetes clinic . Methods / Design A single blinded r and omised-controlled trial is conducted to compare the shared decision making programme with a control-intervention . The intervention consists of an evidence -based patient decision aid on the prevention of myocardial infa rct ion and a corresponding counselling module provided by diabetes educators . Similar in duration and structure , the control-intervention targets nutrition , sports , and stress coping .  A total of 154 patients between 40 and 69 years of age with type 2 diabetes and no previous diagnosis of ischaemic heart disease or stroke are enrolled and allocated either to the intervention or the control-intervention . Primary outcome measure is the patients ’ knowledge on benefits and harms of heart attack prevention captured by a st and ardised knowledge test . Key secondary outcome measure is the achievement of treatment goals prioritised by the individual patient . Treatment goals refer to statin taking , HbA1c- , blood pressure levels and smoking status . Outcomes are assessed directly after the counselling and at 6 months follow-up . Analyses will be carried out on intention-to-treat basis . Concurrent qualitative methods are used to explore intervention fidelity and to gain insight into implementation processes . Discussion Interventions to facilitate evidence -based shared decision making represent an innovative approach in diabetes care . The results of this study will provide information on the efficacy of such a concept in the setting of a diabetes clinic in Germany . Trial registration IS RCT', \"There is an ever-growing trend toward more patient involvement in making health care decisions . This trend has been accompanied by the development of “ informed decision-making ” interventions to help patients become more engaged and comfortable with making these decisions . We describe the effects of a prostate cancer screening decision aid on knowledge , beliefs about screening , risk perception , control preferences , decisional conflict , and decisional anxiety . Data were collected from 200 males aged 50–70 years in the general population who r and omly were assigned to exposure to the decision aid or no exposure as a control condition .  A Solomon four-group design was used to test for possible pretest sensitization effects and to assess the effects of exposure to the decision aid . No significant pretest sensitization effects were found . Analysis of the exposure effects found that knowledge increased significantly for those exposed to the decision aid compared with those unexposed . Exposure to the decision aid also had some influence on decreasing both decisional conflict and decisional anxiety . Decision aids can play an important role in increasing patients ' knowledge and decreasing anxiety when asked to make health care decisions\", 'Background Diagnostic self-tests are becoming increasingly available . Since the pros and cons of self-testing are unclear and neutral information on self-testing is lacking , two decision aids ( DAs ) on self-testing for cholesterol and diabetes were developed to support consumers in making an informed choice that is in line with their personal values . We aim ed to evaluate the effect of the DAs on the intention to self-test for cholesterol or diabetes , as well as socio-cognitive determinants of that intention . Methods 1137 people of an internet panel with an intention to use a diagnostic self-test for cholesterol or diabetes were enrolled in a web-based r and omized controlled trial consisting of four groups : a cholesterol intervention and control group and a diabetes intervention and control group . The study was conducted in September and October 2011 . The intervention groups received an interactive online DA with general information on self-testing and test-specific information on cholesterol or diabetes self-testing , whereas the control groups received a limited information sheet with general information on self-testing . The intention to use a self-test for cholesterol or diabetes and perceived susceptibility , perceived severity , cues to action , perceived benefits , perceived barriers , self-efficacy and ambivalence towards self-testing were assessed directly after being exposed to the intervention or control information . Results Follow-up measurement was completed by 922 people . Analyses showed a significant group by intention at baseline interaction effect within the diabetes condition . Further exploration of this interaction showed that a main group-effect was only observed among maybe-intenders ; intention of participants in the intervention group did not change between baseline and follow-up , while intention slightly increased in the control group . We observed a significant main effect of group on cues to action in the cholesterol condition . Conclusions We found limited effects of the DAs on intention and its determinants . Although the time spent on the DAs was limited , we might assume that our DAs contain neutral information on self-testing for cholesterol and diabetes . By implementing our DAs in real life among people who probably or definitely intend to use a self-test and by assessing weblog files , we might be able to determine the effectiveness of our DAs on self-test behaviour . Dutch trial registerNTR3149', 'Background Men considering the prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) test for prostate cancer , an increasingly common male cancer , are encouraged to make informed decisions , as the test is limited in its accuracy and the natural history of the condition is poorly understood . The Web-based PSA decision aid , Prosdex , was developed as part of the UK Prostate Cancer Risk Management Programme in order to help men make such informed decisions . Objectives The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the Web-based PSA decision aid , Prosdex , on informed decision making . Methods A Web-based r and omized controlled trial was conducted in South Wales , United Kingdom . Men aged 50 to 75 who had not previously had a PSA test were r and omly allocated to two intervention and two control groups . Participants in the intervention groups either viewed Prosdex or were given a paper version of the text . The main outcome measures were the three components of informed decision making : ( 1 ) knowledge of prostate cancer and PSA , ( 2 ) attitude toward PSA testing , ( 3 ) behavior using a proxy measure , intention to undergo PSA testing . Decisional conflict and anxiety were also measured as was uptake of the PSA test . Outcomes were measured by means of an online question naire for the Prosdex group , the paper version group , and one of two control groups . Six months later , PSA test uptake was ascertained from general practitioners ’ records , and the online question naire was repeated . Results are reported in terms of the Mann-Whitney U-statistic divided by the product of the two sample sizes ( U/mm ) , line of no effect 0.50 . Results Participants were 514 men . Compared with the control group that completed the initial online question naire , men in the Prosdex group had increased knowledge about the PSA test and prostate cancer ( U/mn 0.70 ; 95 % CI 0.62 - 0.76 ) ; less favourable attitudes to PSA testing ( U/mn 0.39 , 95 % CI 0.31 - 0.47 ) ; were less likely to undergo PSA testing ( U/mn 0.40 , 95 % CI 0.32 - 0.48 ) ; and had less decisional conflict ( U/mn 0.32 , 95 % CI 0.25 - 0.40 ) ; while anxiety level did not differ ( U/mn 0.50 , 95 % CI 0.42 - 0.58 ) . For these outcomes there were no significant differences between men in the Prosdex group and the paper version group . However , in the Prosdex group , increased knowledge was associated with a less favourable attitude toward testing ( Spearman rank correlation [ ρ ] = -0.49 , P < .001 ) and lower intention to undergo testing ( ρ = -0.27 , P = .02 ) . After six months , PSA test uptake was lower in the Prosdex group than in the paper version and the question naire control group ( P = .014 ) . Test uptake was also lower in the control group that did not complete a question naire than in the control group that did , suggesting a possible Hawthorne effect of the question naire in favour of PSA testing . Conclusions Exposure to Prosdex was associated with improved knowledge about the PSA test and prostate cancer . Men who had a high level of knowledge had a less favourable attitude toward and were less likely to undergo PSA testing  . Prosdex appears to promote informed decision making regarding the PSA test .

Objective To explore the effectiveness of presenting health information on prostate cancer screening using video , internet , and written interventions on patient decision making , attitudes , knowledge , and screening interest . Design R and omized controlled trial . Participants A total of 161 men aged over 45 , who had never been screened for prostate cancer , were r and omized to receive information on prostate cancer screening . Measurements Participants were assessed at baseline and 1-week postintervention for decisional conflict , screening interest , knowledge , anxiety , and decision-making preference . Results A total of 156 men were followed-up at 1-week postintervention . There was no statistical , or clinical , difference in mean change in decisional conflict scores between the 3 intervention groups ( video vs internet −0.06 [ 95 % CI −0.24 to 0.12 ] ; video vs pamphlet 0.04 [ 95%CI −0.15 to 0.22 ] ; internet vs pamphlet 0.10 [ 95%CI −0.09 to 0.28 ] ) . There was also no statistically significant difference in mean knowledge , anxiety , decision-making preference , and screening interest between the 3 intervention groups . Conclusion Results from this study indicate that there are no clinical ly significant differences in decisional conflict when men are presented health information on prostate cancer screening via video , written material s , or the internet . Given the equivalence of the 3 methods , other factors need to be considered in deciding which method to use . Health professionals should provide patient health education material s via a method that is most convenient to the patient and their preferred learning style', \"Background Despite concerns that facilitating informed choice would decrease diabetes screening uptake , ' informed choice ' invitations that increased knowledge did not affect attendance ( the DICISION trial ) . We explored possible reasons using data from an experimental analogue study undertaken to develop the invitations . We tested a model of the impact on knowledge , attitude and intentions of a diabetes screening invitation design ed to facilitate informed choices . Methods 417 men and women aged 40 - 69 recruited from town centres in the UK were r and omised to receive either an invitation for diabetes screening design ed to facilitate informed choice or a st and ard type of invitation .  Knowledge of the invitation , attitude towards diabetes screening , and intention to attend for diabetes screening were assessed two weeks later . Results Attitude was a strong predictor of screening intentions ( β = .64 , p = .001 ) . Knowledge added to the model but was a weak predictor of intentions ( β = .13 , p = .005 ) . However , invitation type did not predict attitudes towards screening but did predict knowledge ( β = -.45 , p = .001 ) , which mediated a small effect of invitation type on intention ( indirect β = -.06 , p = .017 ) . Conclusions These findings may explain why information about the benefits and harms of screening did not reduce diabetes screening attendance in the DICISION trial\", \"BACKGROUND Patients nearing the end of their lives face an array of difficult decisions . OBJECTIVE This study was design ed to assess the feasibility and acceptability of a decision aid ( DA ) design ed for patients facing advanced or terminal illness . DESIGN We conducted a pilot r and omized clinical trial of Health Dialog 's Looking Ahead : choices for medical care when you 're seriously ill DA ( booklet and DVD ) applied to patients on a hospital-based palliative care ( PC ) service . SETTING University of Colorado Hospital - December 2009 and May 2010 . PARTICIPANTS All adult , English-speaking patients or their decision makers were potentially eligible . Patients were not approached if they were in isolation , did not speak English or if any provider felt that they were not appropriate because of issues such as family conflict or actively dying . INTERVENTION All participants received a st and ard PC consultation . Participants in the intervention arm also received a copy of the DA . Measurements Primary outcomes included decision conflict and knowledge . Participants in the intervention arm also completed an acceptability question naire and qualitative exit interviews . RESULTS Of the 239 patients or decision makers , 51(21 % ) enrolled in the trial . The DA had no significant effect on decision conflict or knowledge . Exit interviews indicated it was acceptable and empowering , although they wished they had access to the DA earlier . CONCLUSIONS While the DA was acceptable , feasibility was limited by late-life illness challenges . Future trials of this DA should be performed on patients earlier in their illness trajectory and should include additional outcome measures such as self-efficacy and confidence\", \"Increasing the number of bone marrow ( BM ) donors is important to ensure sufficient diversity on BM registries to meet the needs of patients . This study used an experimental approach to test the hypothesis that providing information about the risks of BM donation to allay unsubstantiated fears would reduce male and female participants ' perceptions of risk for donation and joining the Australian Bone Marrow Donor Registry ( ABMDR ) . Males ' and females ' intentions to register on the ABMDR and their attitudes , norms and perceived behavioural control ( efficacy ) in relation to registering were also explored . Participants were allocated r and omly to either a risk ( exposed to risk information about BM donation ) or no-risk ( not exposed to risk information ) condition . In partial support of hypotheses , exposure to risk information did reduce perceived risk for registering on the ABMDR for males only . Participants in the risk condition also demonstrated lower scores on attitude ( males only ) and intention compared with participants in the no-risk condition . These findings highlight the complex role of risk perceptions and gender differences in underst and ing people 's decisions to join a BM registry\", 'Objective To establish whether an interactive booklet on  respiratory tract infections in children reduces reconsultation for the same illness episode , reduces antibiotic use , and affects future consulting intentions , while maintaining parental satisfaction with care . Design Pragmatic cluster r and omised controlled trial . Setting 61 general practice s in Wales and Engl and . Participants 558 children ( 6 months to 14 years ) presenting to primary care with an acute respiratory tract infection ( 7 days or less ) . Children with suspected pneumonia , asthma or a serious concomitant illness , or needing immediate hospital admission were excluded . Three withdrew and 27 were lost to follow-up , leaving 528 ( 94.6 % ) with main outcome data . Interventions Clinicians in the intervention group were trained in the use of an interactive booklet on respiratory tract infections and asked to use the booklet during consultations with recruited patients ( and provide it as a take home re source ) . Clinicians in the control group conducted their consultations as usual . Main outcome measures The proportion of children who attended a face-to-face consultation about the same illness during the two week follow-up period . Secondary outcomes included antibiotic prescribing , antibiotic consumption , future consulting intentions , and parental satisfaction , reassurance , and enablement . Results Reconsultation occurred in 12.9 % of children in the intervention group and 16.2 % in the control group ( absolute risk reduction 3.3 % , 95 % confidence interval −2.7 % to 9.3 % , P=0.29 ) . Using multilevel modelling ( at the practice and individual level ) to account for clustering , no significant difference in reconsulting was noted ( odds ratio 0.75 ; 0.41 to 1.38 ) . Antibiotics were prescribed at the index consultation to 19.5 % of children in the intervention group and 40.8 % of children in the control group ( absolute risk reduction 21.3 % , 95 % confidence interval 13.7 to 28.9 ) , P<0.001 ) . A significant difference was still present after adjusting for clustering ( odds ratio 0.29 ; 0.14 to 0.60 ) . There was also a significant difference in the proportion of parents who said they would consult in the future if their child developed a similar illness ( odds ratio 0.34 ; 0.20 to 0.57 ) . Satisfaction , reassurance , and parental enablement scores were not significantly different between the two groups . Conclusions Use of a booklet on respiratory tract infections in children within primary care consultations led to important reductions in antibiotic prescribing and reduced intention to consult without reducing satisfaction with care . Trial registration Current Controlled Trials IS RCT', 'Study objectives : To assess whether providing women with additional information on the pros and cons of screening , compared with information currently offered by the NHS , affects their intention to attend for screening . Design : R and omised controlled trial . Participants were r and omly assigned to receive either the control , ( based on an NHS Cervical Screening Programme leaflet currently used ) , or the intervention leaflet ( containing additional information on risks and uncertainties ) . Setting : Three general practice s in Birmingham . Participants : 300 women aged 20 to 64 attending the practice s during a one month period . Main outcome measures : Intention to attend for screening . Main results : 283 women ( 94.3 % ) completed the study . Fewer women in the intervention ( 79 % ) than the control group ( 88 % ) expressed intention to have screening after reading the information leaflet ( difference between groups 9.2 % , 95 % confidence intervals ( CI ) 3.2 % to 21.7 % ) . The crude odds ratio ( OR ) and 95 % CI was 0.50 ( 0.26 to 0.97 ) . After adjusting for other factors , the trend persisted ( OR 0.60 , 95 % CI 0.28 to 1.29 ) . Having a previous Pap smear was the only significant predictor of intention to have screening ( adjusted OR 2.54 , 95 % CI 1.03 to 6.21 ) . Subgroup analysis showed no intervention effect in intended uptake between women at higher and lower risk of cervical cancer ( p=0.59 ) . Conclusions : Providing women with evidence based information on the risks , uncertainties , and the benefits of screening , is likely to deter some , but not differentially those at higher risk', 'The paper describes the design of computerized decision aid ( DA ) and a protocol for a cluster r and omized controlled trial to study the effects of computerized DA on decisional conflict and knowledge of pregnant Iranian women pertaining to the mode of delivery : Caesarean section vs. vaginal delivery', 'Background Individuals with a sibling who has had colorectal cancer diagnosed before age 61 are at increased risk for colorectal cancer and may derive particular benefit from screening . Tailored interventions may increase participation in appropriate colorectal cancer screening . Purpose This study evaluated the efficacy of two tailored interventions and a generic print intervention . Methods Participant siblings ( N = 412 ) who were not up-to- date with colorectal cancer screening were r and omly assigned to receive either a generic print pamphlet , a tailored print pamphlet , or a tailored print pamphlet and tailored counseling call .  Colorectal cancer screening 6 months after the baseline interview was the outcome measure . Results Results indicated that colorectal cancer screening adherence increased among intermediate risk siblings enrolled in all three intervention groups . Participants in both tailored intervention groups reported having colorectal cancer screening at significantly higher rates than participants in the generic print group . The increase in colorectal cancer screening in the tailored print and counseling call group was not significantly higher than that achieved by the tailored print alone . Decisional balance partially mediated treatment effects . Tailored behavioral interventions are effective methods for increasing screening adherence but telephone counseling did not add significantly to treatment effects', \"BACKGROUND It is important that patients are well-informed about risks and benefits of therapies to help them decide whether to accept medical therapy . Different numerical formats can be used in risk communication but It remains unclear how the different formats affect decisions made by real-life patients . AIM To compare the impact of using Prolongation Of Life ( POL ) and Absolute Risk Reduction ( ARR ) information formats to express effectiveness of cholesterol-lowering therapy on patients ' redemptions of statin prescriptions , and on patients ' confidence in their decision and satisfaction with the risk communication . DESIGN AND SETTING Cluster-r and omised clinical trial in general practice s. Thirty-four Danish GPs from 23 practice s participated in a primary care-based clinical trial concerning use of quantitative effectiveness formats for risk communication in health prevention consultations . METHOD GPs were cluster-r and omised ( treating practice s as clusters ) to inform patients about cardiovascular mortality risk and the effectiveness of statin treatment using either POL or ARR formats . Patients ' redemptions of statin prescriptions were obtained from a regional prescription data base . The COMRADE question naire was used to measure patients ' confidence in their decision and satisfaction with the risk communication . RESULTS Of the 240 patients included for analyses , 112 were allocated to POL information and 128 to ARR . Patients redeeming a statin prescription totalled six ( 5.4 % ) when informed using POL , and 32 ( 25.0 % ) when using ARR . The level of confidence in decision and satisfaction with risk communication did not differ between the risk formats . CONCLUSION Patients redeemed statin prescriptions less often when their GP communicated treatment effectiveness using POL compared with ARR\", 'Background Studies have shown that lifestyle  behavior changes are most effective to prevent onset of diabetes in high-risk patients . Primary care providers are charged with encouraging behavior change among their patients at risk for diabetes , yet the practice environment and training in primary care often do not support effective provider counseling . The goal of this study is to develop an electronic health record-embedded tool to facilitate shared patient-provider goal setting to promote behavioral change and prevent diabetes . Methods The ADAPT ( Avoiding Diabetes Thru Action Plan Targeting ) trial leverages an innovative system that integrates evidence -based interventions for behavioral change with already-existing technology to enhance primary care providers \\' effectiveness to counsel about lifestyle behavior changes . Using principles of behavior change theory , the multidisciplinary design team utilized in-depth interviews and in vivo usability testing to produce a prototype diabetes prevention counseling system embedded in the electronic health record . Results The core element of the tool is a streamlined , shared goal - setting module within the electronic health record system . The team then conducted a series of innovative , \" near-live \" usability testing simulations to refine the tool and enhance workflow integration . The system also incorporates a pre-encounter survey to elicit patients \\' behavior-change goals to help tailor patient-provider goal setting during the clinical encounter and to encourage shared decision making . Lastly , the patients interact with a website that collects their longitudinal behavior data and allows them to visualize their progress over time and compare their progress with other study members . The finalized ADAPT system is now being piloted in a small r and omized control trial of providers using the system with prediabetes patients over a six-month period . Conclusions The ADAPT system combines the influential powers of shared goal setting and feedback , tailoring , modeling , contracting , reminders , and social comparisons to integrate evidence -based behavior-change principles into the electronic health record to maximize provider counseling efficacy during routine primary care clinical encounters . If successful , the ADAPT system may represent an adaptable and scalable technology-enabled behavior-change tool for all primary care providers . Trial Registration Clinical Trials.gov Identifier', 'Objective . To study the effect of an educational videotape about poliovirus vaccines and choices of schedules for parents/guardians of children starting the polio vaccination series . Design . Prospect i ve , r and omized trial comparing two educational interventions . Setting . Five pediatric offices ( two university-based , two health maintenance organization staff models , and one private practice ) and a local health department immunization clinic in the greater Lansing , MI , area . Participants . A total of 287 parents/guardians of 2- to 3-month-olds presenting for well-child care and due for the first set of immunizations including poliovirus vaccine . Interventions . Parents/guardians were r and omized to read the vaccine information statement ( VIS ) alone or to read the VIS and view a 15-minute videotape about polio vaccination and choices of schedules produced by Michigan State University . The intervention groups were similar by race/ethnicity , education , and relationship to the child . Outcome Measures . Change in knowledge about the risk of poliomyelitis in the United States , transmission of poliomyelitis , characteristics of the two poliovirus vaccines , and choices of polio vaccination schedules ; and parent opinion on effectiveness of the interventions , as measured by pre- and postintervention question naires . Results . Both interventions result ed in increased test scores of knowledge . However , videotape viewers scored significantly higher on their posttest compared with parents/guardians assigned to VIS only . This significant increase was noted across all practice types , two of three major racial/ethnic groups , and educational levels . ( The increase for Hispanic parents/guardians approached significance ) . Reading the VIS did not improve posttest scores for videotape viewers . Reading the VIS did improve posttest scores for those assigned to VIS only , but these scores still were not as high as for videotape viewers who did not read the VIS . Conclusions . This study demonstrated that a complicated discussion of risks/ benefits of two vaccines and their schedules of administration could be communicated effectively via a videotaped presentation . In addition , the videotape was more effective than VIS alone in increasing short-term knowledge , regardless of practice type , race/ethnicity , or educational level . As immunization schedules increase in complexity and parents are asked to make more choices , videotaped information may be a better method to achieve the goal of truly informed consent', \"BACKGROUND The clinical benefit for depression of an interactive computer-assisted cognitive-behavioral program on CD-ROM , the Wellness Workshop ( WW ) , was evaluated in a r and omized controlled trial . METHOD A total of 191 individuals referred by primary -care physicians were r and omly assigned to a control group , where physician-directed treatment as usual ( TAU ) was provided , or to a treatment group , where TAU was supplemented with the WW CD-ROM , delivered by mail ( WW+TAU ) . Data were collected at baseline , at 6 weeks ' post-intervention , and at a 6-month follow-up assessment . Participants were given a strong incentive by a reimbursement of $ 75 for completion of each assessment . Measures included symptom ratings obtained via structured clinical diagnostic interviews , as well as a battery of self-report question naires on symptoms specifically targeted by the intervention . RESULTS Analysis of results demonstrated evidence for skill acquisition for improving dysfunctional thinking and reducing anxiety . Among those who met diagnostic criteria for depression , WW+TAU participants were three times more likely to remit at 6 weeks ' post-test than TAU participants . CONCLUSIONS The evidence supports the conclusion that the WW intervention added benefit to traditional care for depression . No placebo comparison group was included and the WW+TAU participants received slightly more attention ( a supportive telephone contact , ≤ 5 min from a psychologist 2 weeks after receiving the program ) . Overall , the findings add support to the accumulating evidence for the potential clinical benefit of computer-assisted behavioral health interventions\", 'Background Research to assess the effect of interventions to improve the processes of shared decision making and self-management directed at health care professionals is limited . Using the protocol of Intervention Mapping , a Web-based intervention directed at health care professionals was developed to complement and optimize health services in patient-centered care . Objective The objective of the Web-based intervention was to increase health care professionals ’ intention and encouraging behavior toward patient self-management , following cardiovascular risk management guidelines . Methods A r and omized controlled trial was used to assess the effect of a theory-based intervention , using a pre-test and post-test design . The intervention website consisted of a module to help improve professionals ’ behavior , a module to increase patients ’ intention and risk-reduction behavior toward cardiovascular risk , and a parallel module with a support system for the health care professionals . Health care professionals ( n=69 ) were recruited online and r and omly allocated to the  intervention group ( n=26 ) or ( waiting list ) control group ( n=43 ) , and invited their patients to participate . The outcome was improved professional behavior toward health education , and was self-assessed through question naires based on the Theory of Planned Behavior . Social-cognitive determinants , intention and behavior were measured pre-intervention and at 1-year follow-up . Results The module to improve professionals ’ behavior was used by 45 % ( 19/42 ) of the health care professionals in the intervention group . The module to support the health professional in encouraging behavior toward patients was used by 48 % ( 20/42 ) . The module to improve patients ’ risk-reduction behavior was provided to 44 % ( 24/54 ) of patients . In 1 of every 5 patients , the guideline for cardiovascular risk management was used . The Web-based intervention was poorly used . In the intervention group , no differences in social-cognitive determinants , intention and behavior were found for health care professionals , compared with the control group . We narrowed the intervention group and no significant differences were found in intention and behavior , except for barriers . Results showed a significant overall difference in barriers between the intervention and the control group ( F 1=4.128 , P=.02 ) . Conclusions The intervention was used by less than half of the participants and did not improve health care professionals ’ and patients ’ cardiovascular risk-reduction behavior . The website was not used intensively because of time and organizational constraints . Professionals in the intervention group experienced higher levels of barriers to encouraging patients , than professionals in the control group . No improvements were detected in the processes of shared decision making and patient self-management . Although participant education level was relatively high and the intervention was pre-tested , it is possible that the way the information was presented could be the reason for low participation and high dropout . Further research embedded in professionals ’ regular consultations with patients is required with specific emphasis on the processes of dissemination and implementation of innovations in patient-centered care .

Subjects : 1691 women booking antenatal care before 15 weeks ' gestation . Interventions : All participants received the usual information about prenatal tests from hospital staff . Individual participants were offered a separate session with a research midwife in which prenatal screening was described in detail . Class participants were offered the same extra information in an early prenatal class . Main outcome measures : Attendance at extra information sessions ; uptake rates of prenatal tests ; levels of anxiety , underst and ing , and satisfaction with decisions . Results : Attendance at classes was lower than at individual sessions ( adjusted odds ratio 0.45 ; 95 % confidence interval 0.35 to 0.58 ) .  Ultrasonography  was almost universally accepted ( 99 % ) and was not affected by either intervention . Uptake of cystic fibrosis testing , high in controls ( 79 % ) , was lowered in the individual group ( 0.44 ; 0.20 to 0.97 ) and classes ( 0.39 ; 0.18 to 0.86 ) . Uptake of screening for Down 's syndrome , already low ( 34 % ) in controls , was not further depressed by extra information in classes ( 0.99 ; 0.70 to 1.39 ) and was slightly higher in the individual group ( 1.45 ; 1.04 to 2.02 ) . Women offered extra information had improved underst and ing and were more satisfied with information received ; satisfaction with decisions about prenatal testing was unchanged . The offer of individual information reduced anxiety later in pregnancy . Conclusions : Ultrasonography is valued for non-medical reasons and chosen even by fully informed people who eschew prenatal diagnosis . The offer of extra information has no overall adverse effects on anxiety and reduces uptake of blood tests when background uptake rate is high ( but not when it is already low ) . High uptake of prenatal blood tests suggests compliant behaviour and need for more information\", \"Background Shared Decision Making ( SDM ) is regarded as the best practice model for the communicative challenge of decision making about treatment or diagnostic options . However , r and omized controlled trials focusing the effectiveness of SDM trainings are rare and existing measures of SDM are increasingly challenged by the latest research findings . This study will 1 ) evaluate a new physicians ' communication training regarding patient involvement in terms of SDM , 2 ) vali date SDMMASS , a new compound measure of SDM , and 3 ) evaluate the effects of SDM on the perceived quality of the decision process and on the elaboration of the decision . Methods In a multi-center r and omized controlled trial with a waiting control group , 40 physicians from 7 medical fields are enrolled . Each physician contributes a sequence of four medical consultations including a diagnostic or treatment decision . The intervention consists of two condensed video-based individual coaching sessions ( 15min . ) supported by a manual and a DVD . The interventions alternate with three measurement points plus follow up ( 6 months).Realized patient involvement is measured using the coefficient SDMMASS drawn from the Multifocal Approach to the Sharing in SDM ( MAPPIN'SDM ) which includes objective involvement , involvement as perceived by the patient , and the doctor-patient concordance regarding their judges of the involvement . For validation purpose s , all three components of SDMMASS are supplemented by similar measures , the OPTION observer scale , the Shared Decision Making Question naire ( SDM-Q ) and the dyadic application of the Decisional Conflict Scale ( DCS ) . Training effects are analyzed using t-tests . Spearman correlation coefficients are used to determine convergent validities , the influence of involvement ( SDMMASS ) on the perceived decision quality ( DCS ) and on the elaboration of the decision . The latter is operationalised by the ELAB coefficient from the UP24 ( Uncertainty Profile , 24 items version ) . Discussion Due to the rigorous blinded r and omized controlled design , the current trial promises valid and reliable results . On the one h and , we expect this condensed time-saving training to be adopted in clinical routine more likely than previous trainings . On the other h and , the exhaustivity of the MAPPIN'SDM measurement system qualifies it as a reference measure for simpler instruments and to deepen underst and ing of decision-making processes . Trial registration Current Controlled Trials IS RCT\", 'IMPORTANCE To make good decisions about prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) screening , men must consider how they value the different potential outcomes . OBJECTIVE To determine the effects of different methods of helping men consider such values . DESIGN AND SETTING R and omized trial from October 12 to 27 , 2011 , in the general community . PARTICIPANTS A total of 911 men aged 50 to 70 years from the United States and Australia who had average risk . Participants were drawn from online panels from a survey research firm in each country and were r and omized by the survey firm to 1 of 3 values clarification methods : a balance sheet ( n = 302 ) , a rating and ranking task ( n = 307 ) , or a discrete choice experiment ( n = 302 ) . INTERVENTION Participants underwent a values clarification task and then chose the most important attribute . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The main outcome was the difference among groups in the most important attribute . Secondary outcomes were differences in unlabeled test preference and intent to undergo screening with PSA . RESULTS The mean age was 59.8 years ; most participants were white and more than one-third had graduated from college . More than 40 % reported a PSA test within 12 months . The participants who received the rating and ranking task were more likely to report reducing the chance of death from prostate cancer as being most important ( 54.4 % ) compared with those who received the balance sheet ( 35.1 % ) or the discrete choice experiment ( 32.5 % ) ( P < .001 ) . Those receiving the balance sheet were more likely ( 43.7 % ) to prefer the unlabeled PSA-like option ( as opposed to the \" no screening\"-like option ) compared with those who received rating and ranking ( 34.2 % ) or the discrete choice experiment ( 20.2 % ) . However , the proportion who intended to undergo PSA testing was high and did not differ between groups ( balance sheet , 77.1 % ; rating and ranking , 76.8 % ; and discrete choice experiment , 73.5 % ; P = .73 ) . CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Different values clarification methods produce different patterns of attribute importance and different preferences for screening when presented with an unlabeled choice . Further studies with more distal outcome measures are needed to determine the best method of values clarification , if any , for decisions such as whether to undergo screening with PSA', \"OBJECTIVE Colorectal cancer ( CRC ) screening is underutilized . Effective and efficient interventions are needed to increase its utilization in primary care . METHODS We used UNC Internal Medicine electronic medical records to perform 2 effectiveness trials . Eligible patients had no documentation of recent CRC screening and were aged 50 - 75 years . The mailed intervention contained a letter documenting the need for screening signed by the attending physician in wave A and the practice director in wave B , a postcard to request a decision aid about CRC screening options , and information about how to obtain screening . RESULT Three-hundred and forty patients of attending physicians in wave A , 944 patients of resident physicians in wave B , and 214 patients of attending physicians in wave B were included . The intervention increased screening compared with controls for attending physicians ' patients in wave A ( 13.1 % vs. 4.1 % , 95 % CI , 3.1%-14.9 % ) but not for resident physicians ' patients in wave B ( 1.3 % vs. 1.9 % , 95 % CI , -2.2 % to 1.0 % ) . A small increase in screening  with  the intervention  was seen in attending physicians ' patients in wave B ( 6.9 % vs. 2.4 % , 95 % CI , -1.4 % to 10.5 % ) . Requests for decision aids were uncommon in both waves ( 12.5 % wave A and 7.8 % wave B ) . LIMITATIONS The group assignments were not individually r and omized , and covariate information to explain the differences in effect was limited . CONCLUSIONS The intervention increased CRC screening in attending physicians ' patients who received a letter from their physicians , but not resident physicians ' patients who received a letter signed by the practice director\", 'Background At an early stage , prostate cancer patients are often eligible for more than one treatment option , or may choose to defer curative treatment . Without a pre-existing superior option , a patient has to weigh his personal preferences against the risks and benefits of each alternative to select the most appropriate treatment . Given this context , in prostate cancer treatment decision-making , it is particularly suitable to follow the principles of shared decision-making ( SDM ) , especially with the support of specific instruments like decision aids ( DAs ) . Although several alternatives are available , present tools are not sufficiently compatible with routine clinical practice . To overcome existing barriers and to stimulate structural implementation of DAs and SDM in clinical practice , a web-based prostate cancer treatment DA was developed to fit clinical workflow . Following the structure of an existing DA , Dutch content was developed , and values clarification methods ( VCMs ) were added . The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of this DA on ( shared ) treatment choice and patient-reported outcomes . Methods / design Nineteen Dutch hospitals are included in a pragmatic , cluster r and omized controlled trial , with an intervention and a control arm . In the intervention group , the DA will be offered after diagnosis , and a summary of the patients ’ preferences , which were identified with the DA , can be discussed by the patient and his clinician during later consultation . Patients in the control group will receive information and decisional support as usual . Results from both groups on decisional conflict , treatment choice and the experience with involvement in the decision-making process are compared . Patients are requested to fill in question naires after treatment decision-making but before treatment is started , and 6 and 12 months later . This will allow the development of treatment satisfaction , decisional regret , and quality of life to be monitored . Clinicians from both groups will evaluate their practice of information provision and decisional support . Discussion This study will describe a web-based prostate cancer treatment DA with VCMs . The effect of this DA on the decision-making process and subsequent patient reported outcomes will be evaluated . Trial registration The Netherl and s National Trial Register : NTR4554 , registration date 1 May 2014', 'Background : People with sickle cell disease ( SCD ) or sickle cell trait ( SCT ) may not have information about genetic inheritance needed for making informed reproductive health decisions . CHOICES is a Web-based , multimedia educational intervention that provides information about reproductive options and consequences to help those with SCD or SCT identify and implement an informed parenting plan . Efficacy of CHOICES compared with usual care must be evaluated . Objective : The purpose was to compare immediate posttest effects of CHOICES versus an attention-control usual care intervention ( e-Book ) on SCD-/SCT-related reproductive health knowledge , intention , and behavior . Methods : In a r and omized controlled study , we recruited subjects with SCD/SCT from clinics , community setting s , and online networks with data collected at sites convenient to the 234 subjects with SCD ( n = 136 ) or SCT ( n = 98 ) . Their ages ranged from 18 to 35 years ; 65 % were women , and 94 % were African American . Subjects completed a measure of sickle cell reproductive knowledge , intention , and behavior before and immediately after the intervention . Results : Compared with the e-Book group , the CHOICES group had significantly higher average knowledge scores and probability of reporting a parenting plan to avoid SCD or SCD and SCT when pretest scores were controlled . Effects on intention and planned behavior were not significant . The CHOICES group showed significant change in their intention and planned behavior , whereas the e-Book group did not show significant change in their intention , but their planned behavior differed significantly . Discussion : Initial efficacy findings are encouraging but warrant planned booster sessions and outcome follow-ups to determine sustained intervention efficacy on reproductive health knowledge , intention , and actual behavior of persons with SCD/SCT', 'Purpose : Patients seeking genetic testing for inherited breast cancer risk are typically educated by genetic counselors ; however , the growing dem and for cancer genetic testing will likely exceed the availability of counselors trained in this area . We compared the effectiveness of counseling alone versus counseling preceded by use of a computer-based decision aid among women referred to genetic counseling for a family or personal history of breast cancer . Methods : We developed and evaluated an interactive computer program that educates women about breast cancer , heredity , and genetic testing . Between May 2000 and September 2002 , women at six study sites were r and omized into either :  Counselor Group ( n = 105 ) , who received st and ard genetic counseling , or Computer Group ( n = 106 ) , who used the interactive computer program before counseling . Clients and counselors both evaluated the effectiveness of counseling sessions , and counselors completed additional measures for the Computer Group . Counselors also recorded the duration of each session . Results : Baseline characteristics did not differ significantly between groups . Participants and counselors both rated the counseling sessions as highly effective , whether or not the sessions were preceded by computer use . Computer use result ed in significantly shorter counseling sessions among women at low risk for carrying BRCA1/2 mutations . In approximately half of the sessions preceded by clients ’ computer use , counselors indicated that clients ’ use of the computer program affected the way they used the time , shifting the focus away from basic education toward personal risk and decision-making . Conclusion : This study shows that the interactive computer program “ Breast Cancer Risk and Genetic Testing ” is a valuable adjunct to genetic counseling . Its use before counseling can shorten counseling sessions and allow counselors to focus more on the clients ’ individual risks and specific psychological concerns . As the dem and for counseling services increases , a program such as this can play a valuable role in enhancing counseling efficiency', \"Background By providing information on the relative merits and potential harms of the options available and a framework to clarify preferences , decision aids can improve knowledge and realistic expectations and decrease decisional conflict in individuals facing decisions between alternative forms of action . Decision-making about prenatal testing for fetal abnormalities is often confusing and difficult for women and the effectiveness of decision aids in this field has not been established . This study aims to test whether a decision aid for prenatal testing of fetal abnormalities , when compared to a pamphlet , improves women 's informed decision-making and decreases decisional conflict . Methods / design A cluster design ed r and omised controlled trial is being conducted in Victoria , Australia . Fifty General Practitioners ( GPs ) have been r and omised to one of two arms : providing women with either a decision aid or a pamphlet . The two primary outcomes will be measured by comparing the difference in percentages of women identified as making an informed choice and the difference in mean decisional conflict scores between the two groups . Data will be collected from women using question naires at 14 weeks and 24 weeks gestation . The sample size of 159 women in both arms of the trial has been calculated to detect a difference of 18 % ( 50 to 68 % ) in informed choice between the two groups . The required numbers have been adjusted to accommo date the cluster design , miscarriage and participant lost – to – follow up . Baseline characteristics of women will be summarised for both arms of the trial . Similarly , characteristics of GPs will be compared between arms . Differences in the primary outcomes will be analysed using ' intention-to-treat ' principles . Appropriate regression techniques will adjust for the effects of clustering and include covariates to adjust for the stratifying variable and major potential confounding factors . Discussion The findings from this trial will make a significant contribution to improving women 's experience of prenatal testing and will have application to a variety of maternity care setting s. The evaluation of a tailored decision aid will also have implication s for pregnancy care providers by identifying whether or not such a re source will support their role in providing prenatal testing information\", 'Background : Few interventions have proven effective in reducing the overuse of antibiotics for acute respiratory infections . We evaluated the effect of DECISION+2 , a shared decision-making training program , on the percentage of patients who decided to take  antibiotics  after consultation with a physician or resident . Methods : We performed a r and omized trial , clustered at the level of family practice teaching unit , with 2 study arms : DECISION+2 and control . The DECISION+2 training program included a 2-hour online tutorial followed by a 2-hour interactive seminar about shared decision-making . The primary outcome was the proportion of patients who decided to use antibiotics immediately after consultation . We also recorded patients ’ perception that shared decision-making had occurred . Two weeks after the initial consultation , we assessed patients ’ adherence to the decision , repeat consultation , decisional regret and quality of life . Results : We compared outcomes among 181 patients who consulted 77 physicians in 5 family practice teaching units in the DECISION+2 group , and 178 patients who consulted 72 physicians in 4 family practice teaching units in the control group . The percentage of patients who decided to use antibiotics after consultation was 52.2 % in the control group and 27.2 % in the DECISION+2 group ( absolute difference 25.0 % , adjusted relative risk 0.48 , 95 % confidence interval 0.34–0.68 ) . DECISION+2 was associated with patients taking a more active role in decision-making ( Z = 3.9 , p < 0.001 ) . Patient outcomes 2 weeks after consultation were similar in both groups . Interpretation : The shared decision-making program DECISION+2 enhanced patient participation in decision-making and led to fewer patients deciding to use antibiotics for acute respiratory infections . This reduction did not have a negative effect on patient outcomes 2 weeks after consultation . Clinical Trials.gov trial register no.

We aim to determine whether the previously proven CHOICE program can be replicated at multiple sites and whether ongoing reinforcement further improves risk factor modification . Methods / design Participants eligible for but not accessing st and ard cardiac rehabilitation will be r and omly allocated to either a previously tested 3-month CHOICE program or a 30-month CHOICE program ( CHOICE-plus ) .  Both groups will participate in individualised risk factor modules of differing duration that involve choice , goal setting and telephone follow-up for three months . CHOICE-plus will also receive additional face-to-face and telephone reinforcement between three and 30 months . At one site we will recruit a r and omised control group , receiving conventional care . Primary outcomes are lipid levels , blood pressure , physical activity levels and smoking rates . Secondary outcomes include readmission rates , death , the number of risk factors , other modifiable risk factors , quality of life and process evaluation measures over three years .

Within two prostate cancer screening programs , we evaluated the impact of a print-based decision aid ( DA ) on decision-making outcomes . METHODS Men ( N=543 ) were 54.9 ( SD=8.1 ) years old and 61 % were African-American . The 2(booklet type : DA vs. usual care (UC)) × 2(delivery mode : Home vs. Clinic ) r and omized controlled trial assessed decisional and screening outcomes at baseline , 2-months , and 13-months . RESULTS Intention-to-treat linear regression analyses using generalized estimating equations revealed that DA participants reported improved knowledge relative to UC ( B=.41 , p<.05 ) . For decisional conflict , per- protocol analyses revealed a group by time interaction ( B=-.69 , p<.05 ) , indicating that DA participants were less likely to report decisional conflict at 2-months compared to UC participants ( OR=.49 , 95 % CI : .26-.91 , p<.05 ) . CONCLUSION This is the first r and omized trial to evaluate a DA in the context of free mass screening , a challenging setting in which to make an informed decision . The DA was highly utilized by participants , improved knowledge and reduced decisional conflict . PRACTICE IMPLICATION S These results are valuable in underst and ing ways to improve the decisions of men who seek screening and can be easily implemented within many setting', \"Background Most women use some method of pain relief during labour . There is extensive research evidence available of pharmacological pain relief during labour ; however this evidence is not readily available to pregnant women . Decision aids are tools that present evidence based information and allow preference elicitation . Methods We developed a labour analgesia decision aid . Using a RCT design women either received a decision aid or a pamphlet .  Eligible women were primiparous , ≥ 37 weeks , planning a vaginal birth of a single infant and had sufficient English to complete the trial material s. We used a combination of affective ( anxiety , satisfaction and participation in decision-making ) and behavioural outcomes ( intention and analgesia use ) to assess the impact of the decision aid , which were assessed before labour . Results 596 women were r and omised ( 395 decision aid group , 201 pamphlet group ) . There were significant differences in knowledge scores between the decision aid group and the pamphlet group ( mean difference 8.6 , 95 % CI 3.70 , 13.40 ) . There were no differences between decisional conflict scores ( mean difference -0.99 ( 95 % CI -3.07 , 1.07 ) , or anxiety ( mean difference 0.3 , 95 % CI -2.15 , 1.50 ) . The decision aid group were significantly more likely to consider their care providers opinion ( RR 1.28 95%CI 0.64 , 0.95 ) . There were no differences in analgesia use and poor follow through between antenatal analgesia intentions and use . Conclusions This decision aid improves women 's labour analgesia knowledge without increasing anxiety . Significantly , the decision aid group were more informed of labour analgesia options , and considered the opinion of their care providers more often when making their analgesia decisions , thus improving informed decision making . Trial Registration Trial registration no : IS RCT\", 'Abstract The current study examined the effects of providing treatment progress information and problem-solving tools to both patients and therapists during the course of psychotherapy . Three hundred and seventy patients were r and omly assigned to one of two treatment groups : treatment-as-usual , or an experimental condition based on the use of patient/therapist feedback and clinical decision-support tools . Patients in the feedback condition were significantly more improved at termination than the patients in the treatment-as-usual condition . Treatment effects were not a consequence of different amounts of psychotherapy received by experimental and control clients . These findings are consistent with past research on these approaches although the effect size was smaller in this study . Not all therapists were aided by the feedback intervention', 'Background The impact of decision aids on prostate cancer screening outcomes has been inconsistent . Purpose We assessed whether pre-existing attitudes moderated the impact of decision aids on screening . Methods Men aged 45–70 ( 56.2 % Caucasian , 39.9 % African-American ) were r and omly assigned to a print decision aid ( N = 630 ) , a web decision aid ( N = 631 ) , or usual care ( N = 632 ) . Telephone interviews assessed pro/con screening attitudes and screening behaviors at baseline , 1-month and 13-months post-r and omization . Results Logistic regression analyses revealed significant arm by attitude interactions : Higher baseline cons scores predicted lower screening in the print ( OR = 0.60 ( 95 % CI : 0.40 , 0.92 ) ) and web ( OR = 0.61 ( 95 % CI : 0.40 , 0.91 ) ) arms but not in usual care ( OR = 1.34 ( 95 % CI : 0.90 , 2.00 ) ) . Conclusions The decision aids amplified the impact of men ’s baseline attitudes about limitations of screening : Compared to the usual care arm , men in both decision aid arms were less likely to be screened when they perceived more limitations of screening', \"Background Different presentations of treatment effects can affect decisions . However , previous studies have not evaluated which presentations best help people make decisions that are consistent with their own values . We undertook a pilot study to compare different methods for doing this . Methods and Findings We conducted an Internet-based r and omized trial comparing summary statistics for communicating the effects of statins on the risk of coronary heart disease ( CHD ) . Participants rated the relative importance of treatment consequences using  visual analogue scales ( VAS ) and category rating scales ( CRS ) with five response options . We r and omized participants to either VAS or CRS first and to one of six summary statistics : relative risk reduction ( RRR ) and five absolute measures of effect : absolute risk reduction , number needed to treat , event rates , tablets needed to take , and natural frequencies ( whole numbers ) . We used logistic regression to determine the association between participants ' elicited values and treatment choices . 770 participants age 18 or over and literate in English completed the study . In all , 13 % in the VAS-first group failed to complete their VAS rating , while 9 % of the CRS-first group failed to complete their scoring ( p = 0.03 ) . Different ways of weighting the elicited values had little impact on the analyses comparing the different presentations . Most ( 51 % ) preferred the RRR compared to the other five summary statistics ( 1 % to 25 % , p = 0.074 ) . However , decisions in the group presented the RRR deviated substantially from those made in the other five groups . The odds of participants in the RRR group deciding to take statins were 3.1 to 5.8 times that of those in the other groups across a wide range of values ( p = 0.0007 ) . Participants with a scientific background , who were more numerate or had more years of education were more likely to decide not to take statins . Conclusions Internet-based trials comparing different presentations of treatment effects are feasible , but recruiting participants is a major challenge . Despite a slightly higher response rate for CRS , VAS is preferable to avoid approximation of a continuous variable . Although most participants preferred the RRR , participants shown the RRR were more likely to decide to take statins regardless of their values compared with participants who were shown any of the five other summary statistics .

METHODS Unaffected Australian men ( 40 - 79 years ) with at least one affected relative completed the first online question naire , were r and omized to read either the tailored DA ( intervention ) or nontailored information about prostate cancer screening ( control ) , then completed a question naire postreading and 12 months later . The primary outcome was decisional conflict regarding prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) testing . The impact of the DA on longitudinal outcomes was analyzed by using r and om intercept mixed effects models . Logistic and linear regressions were used to analyze the impact of the DA on screening behavior and decision regret . Stage of decision-making was tested as a moderator for decisional conflict and decision regret . The frequency of online material access was recorded . RESULTS The DA had no effect on decisional conflict , knowledge , inclination toward PSA testing , accuracy of perceived risk , or screening behavior . However , among men considering PSA testing , those who read the DA  had lower decision regret compared with men who read the control material s , β = 0.34 , p < .001 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) = [ .22 , .53 ] . CONCLUSIONS This is the first study to our knowledge to evaluate the uptake and efficacy of an  online screening DA among men with a family history of prostate cancer . Men who were undecided about screening at baseline benefitted from the DA , experiencing less regret 12 months later . In relation to decisional conflict , the control material s may have operated as a less complex and equally informative DA', 'Background . Making informed decisions about cancer screening involves underst and ing the benefits and harms in conjunction with personal values . There is little research examining factors associated with informed decision making or participation in screening in the context of a decision aid trial . Objectives . To identify factors associated with informed choice and participation in fecal occult blood testing ( FOBT ) among lower education population s. Design . R and omized controlled trial of an FOBT decision aid conducted between July and November 2008 . Setting . Socioeconomically disadvantaged areas in New South Wales , Australia . Participants . Included 572 adults aged 55 to 64 years with lower education . Measurements . Sociodemographic variables , perceived health literacy , and involvement preferences in decision making were examined to identify predictors of informed choice ( knowledge , attitudes , and behavior ) . Results . Multivariate analysis identified independent predictors of making an informed choice as having higher education ( relative risk [ RR ] , 1.49 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 1.13–1.95 ; P = 0.001 ) , receiving the decision aid ( RR , 2.88 ; 95 % CI , 1.87–4.44 ; P < 0.001 ) , and being male ( RR , 1.48 ; 95 % CI , 1.11–1.97 ; P = 0.009 ) . Participants with no confidence in completing forms and poorer self-reported health were less likely to make an informed choice ( RR , 0.74 ; 95 % CI , 0.53–1.03 ; P = 0.05 and RR , 0.57 ; 95 % CI , 0.36–0.89 ; P = 0.007 , respectively ) . Independent predictors of completing the FOBT were positive screening attitudes , receiving the st and ard information , preference for making the decision alone , and knowing that screening may lead to false-positive/negative results . Limitations . We did not objective ly measure health literacy . Conclusions . Participants with the lowest levels of education had greater difficulties making an informed choice about participation in bowel screening . Alternative methods are needed to support informed decision making among lower education population', 'OBJECTIVE Genetic testing is increasingly part of routine clinical care for women with a family history of breast cancer . Given their substantially elevated risk for breast cancer , BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation carriers must make the difficult decision whether or not to opt for risk reducing mastectomy . To help BRCA1/2 carriers make this decision , the authors developed a computer-based interactive decision aid that was tested against usual care in a r and omized controlled trial . DESIGN After the completion of genetic counseling , 214 female ( aged 21 - 75 ) BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation carriers were r and omized to Usual Care  ( UC ; N = 114 ) or Usual Care plus Decision Aid ( DA ; N = 100 ) arms . UC participants received no additional intervention . DA participants were sent the CD-ROM DA to view at home . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The authors measured final management decision , decisional conflict , decisional satisfaction , and receipt of risk reducing mastectomy at 1- , 6- , and 12-months postr and omization . RESULTS Longitudinal analyses revealed that the DA was effective among carriers who were initially undecided about how to manage their breast cancer risk . Within this group , the DA led to an increased likelihood of reaching a management decision ( OR = 3.09 , 95 % CI = 1.62 , 5.90 ; p < .001 ) , decreased decisional conflict ( B = -.46 , z = -3.1 , p < 002 ) , and increased satisfaction ( B = .27 , z = 3.1 , p = .002 ) compared to UC . Among carriers who had already made a management decision by the time of r and omization , the DA had no benefit relative to UC . CONCLUSION These results demonstrate that BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation carriers who are having difficulty making a breast cancer risk management decision can benefit from adjunct decision support', 'OBJECTIVE To examine the impact of a decision aid ( DA ) design ed to promote informed decision making for screening with the prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) test and to test a theoretical model of factors influencing decisional conflict . DESIGN Structural equation modeling examined pathways between DA exposure , knowledge , schema , prostate cancer risk perceptions , decisional anxiety , and decisional conflict .  Sample participants included 200 men from the general population ( exclusive of African Americans ) and 200 African American men . Half of the men in each sub sample were r and omly assigned to receive the DA . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Decisional conflict regarding prostate cancer screening . RESULTS The DA influences level of decisional conflict by increasing patient knowledge . This effect of knowledge on decisional conflict is indirect , however , through an association with greater perceived risk and lower decisional anxiety . Also , positive PSA schema was associated with lower decisional anxiety and decisional conflict . It is important that exposure to the DA had no impact on PSA schema . CONCLUSION Schemas about testing must be considered in developing messages about the risks and benefits of testing . If schemas are counter to message content , mechanisms for modifying schemas must be incorporated into interventions', 'OBJECTIVE To experimentally test whether using pictographs ( image matrices ) , incremental risk formats , and varied risk denominators would influence perceptions and comprehension of side effect risks in an online decision aid about prophylactic use of tamoxifen to prevent primary breast cancers . METHODS We recruited 631 women with elevated breast cancer risk from two healthcare organizations . Participants saw tailored estimates of the risks of 5 side effects : endometrial cancer , blood clotting , cataracts , hormonal symptoms , and sexual problems . Presentation format was r and omly varied in a three factor design : ( A ) risk information was displayed either in pictographs or numeric text ; ( B ) presentations either reported total risks with and without tamoxifen or highlighted the incremental risk most relevant for decision making ; and ( C ) risk estimates used 100 or 1000 person denominators . Primary outcome measures included risk perceptions and gist knowledge . RESULTS Incremental risk formats consistently lowered perceived risk of side effects but result ed in low knowledge when displayed by numeric text only . Adding pictographs , however , produced significantly higher comprehension levels . CONCLUSIONS Pictographs make risk statistics easier to interpret , reducing biases associated with incremental risk presentations . PRACTICE IMPLICATION S Including graphs in risk communications is essential to support an informed treatment decision-making process', \"BACKGROUND Poor quality of information transfer about the benefits and risks of statin drug use may result in patients not making informed decisions that they can act on in a timely fashion . METHODS The effect of a decision aid about statin drugs on treatment decision making in 98 patients with diabetes was determined in a cluster r and omized trial of decision aid vs control pamphlet , with concealed allocation , blinding of participants to study goals , and adherence to the intention-to-treat principle . Twenty-one endocrinologists conducted specialty outpatient metabolic consultations . Patients in the intervention group received Statin Choice , a tailored decision aid that presents the estimated 10-year cardiovascular risk , the absolute risk reduction with use of statin drugs , and the disadvantages of using statin drugs . Patients in the control group received the institution 's pamphlet about cholesterol management . We measured acceptability , knowledge about options and cardiovascular risk , and decisional conflict immediately after the visit , and adherence to pill taking was measured 3 months later . RESULTS Patients favored using the decision aid ( odds ratio [ OR ] , 2.8 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 1.2 - 6.9 ) ; patients who received the decision aid ( n = 52 ) knew more ( difference , 2.4 of 9 points ; 95 % CI , 1.5 - 3.3 ) , had better estimated cardiovascular risk ( OR , 22.4 ; 95 % CI , 5.9 - 85.6 ) and potential absolute risk reduction with statin drugs ( OR , 6.7 ; 95 % CI , 2.2 - 19.7 ) , and had less decisional conflict ( difference , -10.6 ; 95 % CI , -15.4 to -5.9 on a 100-point scale ) than did patients in the control group ( n = 46 ) . Of 33 patients in the intervention group taking statin drugs at 3 months , 2 reported missing 1 dose or more in the last week compared with 6 of 29 patients in the control group taking statin drugs ( OR , 3.4 ; 95 % CI , 1.5 - 7.5 ) . CONCLUSIONS A decision aid enhanced decision making about statin drugs and may have favorably affected drug adherence\", 'The purpose of this study was to determine if providing men with information about screening for prostate cancer would enable them to assume a more active role in decision making with their family physician , and lower levels of anxiety and decisional conflict .  Men were recruited from one family medical clinic in Winnipeg , Manitoba . One hundred men scheduled for a periodic health examination ( PHE ) were r and omly assigned to receive verbal and written information either prior to the PHE , or following the second interview . Men completed measures of preferred decisional role and anxiety prior to the PHE ; and assumed decisional role , decisional conflict , and anxiety post PHE . Results demonstrated that men who received the information prior to the PHE assumed a significantly more active role in making a screening decision , and had lower levels of decisional conflict post PHE . The two groups did not differ with regard to levels of state anxiety . Providing men with information enables them to make informed screening decisions with their family physicians', 'Background The prevalence of chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes and chronic low back pain is rising . Patient empowerment is a key strategy in the management of chronic diseases . Patient empowerment can be fostered by Web-based interactive health communication applications ( IHCAs ) that combine health information with decision support , social support , and /or behavioral change support . Tailoring the content and tone of IHCAs to the needs of individual patients might improve their effectiveness . Objective The main objective was to test the effectiveness of a Web-based , tailored , fully automated IHCA for patients with type 2 diabetes or chronic low back pain against a st and ard website with identical content without tailoring ( control condition ) on patients ’ knowledge and empowerment . Methods We performed a blinded r and omized trial with a parallel design . In the intervention group , the content was delivered in dialogue form , tailored to relevant patient characteristics . In the control group , the sections of the text were presented in a content tree without any tailoring . Participants were recruited online and offline and were blinded to their group assignments . Measurements were taken at baseline ( t0 ) , directly after the first visit ( t1 ) , and at 3-month follow-up ( t2 ) . The primary hypothesis was that the tailored IHCA would have larger effects on knowledge and patient empowerment ( primary outcomes ) than the control website . The secondary outcomes were decisional conflict and preparation for decision making . All measurements were conducted by online self-report question naires . Intention-to-treat ( ITT ) and available cases ( AC ) analyses were performed for all outcomes . Results A total of 561 users agreed to participate in the study . Of these , 179 ( 31.9 % ) had type 2 diabetes and 382 ( 68.1 % ) had chronic low back pain . Usage was significantly higher in the tailored system ( mean 51.2 minutes ) than in the control system ( mean 37.6 minutes ; P<.001 ) . Three months after system use , 52.4 % of the sample was retained . There was no significant intervention effect in the ITT analysis . In the AC analysis , participants using the tailored system displayed significantly more knowledge at t1 ( P=.02 ) and more emotional well-being ( subscale of empowerment ) at t2 ( P=.009 ) . The estimated mean difference between the groups was 3.9 ( 95 % CI 0.5 - 7.3 ) points for knowledge and 25.4 ( 95 % CI 6.3 - 44.5 ) points for emotional well-being on a 0 - 100 points scale . Conclusions The primary analysis did not support the study hypothesis . However , content tailoring and interactivity may increase knowledge and reduce health-related negative effects in persons who use IHCAs . There were no main effects of the intervention on other dimensions of patient empowerment or decision-related outcomes . This might be due to our tailored IHCA being , at its core , an educational intervention offering health information in a personalized , empathic fashion that merely additionally provides decision support . Tailoring and interactivity may not make a difference with regard to these outcomes .

However , implementation of and fidelity to the treatment algorithm among various providers was observed to be inadequate . A computerized decision support system ( CDSS ) for the implementation of the TMAP algorithm for depression has since been developed to improve fidelity and adherence to the algorithm . METHOD This was a 2-group , parallel design , clinical trial ( one patient group receiving MDD treatment from physicians using the CDSS and the other patient group receiving usual care ) conducted at 2 separate primary care clinics in Texas from March 2005 through June 2006 . Fifty-five patients with MDD ( DSM-IV criteria ) with no significant difference in disease characteristics were enrolled , 32 of whom were treated by physicians using CDSS and 23 were treated by physicians using usual care .  The study 's objective was to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of implementing a CDSS to assist physicians acutely treating patients with MDD compared to usual care in primary care . Primary efficacy outcomes for depression symptom severity were based on the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ( HDRS(17 ) ) evaluated by an independent rater . RESULTS Patients treated by physicians employing CDSS had significantly greater symptom reduction , based on the HDRS(17 ) , than patients treated with usual care ( P < .001 ) . CONCLUSIONS The CDSS algorithm , utilizing measurement-based care , was superior to usual care for patients with MDD in primary care setting s.

Based upon a detailed needs assessment with diverse stakeholders , pamphlet and video decision aids for destination therapy left ventricular assist devices ( DT LVAD ) were developed to help patients and their caregivers think through , forecast , and deliberate their options . These decision aids are the foundation of the Multicenter Trial of a Shared Decision Support Intervention for Patients and their Caregivers Offered Destination  Therapy for  End-Stage Heart Failure ( DECIDE-LVAD ) study , a multicenter , r and omized trial aim ed at underst and ing the effectiveness and implementation of a shared decision support intervention for patients considering DT LVAD .  Methods / Design : A stepped-wedge r and omized controlled trial was design ed , guided by the RE- AIM framework and modeled after an effectiveness-implementation hybrid type II design . Six DT LVAD programs from across the United States will participate . Primary outcomes include knowledge and values-treatment concordance .  Patients with advanced heart failure who are being considered for DT LVAD and their caregivers are eligible with a target enrollment of 168 dyads . From August 2014 to January 2015 , an acceptability and feasibility pilot study was performed , which clarified opportunities and challenges around decision support for DT LVAD and result ed in significant modifications to the DECIDE-LVAD study .

To explore the important predictors of intention to be tested in men who received the brief pDA .  METHODS A brief pDA design ed to facilitate informed decision-making for men considering PSA testing was developed for the NHS Prostate Cancer Risk Management Programme . Men aged 40 - 75 years selected from 11 General Practice s in Engl and and Wales were r and omised to receive either a mailed copy of the brief pDA and a question naire ( intervention group ) , or a question naire alone ( control group ) . The question naire assessed knowledge , attitudes , perceived risk and intention to have a PSA test and , for the intervention group , their perceptions of the brief pDA . RESULTS Nine hundred and ninety of the men who were eligible for the study returned completed question naires ( response rate=54 % ) . Men who received the brief pDA had significantly higher knowledge scores ( p<0.0001 ) and less positive attitudes ( p<0.0001 ) regarding PSA testing than men in the control group . There was no significant difference between the two groups in intention to be tested within the next 12 months . 87 % of men found the brief pDA was easy to read , 94 % considered it contained about the right amount of detail and 94 % felt the information was presented in a balanced way . Multivariate analysis identified perceived risk ( p<0.0001 ) , perceived benefits of PSA testing ( p<0.0001 ) , knowledge ( p=0.004 ) , attitude ( p=0.007 ) and age ( p=0.01 ) as the most important independent predictors of intention to be tested amongst men in the intervention group . CONCLUSION The brief pDA was shown to dramatically increase  men 's knowledge of the benefits and risks of the PSA test . Men who received the brief pDA were significantly less positive about the PSA test , although there was no difference between the two groups regarding their intention to be tested within the next year . PRACTICE IMPLICATION S This brief pDA could serve as an acceptable and low cost adjunct to counselling by the General Practitioner ( GP ) , and should promote informed decision making regarding the PSA test . Further research is required to ascertain the utility of the decision aid during the consultation\", 'OBJECTIVE The purpose of this trial was to compare usual patient education plus the Internet-based Personal Patient Profile-Prostate , vs. usual education alone , on conflict associated with decision making , plus explore time-to-treatment , and treatment choice . METHODS A r and omized , multi-center clinical trial was conducted with measures at baseline , 1- , and 6 months . Men with newly diagnosed localized prostate cancer ( CaP ) who sought consultation at urology , radiation oncology , or multi-disciplinary clinics in 4 geographically-distinct American cities were recruited . Intervention group participants used the Personal Patient Profile-Prostate , a decision support system comprised of customized text and video coaching regarding potential outcomes , influential factors , and communication with care providers . The primary outcome , patient-reported decisional conflict , was evaluated over time using generalized estimating equations to fit generalized linear models . Additional outcomes , time-to-treatment , treatment choice , and program acceptability/usefulness , were explored . RESULTS A total of 494 eligible men were r and omized ( 266 intervention ; 228 control ) . The intervention reduced adjusted decisional conflict over time compared with the control group , for the uncertainty score ( estimate -3.61 ; ( confidence interval , -7.01 , 0.22 ) , and values clarity ( estimate -3.57 ; confidence interval ( -5.85,-1.30 ) . Borderline effect was seen for the total decisional conflict score ( estimate -1.75 ; confidence interval ( -3.61,0.11 ) . Time-to-treatment was comparable between groups , while undecided men in the intervention group chose brachytherapy more often than in the control group . Acceptability and usefulness were highly rated . CONCLUSION The Personal Patient Profile-Prostate is the first intervention to significantly reduce decisional conflict in a multi-center trial of American men with newly diagnosed localized CaP. Our findings support efficacy of P3P for addressing decision uncertainty and facilitating patient selection of a CaP treatment that is consistent with the patient values and preferences', \"OBJECTIVES Aim of this RCT was to evaluate whether the added use of a decision board ( DB ) during shared decision-making improves patients ' knowledge as for different treatment options and overall satisfaction with the consultation . METHODS Forty-nine undergraduate students were trained in shared decision-making ( SDM ) and evaluated by an Objective Structured Clinical Examination ( OSCE ) . According to their test results , all participants were r and omly allocated to either the test- ( DB ) or the control-group ( Non-DB ) . Both groups performed SDM with patients showing a defect in a posterior tooth ( Class-II defect ) . Prior to the interview , patients of the DB group were given the decision aid for review . In the Non-DB group , patients were consulted without additional aids . After treatment decision , a question naire was completed by all patients to measure knowledge ( costs , survival rate , characteristics and treatment time ) and overall satisfaction with the consultation . Fifty DB patients and 31 Non-DB patients completed the question naire . RESULTS DB patients ( n = 50 ) demonstrated a statistically significant increase in knowledge compared to the Non-DB group ( n = 31 ) ( Mann-Whitney U-test ; DB group = 10.04 ; Non-DB group = 4.16 ; P = 0.004 ) . There was no significant difference between groups regarding satisfaction with the consultation ( t-test ; P > 0.05 ) . CONCLUSIONS During the shared decision-making process , the use of a decision board yielding information about Class-II treatment options leads to a significantly higher patient knowledge compared to knowledge gained through consultation alone . It is therefore desirable to provide DBs for dental diagnoses with several treatment options to increase transparency for the patient\", \"Abstract Background Low utilization of effective coronary heart disease ( CHD ) prevention strategies may be due to many factors , but chief among them is the lack of patient involvement in prevention decisions . We undertook this study to test the effectiveness of an individually-tailored , computerized decision aid about CHD on patients ' discussion s with their doctor and their plans for CHD prevention . Methods We conducted a pilot r and omized trial in a convenience sample of adults with no previous history of cardiovascular disease to test the effectiveness of an individually-tailored , computerized decision aid about CHD prevention against a risk factor list that patients could present to their doctor . Results We enrolled 75 adults . Mean age was 53 . 59 % were female , 73 % white , and 23 % African-American . 66 % had some college education . 43 % had a 10-year CHD risk of 0–5 % , 25 % a risk of 6–10 % , 24 % a risk of 11–20 % , and 5 % a risk of > 20 % . 78 % had at least one option to reduce their CHD risk , but only 45 % accurately identified the strategies best supported by evidence . 41 patients received the decision aid  , 34 received  usual care . In unadjusted analysis , the decision aid increased the proportion of patients who discussed CHD risk reduction with their doctor from 24 % to 40 % ( absolute difference 16 % ; 95 % CI -4 % to + 37 % ) and increased the proportion who had a specific plan to reduce their risk from 24 % to 37 % ( absolute difference 13 % ; 95 % CI -7 % to + 34 % ) . In pre-post testing , the decision aid also appeared to increase the proportion of patients with plans to intervene on their CHD risk ( absolute increase ranging from 21 % to 47 % for planned medication use and 5 % to 16 % for planned behavioral interventions ) . Conclusion Our study confirms patients ' limited knowledge about their CHD risk and effective risk reduction options and provides preliminary evidence that an individually-tailored decision aid about CHD prevention might be expected to increase patients ' discussion s about CHD prevention with their doctor and their plans for CHD risk reduction . These findings should be replicated in studies with a larger sample size and patients at overall higher risk of CHD . Trial Registration : Clinical Trials.gov\", 'Background . There is limited evidence about how to ensure that patients are helped to make informed medical care decisions . Objective . To test a decision support intervention for uterine fibroid treatments . Design and Setting . Practical clinical trial to test informed choice assistance in 4 r and omly assigned gynecology clinics compared to 5 others providing a pamphlet . Patients . Three hundred women facing a treatment decision for fibroids over a 13-month period . Intervention . Mailed DVD and brochure about fibroid treatments plus the Ottawa decision guide and an offer of counseling soon after an index visit . Measurements . Mailed survey 6 to 8 weeks later asking about knowledge , preferences , and satisfaction with decision support . Results . In total , 244 surveys were completed for an adjusted response rate of 85.4 % . On a 5-point scale , intervention subjects reported more treatment options being mentioned ( 3.0 v. 2.4 ) , had a higher knowledge score ( 3.3 v. 2.8 ) , and were more likely to report being adequately informed ( 4.4 v. 4.0 ) , and their decision was both more satisfactory ( 4.3 v. 4.0 ) and more consistent with their personal values ( 4.5 v. 4.2 ) . Neither knowledge nor use of the intervention was associated with greater concordance between preferences and decisions . Limitations . Implementation of intervention may not have been well timed to the decision for some patients , limiting their use of the material s and counseling . Conclusion . It is difficult to integrate structured decision support consistently into practice . Decision support for benign uterine conditions showed effects on knowledge and satisfaction but not on concordance', \"BACKGROUND Women overestimate both population and individual risk of cervical cancer . This may contribute to the recognised excess screening frequency for low-risk women . AIM To investigate whether an individualized risk communication package could affect stated preferences for screening interval and actual screening behaviour . DESIGN Pragmatic , practice -based cluster r and omised controlled trial . SETTING Twenty-nine practice s ( 15 intervention , 14 control ) in North Wales recruited 1890 women attending for cervical smears . METHOD A risk communication package containing visual material was compared with normal practice . Practice nurses received training in its delivery . The short-term primary outcome was stated preference for screening interval ; the long-term primary outcome was actual screening behaviour . RESULTS In the short term , intervention arm women were significantly less likely to prefer a shorter than recommended interval ( odds ratio [ OR ] = 0.51 , 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] = 0.41 to 0.64 ; P < 0.0001 ) . At the five-year follow-up , fewer women in the intervention arm had attended for screening sooner than their recommended recall . The magnitude of difference in excess screening interval preference and behaviour was similar , but behaviour had a wider confidence interval and a marginally non-significant P-value ( OR = 0.61 , 95 % CI = 0.36 to 1.03 ; P = 0.063 ) . Better knowledge and more accurate risk perceptions were demonstrated , with an improvement in measures of anxiety . The extra cost per woman receiving the intervention was 6 Pounds . CONCLUSIONS Women 's perception of risk contributes to determining screening intervals in addition to practice factors . Simple risk information delivered in primary care affected women 's stated preferences for tests . The impact on actual screening behaviour was more equivocal . Overall , the intervention showed a substantial benefit and any disbenefit can be ruled out . This approach to providing risk information could , at low cost , benefit other screening programmes and may relieve anxiety\", 'Background Evaluation of the effectiveness of a patient decision aid ( nurse-managed telephone support line and /or colorectal cancer screening website ) , distributed to patients by their family physician , in improving  fecal occult blood test ( FOBT ) colorectal cancer screening rates . Methods A pragmatic , two arm , cluster r and omized controlled trial in Winnipeg , Manitoba , Canada ( 39 medical clinic clusters ; 79 fee-for-service family physicians ; 2,395 average risk patients ) . All physicians followed their st and ard clinical screening practice . Intervention group physicians provided a fridge magnet to patients that facilitated patient decision aid access . Primary endpoint was FOBT screening rate within four months . Multi-level logistic regression to determine effect of cluster , physician , and patient level factors on patient FOBT completion rate . ICC determined . Results Family physicians were r and omized to control ( n = 39 ) and intervention ( n = 40 ) groups . Compared to controls ( 56.9 % ; n = 663/1165 ) , patients receiving the intervention had a higher FOBT completion rate ( 66.6 % ; n = 805/1209 ; OR of 1.47 ; 95 % confidence interval 1.06 to 2.03 ; p < 0.02 ) . Patient aid utilization was low ( 1.1 % ; 13/1,221 ) and neither internet nor telephone access affected screening rates for the intervention group . FOBT screening rates differed among clinics and physicians ( p < 0.0001 ) . Patients whose physician promoted the FOBT were more likely to complete it ( 65 % ; n = 1140/1755 ) compared to those whose physician did not ( 51.1 % ; n = 242/470 ; p < 0.0001 ; OR of 1.54 and 95 % CI of 1.23 to 1.92 ) . Patients reporting they had done an FOBT in the past were more likely to complete the test ( 70.6 % ; n = 1141/1616 ; p < 0.0001 ; 95 % CI 2.51 to 3.73 ) than those who had not ( 43 % ; n = 303/705 ) . Patients 50–59 years old had lower screening rates compared to those over 60 ( p < 0.0001 ) . 75 % of patients completing the test did so in 34 days . Conclusion Despite minimal use of the patient aid , intervention group patients were more likely to complete the FOBT . Powerful strategies to increase colorectal cancer screening rates include a recommendation to do the test from the family physician and focusing efforts on patients age 50–59 years to ensure they complete their first FOBT.Trial registration Trial registration number : clinical trials.gov identifier NCT01026753', 'Background Chronic low back pain is a common chronic condition whose treatment success can be improved by active involvement of patients . Patient involvement can be fostered by web-based applications combining health information with decision support or behaviour change support . These so-called Interactive Health Communication Applications ( IHCAs ) can reach great numbers of patients at low financial cost and provide information and support at the time , place and learning speed patients prefer . However , high attrition often seems to decrease the effects of web-based interventions . Tailoring content and tone of IHCAs to the individual patient ́s needs might improve usage and therefore effectiveness . This study aims to evaluate a tailored IHCA for people with chronic low back pain combining health information with decision support and behaviour change support . Methods / Design The tailored IHCA will be tested regarding effectiveness and usage against a st and ard website with identical content in a single-blinded r and omized trial with a parallel design . The IHCA contains information on chronic low back pain and its treatment options including health behaviour change recommendations . In the intervention group the content is delivered in dialogue form , tailored to relevant patient characteristics ( health literacy , coping style ) . In the control group there is no tailoring , a st and ard web-page is used for presenting the content . Participants are unaware of group assignment . Eligibility criteria are age ≥ 18 years , self- reported chronic low back pain , and Internet access . To detect the expected small effect ( Cohen ’s d = 0.2 ) , the sample aims to include 414 patients , with assessment s at baseline , directly after the first on-page visit , and at 3-month follow-up using online self-report question naires . It is expected that the tailored IHCA has larger effects on knowledge and patient empowerment ( primary outcomes ) compared to a st and ard website . Secondary outcomes are website usage , preparation for decision making , and decisional conflict .

Methods / Design This is a protocol for a multicenter practical patient-level r and omized trial to compare an intervention group receiving a decision aid , Chest Pain Choice ( CPC ) , to a control group receiving usual care .  Adults presenting to five geographically and ethnically diverse EDs who are being considered for admission for observation and advanced cardiac testing will be eligible for enrollment . We will measure the effect of CPC on ( 1 ) patient knowledge regarding their 45-day risk for ACS and the available management options ( primary outcome ) ; ( 2 ) patient engagement in the decision-making process ; ( 3 ) the degree of conflict patients experience related to feeling uninformed ( decisional conflict ) ; ( 4 ) patient and clinician satisfaction with the decision made ; ( 5 ) the rate of major adverse cardiac events at 30 days ; ( 6 ) the proportion of patients admitted for advanced cardiac testing ; and ( 7 ) healthcare utilization . To assess these outcomes , we will administer patient and clinician surveys immediately after each clinical encounter , obtain video recordings of the patient-clinician discussion , administer a patient healthcare utilization diary , analyze hospital billing records , review the electronic medical record , and conduct telephone follow-up .

The Personal Patient Profile-Prostate ( P3P ) is a computerized decision aid for men with LPC that focuses on personal preferences . We determined whether the P3P intervention improved the concordance of treatment choice with self-reported influential side-effects compared with a control group . Methods English/Spanish-speaking men diagnosed with LPC ( 2007–2009 ) from four US cities were enrolled into a r and omized trial and followed through 6-months via mailed or online question naire . Men were r and omized to receive the P3P intervention or st and ard education plus links to reputable websites . We classified choice as concordant if men were concerned with ( a ) sexual function and chose external beam radiotherapy or brachytherapy , ( b ) bowel function and chose prostatectomy , ( c ) sex , bowel , and /or bladder function and chose active surveillance , or ( d ) not concerned with any side effect and chose any treatment . Using logistic regression , we calculated odds ratios ( OR ) and 95 % confidence intervals ( CI ) for the association between the P3P intervention and concordance . Results Of 448 men , most were < 65 years , non-Hispanic white , had multiple physician consultations prior to enrollment , and chose a treatment discordant with concerns about potential side effects . There was no significant difference in concordance between the intervention ( 45 % ) and control ( 50 % ) group ( OR = 0.82 ; 95%CI = 0.56 , 1.2 ) . Conclusions The P3P intervention did not improve concordance between potential side effects and treatment choice . Information and /or physician consultation immediately after diagnosis was likely to influence decisions despite concerns about side effects . The intervention may be more effective before the first treatment options consultation .

METHODS Four hundred and seventeen people aged 40 - 69 years ( sex : F 53%/M 47 % ) , without known diabetes , recruited from street locations . Participants were r and omised to receive one of two hypothetical invitations for screening for type 2 diabetes ; one based on General Medical Council guidelines and combined with a decisional balance sheet , the other a brief traditional invitation .  Informed choice was assessed immediately after the invitation and 3 weeks later using measures of knowledge , attitudes and intentions . RESULTS Two weeks after receipt of the invitation , the proportion of informed choices was significantly higher among participants who received the informed choice invitation compared with those who received the traditional invitation ( 42.9 % versus 11.2 % ; difference=31.7 % , 95 % CI : 22.5 - 40.5 % ; p<0.001 ) . Mean knowledge scores were significantly higher after the receipt of the invitation design ed to facilitate informed choices than after the traditional invitation ( 5.49 versus 3.90 ; t(405)=10.106 , p<0.001 ) . Intentions to participate in screening were unaffected by receipt of the informed choice invitation . CONCLUSION Compared with a traditional invitation , receipt of the invitation design ed to facilitate informed choices increased the proportion of informed choices about type 2 diabetes screening attendance .

However , non-disclosure precludes the ability to request ' reasonable adjustments ' . There have been no intervention studies to support decision-making about disclosure to an employer . AIMS To determine whether the decision aid has an effect that is sustained beyond its immediate impact ; to determine whether a large-scale trial is feasible ; and to optimise the design s of a larger trial and of the decision aid . METHOD In this exploratory r and omised controlled trial ( RCT ) in London , participants were r and omly assigned to use of a decision aid plus usual care or usual care alone . Follow-up was at 3 months . Primary outcomes were : ( a ) stage of decision-making ; ( b ) decisional conflict ; and ( c ) employment-related outcomes ( trial registration number : NCT01379014 ) . RESULTS We recruited 80 participants and interventions were completed for 36 out of 40 in the intervention group ; in total 71 participants were followed up . Intention-to-treat analysis showed that reduction in decisional conflict was significantly greater in the intervention group than among controls ( mean improvement -22.7 ( s.d . = 15.2 ) v. -11.2 ( s.d . = 18.1 ) , P = 0.005 ) .

Self-testing does have advantages as well as disadvantages , and the debate on whether self-testing should be encouraged or rather discouraged is still ongoing . One of the concerns is whether consumers have sufficient knowledge to perform the test and interpret the results . An online decision aid ( DA ) with information on self-testing in general , and test specific information on cholesterol and diabetes self-testing was developed . The DA aims to provide objective information on these self-tests as well as a decision support tool to weigh the pros and cons of self-testing . The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of the online decision aid  on knowledge on self-testing , informed choice , ambivalence and psychosocial determinants . Methods / Design A single blind r and omised controlled trial in which the online decision aid ' zelftestwijzer ' is compared to short , non-interactive information on self-testing in general . The entire trial will be conducted online . Participants will be selected from an existing Internet panel . Consumers who are considering doing a cholesterol or diabetes self-test in the future will be included . Outcome measures will be assessed directly after participants have viewed either the DA or the control condition . Weblog files will be used to record participants ' use of the decision aid . Discussion Self-testing does have important pros and cons , and it is important that consumers base their decision whether they want to do a self-test or not on knowledge and personal values . This study is the first to evaluate the effect of an online decision aid  for self-testing . Trial registration Dutch Trial Register :\", 'Colorectal cancer screening works ! We have convincing evidence from r and omized trials of fecal occult blood tests ( FOBT ) showing that colorectal cancer screening reduces disease-specific morbidity and mortality1 . Case-control studies suggest that endoscopy is also effective2–4 . Nonetheless , only about 60 % of eligible adults are currently screened for colorectal cancer5 . In contrast , nearly 75 % of women are currently screened for breast cancer6 , which has a similar level of evidence for efficacy as colorectal screening . More than 70 % of men are currently screened for prostate cancer , which has uncertain efficacy7 . The discordance between evidence and uptake of colorectal cancer screening has sparked considerable efforts to increase screening rates . However , the report by Kahi and colleagues suggests that these efforts may have the unintended consequence of promoting screening recommendations that fail to adequately consider the risks and benefits of screening in the context of a patient′s health status and life expectancy8 . Perhaps cancer screening is like the forward pass in football . Darrell Royal the legendary coach at the University of Texas has said , “ When you throw a pass , only three things can happen , and two of ‘ em are bad . ” Colorectal cancer screening can reduce morbidity and mortality , the supreme accomplishment of a screening program . However , the absolute benefit to a screened population is small ; most people will not benefit because they do not have early-stage colorectal cancer or polyps destined to become malignant . The Minnesota Colon Cancer Control Study showed that annual FOBT screening  reduced colorectal cancer mortality by about 3 deaths per 1000 people screened after 13 years of follow up9 . Similarly , screening  reduced the risk for cancer diagnosis by just 7 per 1,000 people screened after 18 years of follow up10 . This small likelihood of future benefit must then be weighed against the more immediate potential downsides of screening , including false positive tests , the costs and risks of invasive diagnostic tests , treatment complications , and the risk for overdiagnosing cancer — finding disease that is not destined to cause any problems during a patient′s lifetime . The latter problem is particularly pertinent for cancer screening in sick and elderly patients . To minimize inappropriate and potentially harmful screening , the US Preventive Services Task Force has recently provided explicit guidelines —no screening after age 85 and personalized screening decisions for those ages 76 to 8511 . These recommendations are partly based on the trial data showing that colorectal cancer survival curves did not diverge until 5 years after the start of screening . This interval reflects that it often takes many years between when a cancer could be first detectable by screening until when it would have grown large enough to cause symptoms or death . The recommendation for “ personalized ” screening decisions really is a call for informed decision making . Older patients , especially those who have serious medical illnesses , need to be aware that they are least likely to live long enough to receive any benefit from cancer screening and more likely to experience the complications from tests and treatments . The study by Kahi and colleagues did not address whether physicians would elicit patient preferences or support informed decision-making , but the fact that respondents reported that they would offer screening to patients over age 85 or to 75-year-old patients with cancers or severe heart failure is disconcerting . These patients clearly are very unlikely to derive any benefit from screening and are at substantial risk for being harmed . While these are survey data and respondents were presented with hypothetical scenarios , it appears that actual screening practice s may indeed be quite inappropriate . A recent cohort study of older veterans at four VA medical centers used linked VA and Medicare data to describe screening practice s12 . During calendar years 2001 and 2002 , 37.6 % of veterans aged 80 and older who were due for colorectal cancer screening underwent screening with FOBT , endoscopy , or barium enema . Strikingly , among this group , the screening rate was 34 % for those with severe comorbidity ( defined by Charlson – Deyo scores ≥ 4 ) , only slightly lower than the 38 % screening rate for those who had comorbidity scores of 0 . Why is this happening ? Several authors have suggested that organizational zeal to boost screening rates by converting practice guidelines into performance measures can increase the rate of inappropriate screening in the sick and elderly13,14 . Similarly , public service messages targeting the public may oversimplify the screening message—“just do it”—rather than presenting accurate , balanced information about the pros and cons of screening . Such oversimplified messages likely contribute to why many patients do not make informed decisions about cancer screening and why frail elderly patients continue to undergo cancer screening , even when the risks are substantial and the benefits are remote . What can be done about this ? Clearly , organizations need to more carefully balance performance measures and financial incentives with evidence -based guidelines . Quality -of-care assessment s must identify and reward efforts that target patients most likely to benefit from screening rather than those efforts that merely increase screening rates . Optimizing the targeting of cancer screening also may require changes in how preventive care is delivered . The current system for delivering preventive care relies on finding opportunities for screening when patients see clinicians for medical problems , which targets screening to elderly patients with more serious comorbid conditions because they see clinicians more frequently . This system misses healthy patients who see clinicians less frequently . In addition , both patients and clinicians need to be more aware of the potential risks associated with screening , especially for persons with advanced age and serious comorbidities . When two out of three outcomes for the forward pass are bad , the coach and players need to carefully study the playbook and make an informed decision', 'Objective To assess which of three triage strategies for women with borderline abnormal cervical smear results in the best psychosocial outcomes . Design Pragmatic , non-blinded , multicentre , r and omised controlled trial . Setting 18 family planning clinics across Australia , covering both urban and rural areas , between January 2004 and October 2006 . Participants Women aged 16 - 70 years ( n=314 ) who attended routine cervical screening and received a borderline cervical smear . Interventions Patients were r and omly assigned to human papillomavirus ( HPV ) DNA testing ( n=104 ) , a repeat smear test at six months ( n=106 ) , or the patient ’s informed choice of either test supported by a decision aid ( n=104 ) . Psychosocial outcomes were assessed at multiple time points over 12 months by postal question naire . Main outcome measures We assessed health related quality of life ( SF36 mental health subscale ) , cognitive effects ( such as perceived risk of cervical cancer , intrusive thoughts ) , affective outcomes ( general anxiety [ state-trait anxiety inventory ] ) , specific anxiety about an abnormal smear ( cervical screening question naire ) , and behavioural outcomes ( sexual health behaviour and visits to the doctor ) over 12 months of follow-up . Results At two weeks , some psychosocial outcomes were worse for women allocated to HPV testing compared with those in the smear testing group ( SF36 vitality subscale : t=−1.63 , df=131 , P=0.10 ; intrusive thoughts χ2=8.14 , df=1 , P<0.01 ) . Over 12 months , distress about the abnormal smear was lowest in women allocated to HPV testing and highest in the repeat smear testing group ( t=−2.89 , df=135 , P<0.01 ) . Intrusive thoughts were highest in patients allocated to HPV testing ( 25 % , compared with 13 % in the informed choice group ; difference=12 % , 95 % CI −1.1 % to 25.1 % ) . Women in the HPV DNA group and the informed choice group were more satisfied with their care than women allocated to repeat smear testing . Conclusions Although the psychosocial effect was initially worse for women allocated to HPV triage , over the full year of follow-up this intervention was better for women ’s psychosocial health than repeat smear testing . Offering informed choice could have a small advantage for cognitive outcomes , but in view of the additional effort and logistical complexity that this intervention requires , HPV testing alone can be justified for most women . Trial Registration actr.org.au Identifier :', 'OBJECTIVE To test whether information about benefits and harms of screening for type 2 diabetes increases intentions to make lifestyle changes amongst attenders , predominantly among the socially advantaged and those with a strong future time orientation . STUDY DESIGN Planned subgroup analysis of attenders for screening participating in a r and omized controlled trial of an informed choice invitation vs a st and ard invitation to attend for type 2 diabetes screening . METHODS Potentially eligible participants were identified from practice registers using routine data which were used to calculate risk scores for diabetes for all aged 40 - 69 years without known type 2 diabetes and area deprivation based on post code . In total , 1272 individuals in the top 25 % risk category were r and omized to receive one of two  invitations to attend their practice s for screening : an informed choice invitation or a st and ard invitation . The subsequent attenders completed self-report measures of future time orientation and deprivation immediately before undergoing a screening test . RESULTS Individual-level deprivation demonstrated a significant moderator effect [ F ( 4,635 ) = 4.32 , P = 0.002 ] : individuals who were high in deprivation had lower intentions to engage in lifestyle change following receipt of the informed choice invitation . However , intentions were not patterned by deprivation when it was assessed at the area-level using the Index of Multiple Deprivation 2007 . The hypothesized moderating effect of future time orientation on invitation type was also supported [ F(14,613 ) = 2.46 , P = 0.002 ) : individuals low in future time orientation had markedly lower intentions to engage in lifestyle change following receipt of an informed choice invitation compared with a st and ard invitation for screening . CONCLUSION Efforts to enhance informed choice where the implication s of diagnosis are a requirement for lifestyle change may require that the immediate benefits are communicated , and efforts to address the apparent barriers to diabetes self-care are made , if the potential for inequity is to be avoided', 'The concept of shared decision making ( SDM ) is an important emerging trend in clinical medicine but has received little or no attention in the dental literature . Decision aids can play a useful role in SDM by helping patients and clinicians choose among reasonable alternative treatment options . The purpose of this study was to develop and test an Endodontic Decision Board ( EndoDB ) for chairside use to help clarify treatment alternatives , benefits , risks , prognosis , and costs when root canal therapy or extraction of a tooth was indicated . The hypothesis was that the use of the EndoDB would lead to improved patient knowledge , greater satisfaction with the decision-making process , and no difference in anxiety when compared to the st and ard discussion and informed consent process ( usual care ) . The EndoDB was tested in a r and omized controlled trial in a postgraduate endodontics clinic . After treatment discussion , a brief question naire was completed by the patient to measure knowledge , satisfaction , and anxiety .  Patients in the EndoDB group ( n=32 ) demonstrated a small , but statistically significant , increase in knowledge ( t-test ; difference=+0.37 ; p=0.03 ) compared to the  usual care group ( n=35 ) . There was no difference between groups in the measures of satisfaction or anxiety ( Mann-Whitney U-test ; p>0.05 ) . Decision aids may emerge as a useful tool to facilitate SDM and evidence -based clinical practice', 'Background No more than 10 - 15 % of type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) patients achieve all treatment goals regarding glycaemic control , lipids and blood pressure . Shared decision making ( SDM ) should increase that percentage ; however , not all support decision tools are appropriate . Because the ADDITION-Europe study demonstrated two ( almost ) equally effective treatments but with slightly different intensities , it may be a good starting point to discuss with the patients their diabetes treatment , taking into account both the intensity of treatment , clinical factors and patients ’ preferences . We aim to evaluate whether such an approach increases the proportion of patients that achieve all three treatment goals . Methods In a cluster-r and omised trial including 40 general practice s , that participated until 2009 in the ADDITION Study , 150 T2DM patients 60–80 years , known with T2DM for 8 - 15 years , will be included . Practice s are r and omised a second time , i.e. intervention practice s in the ADDITION study could be control practice s in the current study and vice versa . For the GPs from the intervention group a 2-hour training in SDM was developed as well as a decision support tool to be used during the consultation . GPs plan the first visit with the patients to decide on the intensity of the treatment , personalised targets and the priorities of treatment . The control group will continue with the treatment they were allocated to in the ADDITION study . Follow-up : 24 months . The primary outcome is the proportion of patients who achieve all three treatment goals . Secondary outcomes are the proportion of patients who achieve five treatment goals ( HbA1c , blood pressure , total cholesterol , body weight , not smoking ) , evaluation of the SDM process ( SDM-Q9 and CPS ) , satisfaction with the treatment ( DTSQ ) , wellbeing and quality of life ( W-BQ12 , ADD QoL-19 ) , health status ( SF-36 , EQ-5D ) and coping ( DCMQ ) . The proportions of achieved treatment goals will be compared between both groups . For the secondary outcomes mixed models will be used . The Medical Research Ethics Committee of the University Medical Centre Utrecht has approved the study protocol ( Protocol number : 11 - 153 ) . Discussion This trial will provide evidence whether an intervention with a multi-faceted decision support tool increases the proportion of achieved personalised goals in type 2 diabetes patients .Trial registration NCT02285881 , November 4 ,', 'In patients with early stage papillary thyroid carcinoma ( PTC ) who have had a thyroidectomy , the decision must be made to accept or reject radioactive iodine remnant ablation ( RRA ) . Counselling patients about this decision can be challenging , given the medical evidence uncertainties and the complexity of related information . Although physicians are the primary source of medical information for patients considering RRA , some patients have a desire for supplemental information from sources such as the internet . Yet , thyroid cancer re sources on the internet are of variable quality , and some may not be applicable to the individual case . We have developed a computerized educational tool [ called a decision aid ( DA ) ] , directed to patients with early stage papillary thyroid cancer , and intended as an adjunct to physician counselling , to relay evidence ‐based medical information on disease prognosis and the choice to accept or reject RRA . DAs are tools used to inform patients about available treatment options and have been utilized in oncologic decision‐making . We tested our web‐based DA in fifty patients with early stage PTC and found that it improved medical knowledge . Furthermore , participants found the technical usability of the tool acceptable . We are currently conducting a r and omized controlled trial comparing the use of the DA plus usual care to usual care alone to confirm the educational benefit of the website and examine its impact on the decision‐making process . In the future , DAs may play an exp and ed role as an adjunct to physician counselling in the care of patients with thyroid cancer', 'Background Prostate cancer is the most common cancer affecting men in the United States . Management options for localized disease exist , yet an evidence -based criterion st and ard for treatment still has to emerge . Although 5-year survival rates approach 98 % , all treatment options carry the possibility for significant side effects , such as erectile dysfunction and urinary incontinence . It is therefore recommended that patients be actively involved in the treatment decision process . We have developed an Internet/CD-ROM-based multimedia Prostate Interactive Educational System ( PIES ) to enhance patients ’ treatment decision making . PIES virtually mirrors a health center to provide patients with information about prostate cancer and its treatment through an intuitive interface , using videos , animations , graphics , and texts . Objectives ( 1 ) To examine the acceptability and feasibility of the PIES intervention and to report preliminary outcomes of the program in a pilot trial among patients with a new prostate cancer diagnosis , and ( 2 ) to explore the potential impact of tailoring PIES treatment information to participants ’ information-seeking styles on study outcomes . Methods Participants ( n = 72 ) were patients with newly diagnosed localized prostate cancer who had not made a treatment decision . Patients were r and omly assigned to 3 experimental conditions : ( 1 ) control condition ( providing information through st and ard National Cancer Institute brochures ; 26 % ) , and PIES ( 2 ) with tailoring ( 43 % ) and ( 3 ) without tailoring to a patient ’s information-seeking style ( 31 % ) . Question naires were administrated before ( t1 ) and immediately after the intervention ( t2 ) . Measurements include evaluation and acceptability of the PIES intervention , monitoring/blunting information-seeking style , psychological distress , and decision-related variables ( eg , decisional confidence , feeling informed about prostate cancer and treatment , and treatment preference ) . Results The PIES program was well accepted by patients and did not interfere with the clinical routine . About 79 % of eligible patients ( 72/91 ) completed the pre- and post-PIES intervention assessment s. Patients in the PIES groups compared with those in the control condition were significantly more likely to report higher levels of confidence in their treatment choices , higher levels of helpfulness of the information they received in making a treatment decision , and that the information they received was emotionally reassuring . Patients in the PIES groups compared with those in the control condition were significantly less likely to need more information about treatment options , were less anxious about their treatment choices , and thought the information they received was clear ( P < .05 ) . Tailoring PIES information to information-seeking style was not related to decision-making variables . Conclusions This pilot study confirms that the implementation of PIES within a clinical practice is feasible and acceptable to patients with a recent diagnosis of prostate cancer . PIES improved key decision-making process variables and reduced the emotional impact of a difficult medical decision', 'BACKGROUND The \" Just-in-time Information \" ( JIT ) librarian consultation service was design ed to provide rapid information to answer primary care clinical questions during patient hours . This study evaluated whether information provided by librarians to answer clinical questions positively impacted time , decision-making , cost savings and satisfaction . METHODS AND FINDING A r and omized controlled trial ( RCT ) was conducted between October 2005 and April 2006 . A total of 1,889 questions were sent to the service by 88 participants . The object of the r and omization was a clinical question . Each participant had clinical questions r and omly allocated to both intervention ( librarian information ) and control ( no librarian information ) groups . Participants were trained to send clinical questions via a h and -held device . The impact of the information provided by the service ( or not provided by the service ) , additional re sources and time required for both groups was assessed using a survey sent 24 hours after a question was su bmi tted . The average time for JIT librarians to respond to all questions was 13.68 minutes/ question ( 95 % CI , 13.38 to 13.98 ) . The average time for participants to respond their control questions was 20.29 minutes/ question ( 95 % CI , 18.72 to 21.86 ) . Using an impact assessment scale rating cognitive impact , participants rated 62.9 % of information provided to intervention group questions as having a highly positive cognitive impact . They rated 14.8 % of their own answers to control question as having a highly positive cognitive impact , 44.9 % has having a negative cognitive impact , and 24.8 % with no cognitive impact at all . In an exit survey measuring satisfaction , 86 % ( 62/72 responses ) of participants scored the service as having a positive impact on care and 72 % ( 52/72 ) indicated that they would use the service frequently if it were continued . CONCLUSIONS In this study , providing timely information to clinical questions had a highly positive impact on decision-making and a high approval rating from participants . Using a librarian to respond to clinical questions may allow primary care professionals to have more time in their day , thus potentially increasing patient access to care . Such services may reduce costs through decreasing the need for referrals , further tests , and other courses of action . TRIAL REGISTRATION Controlled-Trials.com IS RCT N96823810', 'Objective : To evaluate a decision aid ( DA ) design ed to promote informed decision making for prostate cancer screening . Methods : Twelve work sites were r and omly assigned to an intervention or nonintervention comparison condition . Intervention sites received access to a computer-tailored DA at the workplace . Male employees age 45 years and above ( n = 625 ) completed surveys at baseline and at 3-month follow-up , documenting aspects of informed decision making . Results : Using an intention-to-treat analysis , men in the intervention group were significantly more likely to have made a screening decision and to have improved knowledge without increased decisional conflict , relative to men in the comparison group . These changes were observed despite the fact that only 30 % of men in intervention sites used the DA . Among DA users , similar improvements were observed , although the magnitudes of changes were substantially greater , and significant improvements in decision self-efficacy were observed . Conclusions : A DA offered in the workplace promoted decision making , improved knowledge , and increased decision self-efficacy among users , without increasing decisional conflict . However , participation was suboptimal , suggesting that better methods for engaging men in workplace interventions are needed . Impact Statement : This trial shows the efficacy of a computer-tailored DA in promoting informed decisions about prostate cancer screening . The DA was delivered through work sites , thereby providing access to re sources required to participate in informed decision making without requiring a medical appointment . However , participation rates were suboptimal , and additional strategies for engaging men are needed .

OBJECTIVE To determine whether use of an audiobooklet ( AB ) decision aid explaining the results of a clinical trial affected the decision-making process of study participants . DESIGN R and omized controlled trial conducted from May 1997 to April 1998 . SETTING Fourteen centers that participated in the Stroke Prevention in Atrial Fibrillation ( SPAF ) III trial . PARTICIPANTS A total of 287 patients from the SPAF III aspirin cohort study , in which patients with atrial fibrillation and a relatively low risk of stroke received 325 mg/d of aspirin and were followed up for a mean of 2 years . INTERVENTION At the end of SPAF III , participants were r and omized to be informed of the study results with usual care plus use of an AB ( AB group ) vs usual care alone ( control group ) . The AB included pertinent information to help patients decide whether to continue taking aspirin or switch to warfarin . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Patients ' ability to make choices regarding antithrombotic therapy , and 6-month adherence to these decisions . Their knowledge , expectations , decisional conflict ( the amount of uncertainty about the course of action to take ) , and satisfaction with the decision-making process were also measured . RESULTS More patients in the AB group made a choice about antithrombotic therapy than in the control group ( 99 % vs 94 % ; P = .02 ) . Patients in the AB group were more knowledgeable and had more realistic expectations about the risk of stroke and hemorrhage ( in the AB group , 53%-80 % correctly estimated different risks ; in the control group , 16%-28 % gave correct estimates ) . Decisional conflict and satisfaction were similar for the 2 groups . After 6 months , a similar percentage of patients were still taking their initial choice of antithrombotic therapy ( 95 % vs 93 % ; P = .44 ) . CONCLUSIONS For patients with atrial fibrillation who had participated in a major clinical trial , the use of an AB decision aid improved their underst and ing of the benefits and risks associated with different treatment options and helped them make definitive choices about which therapy to take . Further studies are necessary to evaluate the acceptability and impact of decision aids in other clinical setting\", \"BACKGROUND An Internet safety decision aid was developed to help abused women underst and their risk for repeat and near-lethal intimate partner violence , clarify priorities related to safety , and develop an action plan customized to these priorities . PURPOSE To test the effectiveness of a safety decision aid compared with usual safety planning ( control ) delivered through a secure website , using a multistate RCT design . The paper evaluates the effectiveness of the safety decision aid in reducing decisional conflict after a single use by abused women . DESIGN RCT referred to as Internet Re source for Intervention and Safety ( IRIS ) . SETTING / PARTICIPANTS Abused women who spoke English ( n=708 ) were enrolled in a four-state RCT . INTERVENTION The intervention was an interactive safety decision aid with personalized safety plan ; the control condition was usual safety planning re sources . Both were delivered to participants through the secure study website . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES This paper compares women 's decisional conflict about safety : total decisional conflict and the four subscales of this measure ( feeling : uninformed , uncertain , unsupported , and unclear about safety priorities ) between intervention/control conditions . Data were collected from March 2011 to May 2013 and analyzed from January to March 2014 . RESULTS Immediately following the first use of the interactive safety decision aid , intervention women had significantly lower total decisional conflict than control women , controlling for baseline value of decisional conflict ( p=0.002 , effect size=0.12 ) . After controlling for baseline values , the safety decision aid group had significantly greater reduction in feeling uncertain ( p=0.006 , effect size=0.07 ) and in feeling unsupported ( p=0.008 , effect size=0.07 ) about safety than the usual safety planning group . CONCLUSIONS Abused women r and omized to the safety decision aid reported less decisional conflict about their safety in the abusive intimate relationship after one use compared to women r and omized to the usual safety planning condition\", 'AIMS Chronic benzodiazepine use is highly prevalent and is associated with a variety of negative health consequences . The present study examined the long-term effectiveness of a  tailored patient education intervention on benzodiazepine use . DESIGN A r and omized controlled trial was conducted comprising three arms , comparing ( i ) a single tailored intervention ; ( ii ) a multiple tailored intervention and ( iii ) a general practitioner letter . The post-test took place after 12 months . PARTICIPANTS Five hundred and eight patients using benzodiazepines were recruited by their general practitioners and assigned r and omly to one of the three groups . INTERVENTION Two tailored interventions , the single tailored intervention ( patients received one tailored letter ) and the multiple tailored intervention ( patients received three sequential tailored letters at intervals of 1 month ) , were compared to a short general practitioner letter that modelled usual care . The tailored interventions not only provided different and more information than the general practitioner letter ; they were also personalized and adapted to individual baseline characteristics . The information in both tailored interventions was the same , but in the multiple tailored intervention the information was provided to the participants spread over three occasions . In the multiple tailored intervention , the second and the third tailored letters were based on short and st and ardized telephone interviews . MEASUREMENTS Benzodiazepine cessation at post-test was the outcome measure . FINDINGS The results showed that participants receiving the tailored interventions were twice as likely to have quit benzodiazepine use compared to the general practitioner letter . Particularly among participants with the intention to discontinue usage at baseline , both tailored interventions led to high percentages of those who actually discontinued usage ( single tailored intervention 51.7 % ; multiple tailored intervention 35.6 % ; general practitioner letter 14.5 % ) . CONCLUSIONS It was concluded that tailored patient education can be an effective tool for reducing benzodiazepine use , and can be implemented easily', 'Purpose Evaluate baseline factors that may explain the influence of study site on decisional conflict ( DC ) in men from the Personal Patient Profile : Prostate ( P3P ) r and omized trial . Material s and methods 476 cases from 5 P3P sites were included . Participants completed baseline demographic assessment s , 4 subscales of the DC scale at baseline ( uncertainty , informed , values clarity , and support ) , the Exp and ed Prostate Cancer Index Composite ( short form ) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory . Site data regarding typical practice s were collected . Linear regressions were used to model the relation between baseline DC scores and study site adjusting for the list of variables . Results Baseline decisional uncertainly ( p?=?0.001 ) and informed ( p?=?0.03 ) subscales were significantly different across sites . Participant demographic and baseline measures were significantly different ( p?<?0.05 ) between sites except for trait anxiety . We identified participant level factors that explained study site differences at baseline for the decisional uncertainty and values clarity subscales : a preferred treatment choice at study entry , whether the study program was accessed at home vs. in clinic , number of doctors consulted pre- study , working status , state anxiety , information from the media or a health care provider , and perceived knowledge level . State anxiety was associated with higher DC across all subscales . Conclusions Individual characteristics of men seeking consultation for LPC were associated with DC at baseline , not the site alone ; anxiety contributed to higher conflict . These findings will inform future development and implementation of the P3P and other decision support interventions .Trial registration NCT00692653', 'Background Competing health concerns present real obstacles to people living with diabetes and other chronic diseases as well as to their primary care providers . Guideline implementation interventions rarely acknowledge this , leaving both patients and providers feeling overwhelmed by the volume of recommended actions . Interprofessional ( IP ) shared decision-making ( SDM ) with the use of decision aids may help to set treatment priorities . We developed an evidence -based SDM intervention for patients with diabetes and other conditions that was framed by the IP-SDM model and followed a user-centered approach . Our objective in the present study is to pilot an IP-SDM and goal - setting toolkit following the Knowledge-to-Action Framework to assess ( 1 ) intervention fidelity and the feasibility of conducting a larger trial and ( 2 ) impact on decisional conflict , diabetes distress , health-related quality of life and patient assessment of chronic illness care . Methods / Design A two-step , parallel-group , clustered r and omized controlled trial ( RCT ) will be conducted , with the primary goal being to assess intervention fidelity and the feasibility of conducting a larger RCT . The first step is a provider-directed implementation only ; the second ( after a 6-month delay ) involves both provider- and patient-directed implementation . Half of the clusters will be assigned to receive the IP-SDM toolkit , and the other will be assigned to be mailed a diabetes guidelines summary . Individual interviews with patients , their family members and health care providers will be conducted upon trial completion to explore toolkit use . A secondary purpose of this trial is to gather estimates of the toolkit ’s impact on decisional conflict . Secondary outcomes include diabetes distress , quality of life and chronic illness care , which will be assessed on the basis of patient-completed question naires of vali date d scales at baseline and at 6 and 12 months . Multilevel hierarchical regression models will be used to account for the clustered nature of the data . Discussion An individualized approach to patients with multiple chronic conditions using SDM and goal setting is a desirable strategy for achieving guideline -concordant treatment in a patient-centered fashion . Our pilot trial will provide insights regarding strategies for the routine implementation of such interventions in clinical practice , and it will offer an assessment of the impact of this approach .

In this project , we examine the role of an e-health-assisted consumer-focused strategy as a means of overcoming these gaps between evidence and practice . Consumer Navigation of Electronic Cardiovascular Tools ( CONNECT ) aims to test whether a consumer-focused e-health strategy provided to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Isl and er and non-indigenous adults , recruited through primary care , at moderate-to-high risk of a cardiovascular disease event will improve risk factor control when compared with usual care . Methods and analysis R and omised controlled trial of 2000 participants with an average of 18 months of follow-up to evaluate the effectiveness of an integrated consumer-directed e-health portal on cardiovascular risk compared with usual care in patients with cardiovascular disease or who are at moderate-to-high cardiovascular disease risk . The trial will be augmented by formal economic and process evaluations to assess acceptability , equity and cost-effectiveness of the intervention . The intervention group will participate in a consumer-directed e-health strategy for cardiovascular risk management . The programme is electronically integrated with the primary care provider 's software and will include interactive smart phone and Internet platforms . The primary outcome is a composite endpoint of the proportion of people meeting the Australian guideline -recommended blood pressure ( BP ) and cholesterol targets . Secondary outcomes include change in mean BP and fasting cholesterol levels , proportion meeting BP and cholesterol targets separately , self-efficacy , health literacy , self-reported point prevalence abstinence in smoking , body mass index and waist circumference , self-reported physical activity and self-reported medication adherence .

Assessment s were conducted during the decision aid visit ; telephone follow-up interviews were conducted when patients made their decisions with their physician , 3 months after completing treatment , and > 1 year later ( per a mailing ) . Outcome measures included the Decisional Conflict Scale , the Preparation for Decision Making Scale , and the Decision Regret Scale . Results A total of 156 patients participated , 75 provided information only and 81 provided information plus values clarification exercises . The groups did not differ significantly on any outcome evaluated at the decision aid visit ; in both groups , decisional conflict decreased immediately after using the decision aid . Between-group differences emerged after the decision was actually made . The values clarification exercises group reported higher Preparation for Decision Making Scale scores at the decision follow-up and at the > 1-year follow-up . Regret did not differ significantly between groups at the 3-month follow-up but was lower for the values clarification exercises group than for the information group at the > 1-year follow-up . Conclusion The results suggest that the values clarification exercises led to better preparation for decision making and to less regret . The impact , however , only emerged after the decision was made', \"OBJECTIVES Involvement of community mental health consumers in mental health decision making has been consistently associated with improvements in health outcomes . Electronic decision support systems ( EDSSs ) that support both consumer and provider decision making may be a sustainable way to improve dyadic communication in a field with approximately 50 % workforce turnover per year . This study examined the feasibility of such a system and investigated proximal outcomes of the system 's performance . METHODS A cluster r and omized design was used to evaluate an EDSS at three urban community mental health sites . Case managers ( N=20 ) were r and omly assigned to the EDSS-supported planning group or to the usual care planning group .  Consumers ( N=80 ) were assigned to the same group as their case managers . User satisfaction with the care planning process was assessed for consumers and case managers ( possible scores range from 1 to 5 , with higher summary scores indicating more satisfaction ) . Recall of the care plan was assessed for consumers . Linear regression with adjustment for grouping by worker was used to assess satisfaction scores . A Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to examine knowledge of the care plan . RESULTS Compared with case managers in the control group , those in the intervention group were significantly more satisfied with the care planning process ( mean ± SD score=4.0 ± .5 versus 3.3 ± .5 ; adjusted p=.01 ) . Compared with consumers in the control group , those in the intervention group had significantly greater recall of their care plans three days after the planning session ( mean proportion of plan goals recalled=75 % ± 28 % versus 57 % ± 32 % ; p=.02 ) . There were no differences between the clients in the intervention and control groups regarding satisfaction . CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrated that clients can build their own care plans and negotiate and revise them with their case managers using an EDSS\", \"Background Much of the research on decision-making in health care has focused on consultation outcomes . Less is known about the process by which clinicians and patients come to a treatment decision . This study aim ed to quantitatively describe the behaviour shown by doctors and patients during primary care consultations when three types of decision aids were used to promote treatment decision-making in a r and omised controlled trial . Methods A video-based study set in an efficacy trial which compared the use of paper-based guidelines ( control ) with two forms of computer-based decision aids ( implicit and explicit versions of DARTS II ) . Treatment decision concerned warfarin anti-coagulation to reduce the risk of stroke in older patients with atrial fibrillation . Twenty nine consultations were video-recorded .  A ten-minute ' slice ' of the consultation was sample d for detailed content analysis using existing interaction analysis protocol s for verbal behaviour and ethological techniques for non-verbal behaviour . Results Median consultation times ( quartiles ) differed significantly depending on the technology used . Paper-based guidelines took 21 ( 19–26 ) minutes to work through compared to 31 ( 16–41 ) minutes for the implicit tool ; and 44 ( 39–55 ) minutes for the explicit tool . In the ten minutes immediately preceding the decision point , GPs dominated the conversation , accounting for 64 % ( 58–66 % ) of all utterances and this trend was similar across all three arms of the trial . Information-giving was the most frequent activity for both GPs and patients , although GPs did this at twice the rate compared to patients and at higher rates in consultations involving computerised decision aids . GPs ' language was highly technically focused and just 7 % of their conversation was socio-emotional in content ; this was half the socio-emotional content shown by patients ( 15 % ) . However , frequent head nodding and a close mirroring in the direction of eye-gaze suggested that both parties were active participants in the conversation Conclusion Irrespective of the arm of the trial , both patients ' and GPs ' behaviour showed that they were reciprocally engaged in these consultations . However , even in consultations aim ed at promoting shared decision-making , GPs ' were verbally dominant , and they worked primarily as information providers for patients . In addition , computer-based decision aids significantly prolonged the consultations , particularly the later phases . These data suggest that decision aids may not lead to more ' sharing ' in treatment decision-making and that , in their current form , they may take too long to negotiate for use in routine primary care\", 'Abstract Research on mobile health decision support systems ( mHealth DSS ) is limited , and few studies have focused on nurses or nurse practitioners ( NPs ) . This study compared diagnostic rates and care planning by nurses in NP training r and omized to mHealth DSS versus a control group for obesity and overweight , tobacco use , and depression . The patient encounter ( N = 34,349 ) was the unit of analysis in the r and omized controlled trial . NP students were assigned within specialty to receive mHealth DSS for 1 of 3 conditions . There was a significant effect (', \"OBJECTIVES To test whether a decision aid improves quality of decision-making about feeding options in advanced dementia . DESIGN Cluster r and omized controlled trial . SETTING Twenty-four nursing homes in North Carolina . PARTICIPANTS Residents with advanced dementia and feeding problems and their surrogates . INTERVENTION Intervention surrogates received an audio or print decision aid on feeding options in advanced dementia . Controls received usual care . MEASUREMENTS Primary outcome was the Decisional Conflict Scale ( range : 1 - 5 ) measured at 3 months ; other main outcomes were surrogate knowledge , frequency of communication with providers , and feeding treatment use . RESULTS Two hundred fifty-six residents and surrogate decision-makers were recruited . Residents ' average age was 85 ; 67 % were Caucasian , and 79 % were women . Surrogates ' average age was 59 ; 67 % were Caucasian , and 70 % were residents ' children . The intervention improved knowledge scores ( 16.8 vs 15.1 , P < .001 ) . After 3 months , intervention surrogates had lower Decisional Conflict Scale scores than controls ( 1.65 vs 1.90 , P < .001 ) and more often discussed feeding options with a healthcare provider ( 46 % vs 33 % , P = .04 ) . Residents in the intervention group were more likely to receive a dysphagia diet ( 89 % vs 76 % , P = .04 ) and showed a trend toward greater staff eating assistance ( 20 % vs 10 % , P = .08 ) . Tube feeding was rare in both groups even after 9 months ( 1 intervention vs 3 control , P = .34 ) . CONCLUSION A decision aid about feeding options in advanced dementia reduced decisional conflict for surrogates and increased their knowledge and communication about feeding options with providers\", \"CONTEXT Decision aids can increase patient involvement in treatment decision making . However , questions remain regarding their effects and cost implication s. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effects of information , with and without a structured preference elicitation interview , on treatment choices , health outcomes , and costs . DESIGN , SETTING , AND PARTICIPANTS A r and omized controlled trial with 2 years of follow-up . Between October 1996 and February 1998 , 894 women with uncomplicated menorrhagia were recruited from 6 hospitals in southwest Engl and . Women were r and omized to the control group , information alone group ( information ) , or information plus interview group ( interview ) . INTERVENTIONS Women in both intervention groups were sent an information pack ( a booklet and complementary videotape ) 6 weeks before their specialist consultation . Immediately before their consultation , women in the interview group underwent structured interview , to clarify and elicit their preferences . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Self-reported health status was the main outcome ; secondary outcomes included treatments received and costs . Cost analyses adopted a UK health service ( payer ) perspective , and were based on patient-reported re source use data and are reported in 1999 - 2000 US dollars . RESULTS The interventions had no consistent effect on health status . Hysterectomy rates were lower for women in the interview group ( 38 % ) ( adjusted odds ratio [ OR ] , 0.60 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.38 - 0.96 ) than in the control group ( 48 % ) and women who received the information alone ( 48 % ) ( adjusted OR , 0.52 ; 95 % CI , 0.33 - 0.82 ) . The interview group had lower mean costs ( $ 1566 ) than the control group ( $ 2751 ) ( mean difference , $ 1184 ; 95 % CI , $ 684-$2110 ) and the information group $ 2026 ( mean difference , $ 461 ; 95 % CI , $ 236-$696 ) . CONCLUSIONS Neither intervention had an effect on health status . Providing women with information alone did not affect treatment choices ; however , the addition of an interview to clarify values and elicit preferences had a significant effect on women 's management and result ed in reduced costs\", 'Introduction Zambia ’s under-re source d public health system will not be able to deliver on its health-related Millennium Development Goals without a substantial acceleration in mortality reduction . Reducing mortality will depend not only upon increasing access to health care but also upon improving the quality of care that is delivered . Our project proposes to improve the quality of clinical care and to improve utilization of that care , through a targeted quality improvement ( QI ) intervention delivered at the facility and community level . Description of implementationThe project is being carried out 42 primary health care facilities that serve a largely rural population of more than 450,000 in Zambia ’s Lusaka Province . We have deployed six QI teams to implement consensus clinical protocol s , forms , and systems at each site . The QI teams define new clinical quality expectations and provide tools needed to deliver on those expectations . They also monitor the care that is provided and mentor facility staff to improve care quality . We also engage community health workers to actively refer and follow up patients .Evaluation design Project implementation occurs over a period of four years in a stepped expansion to six r and omly selected new facilities every three months . Three annual household surveys will determine population estimates of age-st and ardized mortality and under-5 mortality in each community before , during , and after implementation . Surveys will also provide measures of childhood vaccine coverage , pregnancy care utilization , and general adult health . Health facility surveys will assess coverage of primary health interventions and measures of health system effectiveness . Discussion The patient-provider interaction is an important interface where the community and the health system meet . Our project aims to reduce population mortality by substantially improving this interaction . Our success will hinge upon the ability of mentoring and continuous QI to improve clinical service delivery . It will also be critical that once the quality of services improves , increasing proportions of the population will recognize their value and begin to utilize them', \"OBJECTIVE To evaluate effects of an informational film on making an informed choice regarding second trimester ultrasound . METHOD R and omized controlled study . The intervention was an informational film about prenatal examinations . Data were collected at gestational week 26 . RESULTS A total of 184 women in the intervention group and 206 women in the control group participated in the study . Of those in the intervention group , 81.3 % made an informed choice regarding second trimester ultrasound examination compared with 76.1 % in the control group ( p = 0.21 ) . Women making an informed choice scored higher in knowledge about the examination ( p < 0.001 ) , had higher degree of education ( p < 0.001 ) , and spoke more frequently Swedish as mother tongue ( 89.5 % vs 74.7 % , p = 0.01 ) . CONCLUSIONS An informational film does not increase women 's knowledge or the number of women making an informed choice about the second trimester ultrasound . Women who did not make an informed choice about the second trimester ultrasound had a lower level of education and less knowledge about second trimester ultrasound screening\", \"RATIONALE We developed an evidence -based decision aid for patients with advanced cystic fibrosis considering referral for lung transplantation . OBJECTIVES To prospect ively evaluate whether use of the decision aid increased knowledge about the options , improved realistic expectations , and decreased decisional conflict in adult patients . METHODS We performed a single-blind r and omized controlled trial involving 149 adult patients with cystic fibrosis with an FEV(1 ) < or= 40 % predicted from 14 Canadian and Australian centers . All participants received an education and counseling session from their cystic fibrosis team and were then r and omized to receive the decision aid or usual care . The decision aid is available online at http://decisionaid.ohri.ca/decaids.html . MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS The primary end points measured were participants ' knowledge , realistic expectations , and decisional conflict evaluated 3 weeks after r and omization . Patients r and omized to the decision aid had greater knowledge about their options ( P < 0.0001 ) and had more realistic expectations about the benefits and risks of lung transplantation ( P < 0.0001 ) compared with those r and omized to usual care . The total decisional conflict score was significantly lower in the decision aid group 3 weeks postr and omization compared with the usual care group ( 11.6 vs. 20.4 ; P = 0.0007 ) . Decisions were durable ; 88 % of patients in the decision aid group and 75 % in the usual care group maintained the same choice 12 months after r and omization ( P = 0.06 ) . CONCLUSIONS Use of a decision aid for patients with cystic fibrosis considering referral for lung transplantation , in addition to usual education and counseling , improves patient knowledge , realistic expectations , decisional conflict , and patient satisfaction . Clinical trial registered with www . clinical trials.gov ( NCT00345449 )\", 'BACKGROUND Colorectal cancer is a leading cause of cancer mortality , yet effective screening tests are often underused . Electronic patient messages and personalized risk assessment s delivered via an electronic personal health record could increase screening rates . METHODS We conducted a r and omized controlled trial in 14 ambulatory health centers involving 1103 patients ranging in age from 50 to 75 years with an active electronic personal health record who were overdue for colorectal cancer screening . Patients were r and omly assigned to receive a single electronic message highlighting overdue screening status with a link to a Web-based tool to assess their personal risk of colorectal cancer .  The outcomes included colorectal cancer screening rates at 1 and 4 months . RESULTS Screening rates were higher at 1 month for patients who received electronic messages than for those who did not ( 8.3 % vs 0.2 % , P < .001 ) , but this difference was no longer significant at 4 months ( 15.8 % vs 13.1 % , P = .18 ) . Of 552 patients r and omized to receive the intervention , 296 ( 54 % ) viewed the message , and 47 ( 9 % ) used the Web-based risk assessment tool . Among 296 intervention patients who viewed the electronic message , risk tool users were more likely than nonusers to request screening examinations ( 17 % vs 4 % , P = .04 ) and to be screened ( 30 % vs 15 % , P = .06 ) . One-fifth of patients ( 19 % ) using the risk assessment tool were estimated to have an above-average risk for colorectal cancer . CONCLUSION Electronic messages to patients produce an initial increase in colorectal cancer screening rates , but this effect is not sustained over time . TRIAL REGISTRATION clinical trials.gov Identifier : NCT01032746', 'OBJECTIVE To evaluate an entertainment-based patient decision aid for early stage breast cancer surgery in low health literacy patients . METHODS Newly diagnosed female patients with early stage breast cancer from two public hospitals were r and omized to receive an entertainment-based decision aid for breast cancer treatment along with usual care ( intervention arm ) or to receive usual care only ( control arm ) . Pre-decision ( baseline ) , pre-surgery , and 1-year follow-up assessment s were conducted . RESULTS Patients assigned to the intervention arm of the study were more likely than the controls to choose mastectomy rather than breast-conserving surgery ;  however , they appeared better informed and clearer about their surgical options than women assigned to the control group . No differences in satisfaction with the surgical decision or the decision-making process were observed between the patients who viewed the intervention and those assigned to the control group . CONCLUSIONS Entertainment education may be a desirable strategy for informing lower health literate women about breast cancer surgery options . PRACTICE IMPLICATION S Incorporating patient decision aids , particularly computer-based decision aids , into st and ard clinical practice remains a challenge ; however , patients may be directed to view programs at home or at public locations ( e.g. , libraries , community centers )', 'Deciding about hormone therapy ( HT ) use is particularly complex for women with mobility impairments . While HT controls menopausal symptoms , the potential increased risk of blood clots result ing from physical inactivity can contraindicate HT use . These women , therefore , may benefit from interventions to help them tailor st and ard information about HT . We r and omly assigned women to receive either a tailored decision support intervention or st and ard menopausal information . Both groups ( n = 176 ) significantly decreased their decisional conflict and uncertainty and increased knowledge after receiving the treatment material s. We interpret the findings in the context of limited medical information about HT for women with disabilities', 'Background . The efficacy of prostate cancer ( CaP ) screening with the prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) test is debated . Most medical organizations recommend that men make individual , informed decisions about whether to undergo screening . Informed decision making ( IDM ) requires adequate knowledge about CaP as well as the risks and benefits of screening ; confidence in the ability to participate in decision making at a personally desired level ( decision self-efficacy ) ; and decision making that reflects one ’s values and preferences ( decisional consistency ) . Methods . Baseline data from a r and omized trial in 12 worksites were analyzed . Men aged 45 + ( n = 812 ) completed  surveys documenting screening history , screening preferences and decisions , CaP knowledge , decision self-efficacy , and decisional consistency . Psychosocial and demographic correlates of IDM were also assessed . Results . Approximately half of the sample had a prior PSA test , although only 35 % reported having made an explicit screening decision . Across the sample , CaP knowledge was low ( mean = 56 % ) , although decision self-efficacy was high ( mean = 78 % ) , and the majority of men ( 81 % ) made decisions consistent with their stated values . Compared with those who were undecided , men who made an explicit screening decision had significantly higher levels of knowledge , greater decisional self-efficacy , and were more consistent in terms of making a decision in alignment with their values . They tended to be white , have high levels of income and education , and had discussed screening with their health care provider . Conclusions . Many men undergo CaP screening without being fully informed about the decision . These findings support the need for interventions aim ed at improving IDM about screening , particularly among men of color , those with lower levels of income and education , and those who have not discussed screening with their provider', \"PURPOSE Decision making regarding cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( CPR ) is challenging . This study examined the effect of a video decision support tool on CPR preferences among patients with advanced cancer . PATIENTS AND METHODS We performed a r and omized controlled trial of 150 patients with advanced cancer from four oncology centers . Participants in the control arm ( n = 80 ) listened to a verbal narrative describing CPR and the likelihood of successful resuscitation . Participants in the intervention arm ( n = 70 ) listened to the identical narrative and viewed a 3-minute video depicting a patient on a ventilator and CPR being performed on a simulated patient . The primary outcome was participants ' preference for or against CPR  measured immediately after exposure to either modality . Secondary outcomes were participants ' knowledge of CPR ( score range of 0 to 4 , with higher score indicating more knowledge ) and comfort with video . RESULTS The mean age of participants was 62 years ( st and ard deviation , 11 years ) ; 49 % were women , 44 % were African American or Latino , and 47 % had lung or colon cancer . After the verbal narrative , in the control arm , 38 participants ( 48 % ) wanted CPR , 41 ( 51 % ) wanted no CPR , and one ( 1 % ) was uncertain . In contrast , in the intervention arm , 14 participants ( 20 % ) wanted CPR , 55 ( 79 % ) wanted no CPR , and 1 ( 1 % ) was uncertain ( unadjusted odds ratio , 3.5 ; 95 % CI , 1.7 to 7.2 ; P < .001 ) . Mean knowledge scores were higher in the intervention arm than in the control arm ( 3.3 ± 1.0 v 2.6 ± 1.3 , respectively ; P < .001 ) , and 65 participants ( 93 % ) in the intervention arm were comfortable watching the video . CONCLUSION Participants with advanced cancer who viewed a video of CPR were less likely to opt for CPR than those who listened to a verbal narrative\", 'Background In Japan , the cervical cancer screening rate is extremely low . Towards improving the cervical cancer screening rate , encouraging eligible people to make an informed choice , which is a decision-making process that relies on beliefs informed by adequate information about the possible benefits and risks of screening , has attracted increased attention in the public health domain . However , there is concern that providing information on possible risks of screening might prevent deter from participating . Methods In total , 1,912 women aged 20–39 years who had not participated in screening in the fiscal year were selected from a Japanese urban community setting . Participants were r and omly divided into 3 groups . Group A received a printed reminder with information about the possible benefits of screening , group B received a printed reminder with information about possible benefits and risks , and group C received a printed reminder with simple information only ( control group ) . Results Out of 1,912 participants , 169 ( 8.8 % ) participated in cervical cancer screening . In the intervention groups , 137 ( 10.9 % ) participated in cervical cancer screening , compared to only 32 ( 4.9 % ) of the control group ( p < 0.001 ) . In addition , logistic regression analysis revealed that there was no significant difference in screening rate between group A and group B ( p = 0.372 ) . Conclusions Providing information on the possible risks of screening may not prevent people from taking part in cervical cancer screening among a Japanese non-adherent population', 'Caesarean section is one of the most commonly performed operations worldwide . A variety of surgical techniques for all elements of the operation are used . Many of them have not been rigorously evaluated in r and omised controlled trials . The CORONIS Trial set out to simultaneously examine five elements of the  caesarean section operation in seven low- to middle-income countries , using a novel adaptation of the factorial design', 'A r and omised-controlled trial compared outcomes for women recently diagnosed with breast cancer who either received support and information from a multidisciplinary team or used a shared decision-making programme on an interactive video disk ( IVD ) system .  Using the IVD did not have a significant effect on the decisions women made about treatment , yet it was evaluated positively by those who used it . The results suggest that the role of clinical staff is more significant than the form of information provided . Potential benefits for the IVD were apparent such as st and ardising the information received by patients , promoting evidence -based practice and providing a measure for quality assurance', 'OBJECTIVE : To improve human papillomavirus ( HPV ) vaccination rates , we studied the effectiveness of targeting automated decision support to families , clinicians , or both . METHODS : Twenty-two primary care practice s were cluster-r and omized to receive a 3-part clinician-focused intervention ( education , electronic health record-based alerts , and audit and feedback ) or none . Overall , 22 486 girls aged 11 to 17 years due for HPV vaccine dose 1 , 2 , or 3 were r and omly assigned within each practice to receive family-focused decision support with educational telephone calls . R and omization established 4 groups : family-focused , clinician-focused , combined , and no intervention . We measured decision support effectiveness by final vaccination rates and time to vaccine receipt , st and ardized for covariates and limited to those having received the previous dose for HPV # 2 and 3 . The 1-year study began in May 2010 . RESULTS : Final vaccination rates for HPV # 1 , 2 , and 3 were 16 % , 65 % , and 63 % among controls . The combined intervention increased vaccination rates by 9 , 8 , and 13 percentage points , respectively . The control group achieved 15 % vaccination for HPV # 1 and 50 % vaccination for HPV # 2 and 3 after 318 , 178 , and 215 days . The combined intervention significantly accelerated vaccination by 151 , 68 , and 93 days . The clinician-focused intervention was more effective than the family-focused intervention for HPV # 1 , but less effective for HPV # 2 and 3 . CONCLUSIONS : A clinician-focused intervention was most effective for initiating the HPV vaccination series , whereas a family-focused intervention promoted completion . Decision support directed at both clinicians and families most effectively promotes HPV vaccine series receipt', \"OBJECTIVE : To assess the impact of providing an educational videotape , ' Treatment Choices for Ischaemic Heart Disease : a Shared Decision-Making Program Videotape , ' to patients referred for coronary angiography compared with st and ard patient-physician decision making ( usual care ) .  STUDY DESIGN : R and omized controlled clinical trial . SETTING : University Hospital and Veterans Affairs Hospital . PATIENTS : A consecutive sample of 217 patients referred for coronary angiography were r and omized to receive ' usual care ' or to receive the videotape in addition to st and ard patient physician decision making ( videotape ) : 109 completed the study ( 50 % completion rate ) . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES : Knowledge of coronary artery disease , satisfaction , self-reported physical and mental health functioning , and the proportion of patients who were referred for coronary revascularization . RESULTS : Compared with patients who received ' usual care , ' those who received the videotape were more knowledgeable ( mean score 83 vs. 58 % ; P < 0.0001 ) but less satisfied with their treatment ( 79 vs. 88 % ; P = 0.038 ) . There were no significant differences between the videotape and ' usual care ' groups with respect to satisfaction with the decision making process ( mean score 73 vs. 77 % ; P = 0.37 ) , satisfaction with the decision made ( mean score 73 vs. 78 % ; P = 0.28 ) , physical functioning ( 38 vs. 38 % ; P = 0.76 ) , mental health functioning ( 49 vs. 49 % ; P = 0.94 ) , or in referral for coronary revascularization ( OR 0.60 ; 95 % CI 0.22 - 1.65 ; P = 0.33 ) . CONCLUSION : Although the educational videotape increased patients ' knowledge level , it was associated with a decrease in their level of satisfaction with treatment . Before there is wide-spread dissemination of this technology , advocates should demonstrate its effectiveness in everyday practice\", 'Background Obtaining informed consent is an essential step in the surgical pathway . Providing adequate patient education to enable informed decision making is a continued challenge of contemporary surgical practice . This study investigates whether the use of a patient information website , to augment patient education and informed consent for elective orthopaedic procedures is an effective measure . Methods A r and omised controlled trial was conducted comparing the quality of informed consent provided by a st and ard discussion with the treating surgeon compared to augmentation of this discussion with an online education re source ( www.orthoanswer.org ) . Participants were recruited from orthopaedic outpatient clinics . Patients undergoing five common orthopaedic procedures were eligible to participate in the trial . The primary outcome measure was knowledge about their operation . Satisfaction with their informed consent and anxiety relating to their operation were the secondary outcome measures . Results There was a statistically significant increase in patient knowledge for the intervention arm as compared to the control arm ( p < 0.01 ) . Patients in the intervention arm , had an average score of 69.25 % ( SD 14.91 ) correct answers as compared to 47.38 % ( SD 17.77 ) in the control arm . Satisfaction was also improved in the intervention arm ( p = 0.043 ) . There was no statistically significant difference between the control and intervention arm relating to their anxiety scores ( p = 0.195 ) . Conclusions The use of a patient education website as an augment to informed consent improves patient knowledge about their planned operation as well as satisfaction with the consent process whilst not increasing their anxiety levels . We recommend that all patients be directed to web based education tools to augment their consent .

On the one h and , information uptake may be hampered , and additional stress could be inflicted by involving these patients . On the other h and , even patients with advanced cancer desire information on risks and prognosis . To settle the debate , a decision aid will be developed and presented to patients with advanced disease at the point of decision making . The aid is used to assess the amount of information desired . Factors related to information desire are explored , as well as the ability of the medical oncologist to judge the patient 's information desire . The effects of the information on patient well-being are assessed by comparing the decision aid group with a usual care group . Methods / Design This study is a r and omized controlled trial of patients with advanced colorectal , breast , or ovarian cancer who have started treatment with first-line palliative chemotherapy .  The trial will consist of 100 patients in the decision aid group and 70 patients in the usual care group .  To collect complete data of 170 patients , 246 patients will be approached for the study . Patients will complete a baseline question naire on sociodemographic data , well-being measures , and psychological measures , believed to predict information desire . The medical oncologist will judge the patient 's information desire . After disease progression is diagnosed , the medical oncologist offers the choice between second-line palliative chemotherapy plus best supportive care ( BSC ) and BSC alone . R and omization will take place to determine whether patients will receive usual care ( n = 70 ) or usual care and the decision aid ( n = 100 ) . The aid offers information about the potential risks and benefits of both treatment options , in terms of adverse events , tumour response , and survival . Patients decide for each item whether they desire the information or not . Two follow-up question naires will evaluate the effect of the decision aid . Discussion This study attempts to settle the debate on the desirability of informing patients with cancer . In contrast to several earlier studies , we will actually deliver information on treatment options to patients at the point of decision making .

This paper presents a longitudinal , experimental study evaluating a computer-based contraceptive decision aid in Chicago and Madison family planning clinic visits . Patient interviews at three time points evaluated patient acceptance by  and  program impact on 949 young women . Both Chicago and Madison patients reported high acceptance . The program result ed in improved short-term knowledge and confidence in oral contraceptive ( OC ) efficacy for Chicago and Madison patients . In addition , compared to their control group , Madison experimental group patients had higher OC knowledge 1 year after the initial visit and a trend for fewer pregnancies ( P < 0.074 ) . Compared to their control group , a higher percent of the Chicago experimental group patients adopted OC 's after stating their intention to do so at the initial visit . Exposure to the computer program had no observable impact on the number of months on the oral contraceptive for Chicago or Madison patients . Overall findings suggest the usefulness of informatics tools as a supplement to patient-provider interactions\", 'BACKGROUND Patient involvement in the choice of antihyperglycemic agents could improve adherence and optimize glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus . METHODS We conducted a pilot , cluster r and omized trial of Diabetes Medication Choice , a decision aid that describes 5 antihyperglycemic drugs , their treatment burden ( adverse effects , administration , and self-monitoring dem and s ) , and impact on hemoglobin A(1c ) ( HbA(1c ) ) levels . Twenty-one clinicians were r and omized to use the decision aid during the clinical encounter and 19 to dispense usual care and an educational pamphlet . We used surveys and video analysis to assess postvisit decisional outcomes , and medical and pharmacy records to assess 6-month medication adherence and HbA(1c ) levels . RESULTS Compared with usual care patients ( n = 37 ) , patients receiving the decision aid ( n = 48 ) found the tool more helpful ( clustered-adjusted mean difference [ AMD ] in a 7-point scale , 0.38 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.04 - 0.72 ) ; had improved knowledge ( AMD , 1.10 of 10 questions ; 95 % CI , 0.11 - 2.09 ) ; and had more involvement in making decisions about diabetes medications ( AMD , 21.8 of 100 ; 95 % CI , 13.0 - 30.5 ) . At 6-month follow-up , both groups had nearly perfect medication use ( median , 100 % of days covered ) , with better adherence ( AMD , 9 % more days covered ; 95 % CI , 4%-14 % ) and persistence ( AMD , 12 more days covered ; 95 % CI , 3 - 21 days ) in the usual care group , and no significant impact on HbA(1c ) levels ( AMD , 0.01 ; 95 % CI , -0.49 to 0.50 ) . CONCLUSION An innovative decision aid effectively involved patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in decisions about their medications but did not improve adherence or HbA(1c ) levels . Trial Registration clinical trials.gov Identifier : NCT00388050', 'It remains uncertain whether members of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer ( HBOC ) families experience  psychological distress with genetic testing and whether pre‐test counseling can have a moderating effect on client well‐being . One purpose of this study was to assess change in psychological well‐being from baseline to 6–9 months follow‐up and the effect of a problem‐solving training ( PST ) intervention on psychological well‐being . Two hundred and twelve members of 13 HBOC families were offered BRCA1/2 testing for a previously identified family mutation . Participants received education and were r and omized to one of two counseling interventions ; PST or client‐centered counseling .  Psychological well‐being was assessed at baseline and again at 6–9 months following the receipt of test results , or at the equivalent time for those participants who chose not to undergo testing . Well‐being was assessed using measures of depressive symptoms ( CESD ) , intrusive thoughts ( IES ) , cancer worries , and self‐esteem . Comparisons were made between those who chose testing and those who did not as well as between those who received positive and negative test results . One hundred eighty one participants elected to undergo genetic testing ( 85 % ) and 47 of these ( 26 % ) were identified as BRCA1/2 mutation carriers  . Breast and ovarian cancer worries decreased significantly ( p = 0.007 and 0.008 , respectively ) in those who tested negative while there was no appreciable change in psychological well‐being from baseline to follow‐up in either those who tested positive or in non‐testers . Among all participants , particularly testers , those r and omized to PST had a greater reduction in depressive symptoms than those r and omized to client‐centered counseling ( p < 0.05 and p = 0.02 , respectively ) . Regardless of the decision to test , individuals with a personal history of cancer ( n = 22 ) were more likely to have an increase in breast cancer worries compared to those who had never been diagnosed with cancer ( p < 0.001 ) . Results suggest that a problem‐solving counseling intervention may help to enhance psychological well‐being following testing and that a personal history of cancer may increase psychological distress associated with genetic testing . Published 2004 Wiley‐Liss ,', 'In early 1983 , all 1,280 faculty and resident physicians at one hospital who were eligible to be vaccinated against hepatitis B  were divided r and omly into three groups : Group 1 physicians received general information about the risks and benefits of alternative vaccine decisions ; Group 2 physicians were additionally invited to provide personal information for an individualized decision analysis ( 12.6 percent responded ) ; and Group 3  physicians  , who served as controls , were not contacted . In one year \\'s follow-up , 20 percent of physicians were screened for hepatitis B antibody or vaccinated . More Group 2 physicians whose decision analyses recommended screening or vaccination took these actions ( 39 percent ) than any other group . Group assignment remained significantly associated with vaccine decisions after analyzing results by the \" intention to treat \" principle , and after adjusting for training status , exposure to blood and blood products , and pre- study intentions about the vaccine . Despite the low overall vaccine acceptance rate , it is concluded that individualized decision analysis can influence the clinical decisions taken by knowledgeable and interested patients', 'Introduction : The  Decisional Conflict Scale  ( DCS , 16 items , 5 dimensions ) design ed to measure the level of decisional conflict experienced by patients making health care decisions has not yet been vali date d in French . Methods : A national sample of French cancer patients ( n = 644 ) facing the decision to undergo BRCA genetic testing  was tested for this purpose , including a control group and an experimental group who had received an information booklet .  Reliability and criterion validity were investigated . To check the validity of the factors selected , an exploratory factor analysis was then conducted , followed by confirmatory factor analyses . Results : Reliability was satisfactory ( α = 0.913 ) . Women who definitely wanted to undergo genetic testing showed significantly lower DCS scores than uncertain women ( p<0.001 ) . Exploratory factor analysis suggested an optimal 4-dimensional model . In the control group , confirmatory factor analyses showed that the French model was more accurate than the original one . When the decision-making conflicts decreased ( in the experimental group ) , both models yielded only fairly accurate indices . Conclusion : The French version of the DCS was found to give a reliable overall score . However , special care should be taken when using the individual subscores . In addition , it is necessary to take into account the context in which the decision-making occurs', 'Background : Direct-to-consumer ( DTC ) BRCA testing may exp and access to genetic testing and enhance cancer prevention efforts . It is not known , however , if current DTC websites provide adequate risk information for informed medical decision making . Methods : A total of 284 women with a personal or family history of breast/ovarian cancer were r and omly assigned to view a “ mock ” DTC commercial website [ control condition ( CC ) ; n = 93 ] or the same “ mock ” website that included information on the potential risks of obtaining genetic testing online . Risk information was framed two ways : risk information attributed to expert sources ( ES ; n = 98 ) and unattributed risk information ( URI ; n = 93 ) . Participants completed an online survey . End points were intentions to get BRCA testing , testing site preference , and beliefs about DTC BRCA testing . Results : The sample was 82 % white , had a mean age of 39 years ( range , 18 - 70 years ) and had a mean education of 3 years of college . Women exposed to risk information had lower intentions to get BRCA testing than women in the CC [ adjusted odds ratio ( OR ) , 0.48 ; 95 % confidence interval ( 95 % CI ) 0.26 - 0.87 ; P = 0.016 ] , and less positive beliefs about online BRCA testing ( adjusted OR , 0.48 ; 95 % CI , 0.27 - 0.86 ; P = 0.014 ) . Women in the ES condition were more likely to prefer clinic-based testing than were women in the CC ( adjusted OR , 2.05 ; 95 % CI , 1.07 - 3.90 ; P = 0.030 ) . Conclusion : Exposing women to information on the potential risks of online BRCA testing altered their intentions , beliefs , and preferences for BRCA testing . Policy makers may want to consider the content and framing of risk information on DTC websites as they formulate regulation for this rapidly growing industry .

This study evaluates the effect of a patient decision aid ( PtDA ) design ed to help men decide whether or not to have a vasectomy . STUDY DESIGN Men considering vasectomy were r and omized to an experimental group that received a full PtDA containing information and values guidance ( n=32 ) or to a control group that received an abridged PtDA containing information only ( n=31 ) . RESULTS Mean Decisional Conflict Scale ( DCS ) scores before and after the intervention were 2.6±0.4 and 1.9±0.4 in the experimental group and 2.5±0.4 and 1.8±0.4 in the control group ( p=.94 ) , respectively . Mean knowledge of vasectomy scores before and after the intervention were 50%±16 % and 72%±18 % in the experimental group and 55%±18 % and 71%±15 % in the control group ( p=.40 ) , respectively . At baseline , all participants were undecided as to whether to have a vasectomy . After the intervention , 60 % of experimental group participants and 53 % of control group participants had made a definite decision ( p=.58 ) . CONCLUSION In men considering vasectomy , both versions of the PtDAs improved the quality of decision-making process to a similar extent . Information alone may be sufficient to support good decision making in these patients', \"The aim of this secondary analysis was to compare the effects of a tailored decision aid ( DA ) with those of a pamphlet on the agreement between women 's and physicians ' decisional conflict about hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) . A total of 40 physicians and 184 women provided data . The agreement between women 's and physicians ' decisional conflict scores was measured using the intraclass correlation coefficient ( ICC ) . The ICC was higher for dyads in the DA group ( ICC=0.44 ; 95 % confidence interval (CI)=0.25 - 0.59 ) compared to the pamphlet group ( ICC=0.28 ; 95 % CI=0.06 - 0.47 ) . When the average score of decisional conflict of women nested within a physician and of each physician were used , the ICC for the DA group and the pamphlet group was 0.41 ( 95 % CI=-0.04 to 0.72 ) and 0.06 ( 95 % CI=-0.41 to 0.49 ) , respectively . Compared to pamphlets , DAs appear to improve the agreement between women 's and physicians ' decisional conflict about HRT\", \"OBJECTIVE Decision aids purport to help patients make treatment related choices . Several instruments exist to evaluate decision aids . Our aim is to compare the responsiveness of several instruments . METHODS  Two different decision aids were r and omized in patients at high risk for breast and ovarian cancer . Treatment choices were between prophylactic surgery and screening . Effect sizes were calculated to compare the responsiveness of the measures . RESULTS One decision aid was r and omized in 390 women , the other in 91 ensuing mutation carriers . Three factors were identified related to Information , Well-being and Decision Making . Within each factor , single item measures were as responsive as multi-item measures . CONCLUSION Four single items , ' the amount of information received for decision making , ' ' strength of preference , ' ' I weighed the pros and cons , ' and ' General Health , ' were adequately responsive to the decision aids . PRACTICE IMPLICATION S These items might be considered for inclusion in question naires to evaluate decision aids\", 'Heart failure poses a substantial burden on health care expenditures and quality of life ; therefore , strategies to improve health behaviors for heart failure are essential . Highly effective medical decision aids can enable health improvements for people with heart failure . In this r and omized controlled study , individuals with heart failure in a private Medicare plan were r and omized into either an intervention or control group . Participants in the intervention group received basic program information and a simple fact sheet about heart failure , plus a medical decision aid , Living with Heart Failure DVD and booklet ; patients r and omized to the control group received the basic written material s only . The study was powered to detect a 5 % difference in the primary outcome measure ( daily weight monitoring ) . Participants were surveyed 4 weeks after outreach material s were mailed . There were 480 survey respondents : 246 in the intervention group ; 234 in the control group . Intervention group respondents were significantly more likely to weigh themselves daily ( P=0.05 ) than control group respondents ( 44 % versus 38 % ) . The intervention group was more likely than the control group to monitor fluid intake ( 47 % versus 44 % ) and follow a low-sodium diet ( 83 % versus 77 % ) . Other health behavior differences were not statistically significant . The DVD decision aid increased levels of daily weight monitoring and other important health behaviors . Broad application of inexpensive behavior change interventions , such as a DVD/booklet program , should help to facilitate important , routine self-care behaviors for individuals with heart failure', 'Objective To evaluate the effects of a decision aid for menorrhagia  on treatment outcomes and costs over a 12‐month follow‐up', \"Due to the complexity of information surrounding BRCA1/2 counseling and testing and its time consuming nature , efforts to facilitate the genetic counseling and education process are needed . Using a 2 × 2 factorial design , two strategies were examined : a CD‐ROM program for patients and a feedback checklist to the genetic counselor on patients ' prior misconceptions . A total of 197 women attending a breast and ovarian cancer risk evaluation clinic for BRCA1/2 counseling were r and omized into one of four conditions : st and ard care , CD‐ROM only , feedback to counselor only , and both CD‐ROM and feedback . Counseling outcomes included face‐to‐face time with the genetics team , knowledge acquisition , changes in worry about having a gene mutation , and genetic testing decisions . Overall , women who viewed the CD‐ROM spent less time with the genetic counselor and were less likely to undergo genetic testing compared to women who did not view the CD‐ROM . Feedback to the genetic counselor result ed in greater gains in knowledge of genetics and breast cancer . Among women less worried at baseline , those who viewed the CD‐ROM showed no changes in worry following genetic counseling , in contrast to those who did not view the CD‐ROM who increased in worry over time . This latter finding raises concerns about the impact of the increased worry on genetic testing decisions . No interaction effects of the two intervention arms were found . The study results support the importance of both strategies as valuable supplements to clinical BRCA1/2 counseling . © 2005 Wiley‐Liss ,\", \"IMPORTANCE Given minority patients ' unequal access to quality care , patient activation and self-management strategies have been suggested as a promising approach to improving mental health care . OBJECTIVE To determine whether the DECIDE ( Decide the problem ; Explore the questions ; Closed or open-ended questions ; Identify the who , why , or how of the problem ; Direct questions to your health care professional ; Enjoy a shared solution ) intervention , an educational strategy that teaches patients to ask questions and make collaborative decisions with their health care professional , improves patient activation and self-management , as well as engagement and retention in behavioral health care . DESIGN , SETTING , AND PATIENTS In this multisite r and omized clinical trial performed from February 1 , 2009 , through October 9 , 2011 ( date of last follow-up interview ) , we recruited 647 English- or Spanish-speaking patients 18 to 70 years old from 13 outpatient community mental health clinics across 5 states and 1 US territory . A total of 722 patients were included in analyses of secondary outcomes . INTERVENTIONS Three DECIDE training sessions delivered by a care manager vs giving patients a brochure on management of behavioral health . MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Primary outcomes were patient assessment of activation ( Patient Activation Scale ) and self-management ( Perceived Efficacy in Patient-Physician Interactions ) . Secondary outcomes included patient engagement ( proportion of visits attended of those scheduled ) and retention ( attending at least 4 visits in the 6 months after the baseline research assessment ) , collected through medical record review or electronic records . RESULTS Patients assigned to DECIDE reported significant increases in activation ( mean β = 1.74 , SD = 0.58 ; P = .003 ) and self-management ( mean β = 2.42 , SD = 0.90 ; P = .008 ) relative to control patients , but there was no evidence of an effect on engagement or retention in care . CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The DECIDE intervention appears to help patients learn to effectively ask questions and participate in decisions about their behavioral health care , but a health care professional component might be needed to augment engagement in care . DECIDE appears to have promise as a strategy for changing the role of minority patients in behavioral health care . TRIAL REGISTRATION clinical trials.gov Identifier :\", 'Abstract BACKGROUND : Little is known about the relative advantages of video versus internet-based decision aids to facilitate shared medical decision making . This study compared internet and video patient education modalities for men considering the prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) test . METHODS : Two hundred and twenty-six men , aged 50 years or older , and scheduled to complete a physical examination at an HMO Health Appraisal Clinic were r and omly assigned to access a website ( N=114 ) or view a 23-minute videotape in the clinic ( N=112 ) prior to deciding whether they wanted to be screened for prostate cancer . RESULTS : There were no between-groups differences in participants ’ ratings of convenience , effort , or satisfaction following exposure to the decision aid . Participants assigned to the video group were more likely to review the material s than individuals assigned to the internet group ( 98.2 % vs 53.5 % ) . Participants in the video group showed significantly greater increases in PSA knowledge and were more likely to decline the PSA test than individuals assigned to the internet group . However , participants in the internet group who review ed the entire online presentation showed similar increases in PSA knowledge as video participants . Only 5 % of all participants visited other websites to inform themselves about the PSA test . CONCLUSIONS : Overall , the video was significantly more effective than the Internet in educating participants about benefits and risks of PSA screening', 'Purpose Breast cancer survivors who make preference-sensitive decisions about postmastectomy breast reconstruction often have large gaps in knowledge and undergo procedures that are misaligned with their treatment goals . We evaluated the feasibility and effect of a pre-consultation educational group intervention on the decision-making process for breast reconstruction . Methods We conducted a pilot r and omized controlled trial ( RCT ) where participants were r and omly assigned to the intervention with routine education or routine education alone .  The outcomes evaluated were decisional conflict , decision self-efficacy , satisfaction with information , perceived involvement in care , and uptake of reconstruction following surgical consultation . Trial feasibility and acceptability were evaluated , and effect sizes were calculated to determine the primary outcome for the full-scale RCT . Results Of the 41 patients enrolled , recruitment rate was 72 % , treatment fidelity was 98 % , and retention rate was 95 % . The Cohen ’s d effect size in reduction of decisional conflict was moderate to high for the intervention group compared to routine education ( 0.69 , 95 % CI = 0.02–1.42 ) , while the effect sizes of increase in decision self-efficacy ( 0.05 , 95 % CI = −0.60–0.71 ) and satisfaction with information ( 0.11 , 95 % CI = −0.53–0.76 ) were small . A higher proportion of patients receiving routine education signed informed consent to undergo breast reconstruction ( 14/20 or 70 % ) compared to the intervention group ( 8/21 or 38 % ) P = 0.06 . Conclusions A pre-consultation educational group intervention  improves patients ’ shared decision-making quality compared to routine preoperative patient education . A full-scale definitive RCT is warranted based on high feasibility outcomes , and the primary outcome for the main trial will be decisional conflict', \"Background : Decision aids have been shown to be useful in selected situations to assist patients in making treatment decisions . Important features such as the format of decision aids and their graphic presentation of data on benefits and harms of treatment options have not been well studied . Methods : In a r and omized trial with a 3 × 2 factorial design , we investigated the effects of decision aid format ( decision board , decision booklet with audiotape , or interactive computer program ) and graphic presentation of data ( pie graph or pictogram ) on patients ' comprehension and choices of 3 treatments for anticoagulation , identified initially as “ treatment A ” ( warfarin ) , “ treatment B ” ( acetylsalicylic acid ) and “ treatment C ” ( no treatment ) .  Patients aged 65 years or older without known atrial fibrillation and not currently taking warfarin were included . The effect of blinding to the treatment name was tested in a before – after comparison . The primary outcome was change in comprehension score , as assessed by the Atrial Fibrillation Information Question naire . Secondary outcomes were treatment choice , level of satisfaction with the decision aid , and decisional conflict . Results : Of 102 eligible patients , 98 completed the study . Comprehension scores ( maximum score 10 ) increased by an absolute mean of 3.1 ( p < 0.01 ) after exposure to the decision aid regardless of the format or graphic presentation . Overall , 96 % of the participants felt that the decision aid helped them make their treatment choice . Unblinding of the treatment name result ed in 36 % of the participants changing their initial choice ( p < 0.001 ) . Interpretation : The decision aid led to significant improvement in patients ' knowledge regardless of the format or graphic representation of data . Revealing the name of the treatment options led to significant shifts in declared treatment preferences\", 'Purpose : To assess the effectiveness of computerized familial risk assessment and tailored messages for identifying individuals for targeted cancer prevention strategies and motivating behavior change . Methods : We conducted a r and omized clinical trial in primary care patients aged 35–65 years using Family Healthware  , a self-administered , internet-based tool that collects family history for six common diseases including breast cancer , colon cancer , and ovarian cancer , stratifies risk into three tiers , and provides tailored prevention messages .  Cancer screening adherence and consultation were measured at baseline and 6-month follow-up . Results : Of 3283 participants , 34 % were at strong or moderate risk of at least one of the cancers . Family Healthware identified additional participants for whom earlier screening ( colon cancer , 4.4 % ; breast cancer , women ages : 35–39 years , 9 % ) or genetic assessment ( colon cancer , 2.5 % ; breast cancer , 10 % ; and ovarian cancer , 4 % ) may be indicated . Fewer than half were already adherent with risk-based screening . Screening adherence improved for all risk categories with no difference between intervention and control groups . Consultation with specialists did not differ between groups . Conclusion : Family Healthware identified patients for intensified cancer prevention . Engagement of clinicians and patients , integration with clinical decision support , and inclusion of nonfamilial risk factors may be necessary to achieve the full potential of computerized risk assessment', 'OBJECTIVE To develop and pilot two computer-based decision aids to assist women with decision-making about mode of delivery after a previous caesarean section ( CS ) , which could then be evaluated in a r and omized-controlled trial . BACKGROUND Women with a previous CS are faced with a decision between repeat elective CS and vaginal birth after caesarean . Research has shown that women may benefit from access to comprehensive information about the risks and benefits of the delivery options . DESIGN A qualitative pilot study of two novel decision aids , an information program and a decision analysis program , which were developed by a multidisciplinary research team . PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING 15 women who had recently given birth and had previously had a CS and 11 pregnant women with a previous CS , recruited from two UK hospitals . Women were interviewed and observed using the decision aids . RESULTS Participants found both decision aids useful and informative . Most liked the computer-based format . Participants found the utility assessment of the decision analysis program acceptable although some had difficulty completing the tasks required . Following the pilot study improvements were made to exp and the program content , the decision analysis program was accompanied by a training session and a website version of the information program was developed to allow repeat access . CONCLUSIONS This pilot study was an essential step in the design of the decision aids and in establishing their acceptability and feasibility . In general , participating women viewed the decision aids as a welcome addition to routine antenatal care . A r and omized trial has been conducted to establish the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the decision aids', 'Objective : To determine the efficacy of a computerised decision aid in patients with atrial fibrillation making decisions on whether to take warfarin or aspirin therapy .  Design : Two-armed open exploratory r and omised controlled trial . Setting : Two research clinics deriving participants from general practice s in Northeast Engl and . Participants : 109 patients with atrial fibrillation aged over 60 . Interventions : Computerised decision aid applied in shared decision-making clinic compared to evidence -based paper guidelines applied as direct advice . Main outcome measures : Primary outcome measure was the decision conflict scale . Secondary outcome measures included anxiety , knowledge , decision-making preference , treatment decision , use of primary and secondary care services and health outcomes . Results : Decision conflict was lower in the computerised decision aid group immediately after the clinic ; mean difference −0.18 ( 95 % CI −0.34 to −0.01 ) . Participants in this group not already on warfarin were much less likely to start warfarin  than those in the guidelines arm ( 4/16 , 25 % compared to the guidelines group 15/16 , 93.8 % , RR 0.27 , 95 % CI 0.11 to 0.63 ) . Conclusions : Decision conflict was lower immediately following the use of a computerised decision aid in a shared decision-making consultation than immediately following direct doctor-led advice based on paper guidelines . Furthermore , participants in the computerised decision aid group were significantly much less likely to start warfarin  than those in the guidelines arm . The results show that such an approach has a positive impact on decision conflict comparable to other studies of decision aids , but also reduces the uptake of a clinical ly effective treatment that may have important implication s for health outcomes', 'The authors assessed whether patient empowerment in the management of hypertension improved more with the practice of shared decision making ( SDM ) than by education programs . In a prospect i ve controlled clinical study , 15 general practitioners in Nuremberg , Germany who were specially trained to conduct SDM consultations participated in a 12-month study . Hypertensive patients ( N=86 ) were included ; N=40 were in the SDM group and N=46 were in the control group , if blood pressures were > or = 135 / 85 mm Hg ( self measurement ) and patients had no signs of cardiovascular complications or severe hypertension . All participants in the SDM group and the control group were enrolled in an education program on hypertension in small groups . The SDM group participants also had 4 special consultations to share medical decisions . The main outcome measures were the effect of SDM on blood pressure control . After 1 year blood pressure had decreased in all participants : Delta-9.26 + /- 10.2 mm Hg/Delta-5.33 + /- 9.5 mm Hg in the SDM group ( P<0.001 ) compared to Delta-6.0 + /- 11.8 mm Hg/Delta-3.0 + /- 8.3 mm Hg in the control group . There was no significant difference between the 2 groups . The study group practice d more  SDM  than controls , but blood pressure control was not significantly better . Patient empowerment by means of an education program in small groups and creating awareness of hypertensive disease helps to improve the outcome of hypertension treatment .  SDM , however , did not improve management when compared to an education program , which is much easier to implement in general practice', \"PURPOSE We tested whether a decision aid explaining how to discuss the approach of death with a family member with cancer would help family caregivers decide to discuss a terminal prognosis . PATIENTS AND METHODS We r and omly assigned caregivers of terminally ill patients with cancer to a group that received a video and a companion workbook that showed either how they can discuss the prognosis with their patient ( experimental arm ) or how cancer pain can be controlled ( control arm ) . At baseline and 1 month , we evaluated the decision to discuss terminal prognosis as the primary outcome . At 0 , 1 , 3 , and 6 months , we assessed the caregivers ' decisional conflict and satisfaction as secondary outcomes using a Decision Conflict Scale ( DCS ) . RESULTS We found no difference in changes in the decision to discuss terminal prognosis between the two groups . Conflict ( P = .003 ) , uncertainty ( P = .019 ) , and value clarity ( P = .007 ) subscale scores and total DCS score ( P = .008 ) improved from baseline to 1 month significantly more in the experimental arm than in the control arm . Over 6 months , the significant between-group differences continued for the conflict ( P = .031 ) , uncertainty ( P = .014 ) , and value clarity ( P = .039 ) subscale scores and total DCS score ( P = .040 ) . CONCLUSION Decision aids can help caregivers , with the aid of trained professionals , to communicate with patients about their terminal illness\", 'African American men bear disproportionate burden of prostate cancer ( PCa ) that can be reduced by early detection . A 15-minute culturally appropriate PCa education intervention developed to communicate effective , relevant , and balanced PCa screening information to low-income African American men was evaluated in men 42 years and older who had not been screened in one year . Of 539 men enrolled , 392 ( 72.7 % ) completed the six-month follow-up . Mean age was 54.4±8.9 , 34.7 % had no high school diploma , and 65.3 % earned less than $ 25,000 annually . Barriers to screening included health insurance ( 41.4 % ) , discomfort of digital rectal exam ( 32.1 % ) , and fear of cancer diagnosis ( 29.9 % ) . Mean knowledge score of 21 points increased from 13.27±3.51 to 14.95±4.14 ( p<.001 ) , and prostate-specific antigen screening from 22.1 % to 62.8 % . Men without high school diploma recorded the lowest post-intervention PCa knowledge and screening rate ( 47.7 % ) , suggestive of the need for more than a single education session . Annual physicals with free prostate examination can maintain the positive trend observed', 'OBJECTIVE To evaluate the addition of structured contraceptive counseling to usual care on choice , initiation , and continuation of very effective contraception after uterine aspiration . METHODS We conducted a RCT of a version of the WHO Decision-Making Tool for Family Planning Clients and Providers with women having a procedure for a spontaneous or induced abortion . Our intervention provided structured , st and ardized counseling . We r and omized women to usual care or usual care with structured counseling . Our outcomes included choosing a very effective contraceptive method and 3 months continuation . RESULTS Fifty-four percent of all participants chose a very effective method . Women in the intervention group were no more likely to choose a very effective method ( OR 0.74 , 95 % CI 0.44 , 1.26 ) or to initiate their method compared to the usual care group ( OR 0.65 , 95 % CI 0.31 , 1.34 ) . In multivariate models , structured counseling was not associated with using a very effective method at 3 months ( AOR 1.06 , 95 % CI 0.53 , 2.14 ) . CONCLUSION In this setting , structured counseling had little impact on contraceptive method choice , initiation , or continuation . PRACTICE IMPLICATION S Adding structured counseling did not increase the proportion choosing or initiating very effective contraception in a practice setting where physicians already provide individualized counseling', 'Background Decision aids offer promise as a practical solution to improve patient decision making about coronary heart disease ( CHD ) prevention medications and help patients choose medications to which they are likely to adhere . However , little data is available on decision aids design ed to promote adherence . Methods In this paper , we report on secondary analyses of a r and omized trial of a CHD adherence intervention ( second generation decision aid plus tailored messages ) versus usual care in an effort to underst and how the decision aid facilitates adherence . We focus on data collected from the primary study visit , when  intervention participants presented 45 minutes early to a previously scheduled provider visit ; viewed the decision aid , indicating their intent for CHD risk reduction after each decision aid component ( individualized risk assessment and education , values clarification , and coaching ) ; and filled out a post-decision aid survey assessing their knowledge , perceived risk , decisional conflict , and intent for CHD risk reduction . Control participants  did not present early and received usual care from their provider . Following the provider visit , participants in both groups completed post-visit surveys assessing the number and quality of CHD discussion s with their provider , their intent for CHD risk reduction , and their feelings about the decision aid . Results We enrolled 160 patients into our study ( 81 intervention , 79  control ) . Within the decision aid group , the decision aid significantly increased knowledge of effective CHD prevention strategies ( + 21 percentage points ; adjusted p<.0001 ) and the accuracy of perceived CHD risk ( + 33 percentage points ; adjusted p<.0001 ) , and significantly decreased decisional conflict ( -0.63 ; adjusted p<.0001 ) . Comparing between study groups , the decision aid also significantly increased CHD prevention discussion s with providers ( + 31 percentage points ; adjusted p<.0001 ) and improved perceptions of some features of patient-provider interactions . Further , it increased participants ’ intentions for any effective CHD risk reducing strategies ( + 21 percentage points ; 95 % CI 5 to 37 percentage points ) , with a majority of the effect from the educational component of the decision aid . Ninety-nine percent of participants found the decision aid easy to underst and and 93 % felt it easy to use . Conclusions Decision aids can play an important role in improving decisions about CHD prevention and increasing patient-provider discussion s and intent to reduce CHD risk', 'Background R and omised trials provide evidence that  patient decision aids  improve outcomes with respect to patient knowledge , involvement and satisfaction in decision making . It is less clear how these complex interventions are implemented within patient-clinician interactions and which components are active for improving decision processes . To investigate the experiences of using a  diabetes treatment decision aid and to explore how components within a complex intervention influenced the decision making process . Methods A pragmatic mixed methods study nested within the P AND As cluster r and omised trial of a patient decision aid .  Themes inductively derived from interviews and observation of consultations with further triangulation with results of decision quality and involvement measurements and case analyses . Results The decision aid intervention was employed flexibly within the consultation with both the patient and clinician active in marshalling elements . The decision aid improved processing and organization of information needed for decision making within the consultation interaction . It also improved decision quality by preparing the patient for active involvement within the clinical consultation . Conclusion The intervention was acceptable , flexible and readily implemented in primary care consultations . The decision aid was effective in facilitating cognitive processing . The intervention also facilitated rehearsal in preparation for active roles in a shared decision process . Trial registration Trials Register Number : IS RCT N14842077 . Date registered : 24.06.2010', 'OBJECTIVE Poor adherence to therapy , perhaps related to unaddressed patient preferences , limits the effectiveness of osteoporosis treatment in at-risk women . A parallel patient-level r and omized trial in primary care practice s was performed . METHODS Eligible postmenopausal women with bone mineral density T-scores less than -1.0 and not receiving bisphosphonate therapy were included . In addition to usual primary care , intervention patients received a decision aid ( a tailored pictographic 10-year fracture risk estimate , absolute risk reduction with bisphosphonates , side effects , and out-of-pocket cost ) , and control patients received a st and ard brochure .  Knowledge transfer , patient involvement in decision-making , and rates of bisphosphonate start and adherence were studied . Data came from medical records , post-visit written and 6-month phone surveys , video recordings of clinical encounters , and pharmacy prescription profiles . RESULTS A total of 100 patients ( range of 10-year fracture risk , 6%-60 % ) were allocated r and omly to receive the decision aid ( n=52 ) or usual care ( n=48 ) . Patients receiving the decision aid were 1.8 times more likely to correctly identify their 10-year fracture risk ( 49 % vs 28 % ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 1.03 - 3.2 ) and 2.7 times more likely to identify their estimated risk reduction with bisphosphonates ( 43 % vs 16 % ; 95 % CI , 1.3 - 5.7 ) . Patient involvement improved with the decision aid by 23 % ( 95 % CI , 13.6 - 31.4 ) .  Bisphosphonates  were started by 44 % of patients receiving the decision aid and 40 % of patients receiving usual care . Adherence at 6 months was similarly high across both groups , but the proportion with more than 80 % adherence was higher with the decision aid ( n=23 [ 100 % ] vs n=14 [ 74 % ] ; P = .009 ) . CONCLUSION A decision aid improved the quality of clinical decisions about bisphosphonate therapy in at-risk postmenopausal women , did not affect start rates , and may have improved adherence', 'OBJECTIVE This r and omized trial was conducted to assess the impact of a mediated decision support intervention on primary care patient prostate cancer screening knowledge , decisional conflict , informed decision making ( IDM ) , and screening . METHODS Before a routine office visit , 313 male patients eligible for prostate cancer screening completed a baseline telephone survey and received a mailed brochure on prostate cancer screening . At the visit , participants were r and omized to either an enhanced intervention ( EI ) or a st and ard intervention ( SI ) group . Before meeting with their physician , EI Group men had a nurse-led \" decision counseling \" session , while SI Group men completed a practice satisfaction survey . An endpoint survey was administered . Survey data , encounter audio-recordings , and chart audit data were used to assess study outcomes . RESULTS Knowledge increased in the EI Group ( mean difference of + 0.8 on a 10-point scale , p=0.001 ) , but decisional conflict did not change ( mean difference of -0.02 on a 4-point scale , p=0.620 ) . The EI Group had higher IDM ( rate ratio=1.30 , p=0.029 ) and lower screening ( odds ratio=0.67 , p=0.102 ) . CONCLUSION Nurse-mediated decision counseling increased participant prostate cancer screening knowledge , and influenced informed decision making and screening . PRACTICE IMPLICATION S Nurses trained in decision counseling can facilitate shared decision making about screening', 'Objective : To test if  TIA/stroke electronic decision support in primary care improves management . Methods : Multicenter , single-blind , parallel-group , cluster r and omized , controlled trial comparing TIA/stroke electronic decision support guided management with usual care . Main outcomes were guideline adherence and 90-day stroke risk . Secondary outcomes were cerebrovascular/vascular/death/adverse events , cost , and user feedback . Main analysis was logistic regression with a normal r and om effect for clusters using a generalized linear mixed model . Results : Twenty-nine clinics were r and omized to intervention , 27 to control , recruiting 172 and 119 eligible patients . More intervention patients received guideline -adherent care ( 131/172 ; 76.2 % ) than control patients ( 49/119 ; 41.2 % ) ( adjusted odds ratio [ OR ] 4.57 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 2.39–8.71 ; p < 0.001 ) . Ninety-day stroke occurred in 2/172 ( 1.2 % ) intervention and 5/119 ( 4.2 % ) control patients ( OR 0.27 ; 95 % CI 0.05–1.41 ; p = 0.098 ) . Ninety-day TIA or stroke occurrence was lower in the intervention group , 4/172 ( 2.3 % ) compared to 10/119 ( 8.5 % ) control ( adjusted OR 0.26 ; 95 % CI 0.70–0.97 ; p = 0.045 ) . Fewer vascular events/deaths occurred in intervention , 6/172 ( 3.5 % ) , than in control patients , 14/119 ( 11.9 % ) ( adjusted OR 0.27 ; 95 % CI 0.09–0.78 ; p = 0.016 ) . Treatment cost ratio of 0.65 ( 95 % CI 0.47–0.91 ; p = 0.013 ) favored the intervention without increased adverse events . Clinician feedback was positive . Conclusion : Primary care use of the TIA/stroke electronic decision support tool  improves guideline adherence , safely reduces treatment cost , achieves positive user feedback , and may reduce cerebrovascular and vascular event risk following TIA/stroke . Classification of evidence : This study provides Class II evidence that a primary care electronic decision support tool improves guideline adherence and might reduce 90-day stroke risk', 'Objective To determine the effectiveness of a patient decision aid ( PDA ) to improve decision quality and glycaemic control in people with diabetes making treatment choices using a cluster r and omised controlled trial ( RCT ) .

Participants General practice s Inclusion criteria : > 4 medical partners ; list size > 7000 ; and a diabetes register with > 1 % of practice population . 191 practice s assessed for eligibility , and 49 practice s r and omised and completed the study . Patients People with type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) taking at least two oral glucose-lowering drugs with maximum tolerated dose with a glycosolated haemoglobin ( HbA1c ) greater than 7.4 % ( IFCC HbA1c > 57 mmol/mol ) or advised in the preceeding 6 months to add or consider changing to insulin therapy . Exclusion criteria : currently using insulin therapy ; difficulty reading or underst and ing English ; difficulty in underst and  ing the purpose of the study ; visual or cognitive impairment or mentally ill . A total of 182 assessed for eligibility , 175 r and omised to 95 intervention and 80 controls , and 167 completion and analysis .  Intervention Brief training of clinicians and use of PDA with patients in single consultation . Primary outcomes Decision quality ( Decisional Conflict Scores , knowledge , realistic expectations and autonomy ) and glycaemic control ( glycosolated haemoglobin , HbA1c ) . Secondary outcomes Knowledge and realistic expectations of the risks and benefits of insulin therapy and diabetic complications . Results Intervention group : lower total Decisional Conflict Scores ( 17.4 vs 25.2 , p<0.001 ) ; better knowledge ( 51.6 % vs 28.8 % , p<0.001 ) ; realistic expectations ( risk of ‘ hypo ’ , ‘ weight gain ’ , ‘ complications ’ ; 81.0 % vs 5.2 % , 70.5 % vs 5.3 % , 26.3 % vs 5.0 % respectively , p<0.001 ) ; and were more autonomous in decision-making ( 64.1 % vs 42.9 % , p=0.012 ) . No significant difference in the glycaemic control between the two groups . Conclusions Use of the P AND As decision aid reduces decisional conflict , improves knowledge , promotes realistic expectations and autonomy in people with diabetes making treatment choices in general practice . IS RCT N Trials Register Number 14842077', 'Background It is estimated that one-third of women will experience abnormal menstrual bleeding . The majority of these cases are not due to cancer or pregnancy complications and , as a result , women are faced with a variety of treatment alternatives , the selection of which is largely dependent on personal preferences for care rather than clinical outcomes . Objective This r and omized trial was design ed to evaluate a preference elicitation tool to promote physician – patient collaborative decision making for treatment of abnormal uterine bleeding ( AUB ) . Methods Adaptive conjoint analysis ( ACA ) was used to create a preference elicitation tool in English and in Spanish . Women with AUB were enrolled to the study and r and omly assigned to ACA or usual counseling at the initial clinic visit at four clinics ( three in Indianapolis , IN , USA , and one in Southern Pines , NC , USA ) . The ACA tool elicited preferences across eight attributes : treatment efficacy ; sexual function ; medical care ; cost ; fertility ; frequency of medication use ; permanence ; and recovery time . t tests were used to compare differences in the primary outcomes of decision regret and treatment satisfaction at the follow-up visit . The study was design ed to have 80 % power to detect significant differences between groups for the primary outcomes of regret and satisfaction . Results Women were enrolled in the study between September 2009 and March 2012 . 183 participants were r and omized to ACA and 191 to usual counseling .  Overall , mean ( st and ard deviation ) treatment satisfaction was high at 35.71 ( 9.72 ) ( scale of 0–44 ) , and decision regret was low at 25.9 ( 21.0 ) ( scale of 0–100 ) , creating ceiling effects for the selected outcome variables ; there were no significant differences between the ACA and control groups at the follow-up assessment . There was a strong inverse relationship between age and decision regret ( p = 0.007 ) . Exploratory subgroup analysis in the youngest quartile comprising 64 women aged 19–35 years showed a statistically non-significant difference in mean regret scores for the ACA group versus usual counseling ( 24.6 vs. 34.6 , respectively ; p = 0.08 ) . Conclusions A preference elicitation tool at the initial consultation visit did not reduce decision regret or improve treatment satisfaction among patients with AUB ; however , there is a need for additional research to further underst and this tool ’s potential role in promoting collaborative decision making , which may be particularly important among younger women', 'Background Percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) and optimal medical therapy ( OMT ) are comparable , alternative therapies for many patients with stable angina ; however , patients may have misconceptions regarding the impact of PCI on risk of death and myocardial infa rct ion ( MI ) in stable coronary artery disease ( CAD ) . Methods and Results We design ed and developed a patient-centered decision aid ( PCI Choice ) to promote shared decision making for patients with stable CAD . The estimated benefits and risks of PCI+OMT as compared to OMT were displayed in a decision aid using pictographs with natural frequencies and text . We engaged patients , clinicians , health service research ers , and design ers with over 20 successive iterations of the decision aid , which were field tested during real-world clinical encounters involving clinicians and patients . The decision aid is intended to facilitate knowledge transfer , deliberation based on patient values and preferences , and shared decision making . Conclusions We describe the methods and outcomes of the design and development of a decision aid ( PCI Choice ) to promote shared decision making between clinicians and patients regarding the choice of PCI+OMT vs. OMT for treatment of stable CAD . We will evaluate the impact of PCI Choice on patient knowledge , decisional conflict , participation in decision-making , and treatment choice in an upcoming r and omized trial', 'This study examines the effect of a shared decision-making intervention ( SDMI ) on patients ’ and clinicians ’ self-perceived interpersonal behavior . Clinicians ( n = 34 ) in three addiction treatment centers in the Netherl and s were r and omly assigned to SDMI or treatment decision-making as usual .  Patients receiving inpatient treatment in 2005–2006 were included ( n = 212 ) . Baseline characteristics were measured by the European Addiction Severity Index ( EuropASI ) and the Composite International Diagnostic Interview — Substance Abuse Module ( CIDI-SAM ) . Treatment goals were assessed using the Goals of Treatment Question naire ( GoT-Q ) plus a Q-sort ranking procedure . Interpersonal behavior was measured by Interpersonal Checklist — Revised ( ICL-R ) at baseline , end of treatment , and 3-month follow-up . Repeated measures analyses of variance and multiple hierarchical linear regression analysis were used . The key finding of this study was that SDMI is associated with an increase of patient autonomy ( independent behavior ) and control behavior . The study limitations have been noted', 'OBJECTIVES The objective of this r and omized , controlled study was to determine the usefulness of a decision aid on pre-donation of autologous blood before elective open heart surgery . METHODS The decision aid ( DA ) group received a tape and booklet which described the options for peri-operative transfusion in detail . The no decision aid ( NDA ) group received information usually given to patients about autologous donation . RESULTS A total of 120 patients were r and omized . The DA group rated themselves better prepared for decision making and showed significant improvements in knowledge ( p = 0.001 ) and realistic risk perceptions ( p = 0.001 ) . In both groups there was an increase in the proportion of patients choosing allogeneic blood between baseline and follow-up ( p = 0.001 ) . Patients in the DA group were significantly more satisfied with the amount of information they received , how they were treated and with the decision they made , than patients in the NDA group . CONCLUSION The decision aid is useful in preparing patients for decision making . PRACTICE IMPLICATION S The next stage is to explore strategies to make it available to all appropriate patients', 'Prenatal diagnosis ( PND ) is offered routinely as part of pregnancy care to a large number of women at increased risk of fetal anomalies . Despite an extraordinary growth in the use of PND and significant re source allocation , few studies have examined outcomes of PND counseling , and virtually no research has evaluated the relative efficacy of various approaches to genetic counseling . This study was a r and omized trial that compared which counseling methods – individual , group , and use of a decision aid – are effective in PND counseling for women of advanced maternal age ( ≥35 years ) and their partners . Three hundred and fifty‐two women and 225 partners completed pre‐ and post‐intervention question naires assessing changes in knowledge , decisional conflict , state anxiety , satisfaction , use of PND , and pregnancy outcomes . All participants showed a significant increase in knowledge and a decrease in decisional conflict post intervention . Those in the group intervention showed a significantly greater increase in knowledge than those in the individual counseling intervention . While high levels of satisfaction were reported by all , those in individual counseling were significantly more satisfied than those receiving group counseling or the decision aid . This study has shown unique benefits with each type of intervention such that women and their partners preferred individual genetic counseling , while they learned best in group‐counseling sessions , and experienced the least decisional conflict regarding genetic testing with a decision aid', \"Abstract Objective : To compare the effectiveness of touch screen system with information leaflet for providing women with information on prenatal tests . Design : R and omised controlled trial ; participants allocated to intervention group ( given access to touch screen and leaflet information ) or control group ( leaflet information only ) . Setting : Antenatal clinic in university teaching hospital . Subjects : 875 women booking antenatal care . Interventions : All participants received a leaflet providing information on prenatal tests . Women in the intervention arm also had access to touch screen information system in antenatal clinic . Main outcome measures : Women 's informed decision making on prenatal testing as measured by their uptake of and underst and ing of the purpose of specific tests ; their satisfaction with information provided ; and their levels of anxiety . Results : All women in the trial had a good baseline knowledge of prenatal tests . Women in the intervention group did not show any greater underst and ing of the purpose of the tests than control women . However , uptake of detailed anomaly scans was significantly higher in intervention group than the control group ( 94 % ( 351/375 ) v 87 % ( 310/358 ) , P=0.0014 ) . Levels of anxiety among nulliparous women in intervention group declined significantly over time ( P<0.001 ) . Conclusions : The touch screen seemed to convey no benefit over well prepared leaflets in improving underst and ing of prenatal tests among the pregnant women . It did , however , seem to reduce levels of anxiety and may be most effective for providing information to selected women who have a relevant adverse history or abnormal results from tests in their current pregnancy\", \"The objective was to evaluate the effect of an assessment strategy using the computer decision support system ( the GRAIDS software ) , on the management of familial cancer risk in British general practice in comparison with best current practice . The design included cluster r and omised controlled trial , and involved forty-five general practice teams in East Anglia , UK . R and omised to GRAIDS ( Genetic Risk Assessment on the Internet with Decision Support ) support ( intervention n=23 ) or comparison ( n=22 ) . Training in the new assessment strategy and access to the GRAIDS software ( GRAIDS arm ) was conducted , compared with an educational session and guidelines about managing familial breast and colorectal cancer risk ( comparison ) were mailed . Outcomes were measured at practice , practitioner and patient levels . The primary outcome measure , at practice level , was the proportion of referrals made to the Regional Genetics Clinic for familial breast or colorectal cancer that were consistent with referral guidelines . Other measures included practitioner confidence in managing familial cancer ( GRAIDS arm only ) and , in patients : cancer worry , risk perception and knowledge about familial cancer . There were more referrals to the Regional Genetics Clinic from GRAIDS than comparison practice s ( mean 6.2 and 3.2 referrals per 10 000 registered patients per year ; mean difference 3.0 referrals ; 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 1.2–4.8 ; P=0.001 ) ; referrals from GRAIDS practice s were more likely to be consistent with referral guidelines ( odds ratio (OR)=5.2 ; 95 % CI 1.7–15.8 , P=0.006 ) . Patients referred from GRAIDS practice s had lower cancer worry scores at the point of referral ( mean difference −1.44 95 % CI −2.64 to −0.23 , P=0.02 ) . There were no differences in patient knowledge about familial cancer . The intervention increased GPs ' confidence in managing familial cancer . Compared with education and mailed guidelines , assessment including computer decision support increased the number and quality of referrals to the Regional Genetics Clinic for familial cancer risk , improved practitioner confidence and had no adverse psychological effects in patients . Trials are registered under N0181144343 in the UK National Research Register\", 'Background . Statin Choice is a decision aid about taking statins . The optimal mode of delivering Statin Choice ( or any other decision aid ) in clinical practice is unknown . Methods . To investigate the effect of mode of delivery on decision aid efficacy , the authors further explored the results of a concealed 2 × 2 factorial clustered r and omized trial enrolling 21 endocrinologists and 98 diabetes patients and r and omizing them to 1 ) receive either the decision aid or pamphlet about cholesterol , and 2 ) have these delivered either during the office visit ( by the clinician ) or before the visit ( by a research er ) . We estimated between-group differences and their 95 % confidence intervals ( CI ) for acceptability of information delivery ( 1—7 ) , knowledge about statins and coronary risk ( 0—9 ) , and decisional conflict about statin use ( 0—100 ) assessed immediately after the visit . Follow-up was 99 % . Results . The relative efficacy of the decision aid v. pamphlet interacted with the mode of delivery . Compared with the pamphlet , patients whose clinicians delivered the decision aid during the office visit showed significant improvements in knowledge ( difference of 1.6 of 9 questions , CI 0.3 , 2.8 ) and nonsignificant trends toward finding the decision aid more acceptable ( odds ratio 3.1 , CI 0.9 , 11.2 ) and having less decisional conflict ( difference of 7 of 100 points , CI -4 , 18 ) than when a research er delivered the decision aid just before the office visit . Conclusions . Delivery of decision aids by clinicians during the visit improves knowledge and shows a trend toward better acceptability and less decisional conflict', \"BACKGROUND Current guidelines recommend global risk assessment to guide vascular risk factor management ; however , most provider-patient communication focuses on individual risk factors in isolation . We sought to evaluate the impact of personalized coronary heart disease and stroke risk communication on patients ' knowledge , beliefs , and health behavior . METHODS We conducted a r and omized controlled trial testing personalized risk communication based on Framingham stroke and coronary heart disease risk scores compared with a st and ard risk factor education . A total of 89 patients were recruited from primary care clinics and followed up for 3 months . Outcomes included the following : risk perception and worry , risk factor knowledge , risk reduction preferences and decision conflict , medication adherence , health behaviors , and blood pressure . RESULTS Participants had a very low underst and ing of numeric information , high perceived risk for stroke or myocardial infa rct ion , and high proportion of medication nonadherence . Patients ' ability to identify vascular risk factors increased with personalized risk communication ( mean 1.8 additional risk factors , 95 % CI 1.3 - 2.2 ) and st and ard risk factor education ( mean 1.6 additional risk factors , 95 % CI 1.1 - 2.1 ) immediately after the intervention but was not sustained at 3 months . Patients in the personalized group had less decision conflict than the st and ard risk factor education group over intended risk reduction strategies ( 5.9 vs 10.1 , P = .003 ) . There was no appreciable impact of either communication strategy on medication adherence , exercise , smoking cessation , or blood pressure . CONCLUSIONS Personalized risk communication was preferred by patients and had a small impact on risk reduction preferences and decision conflict but had no impact on patient beliefs or behavior compared with st and ard risk factor education\", \"Abstract Objective : To determine whether a decision aid on benign prostatic hypertrophy influences decision making , health outcomes , and re source use . Design : R and omised controlled trial . Setting : 33 general practice s in the United Kingdom . Participants : 112 men with benign prostatic hypertrophy . Intervention : Patients ' decision aid consisting of an interactive multimedia programme with booklet and printed summary . Outcome measures : Patients ' and general practitioners ' perceptions of who made the decision , decisional conflict scores , treatment choice and prostatectomy rate , American Urological Association symptom scale , costs , anxiety , utility , and general health status . Results : Both patients and general practitioners found the decision aid acceptable . A higher proportion of patients ( 32 % v 4 % ; mean difference 28 % , 95 % confidence interval 14 % to 41 % ) and their general practitioners ( 46 % v 25 % ; 21 % , 3 % to 40 % ) perceived that treatment decisions had been made mainly or only by patients in the intervention group compared with the control group . Patients in the intervention group had significantly lower decisional conflict scores than those in the control group at three months ( 2.3 v 2.6 ; −0.3 , −0.5 to −0.1 , P<0.01 ) and this was maintained at nine months . No differences were found between the groups for anxiety , general health status , prostatic symptoms , utility , or costs ( excluding costs associated with the video disc equipment ) . Conclusions : The decision aid reduced decisional conflict in men with benign prostatic hypertrophy , and the patients played a more active part in decision making . Such programmes could be delivered cheaply by the internet , and there are good arguments for coordinated investment in them , particularly for conditions in which patient utilities are important . What is already known on this topic Patients want more information about their condition and treatment options , and many want to play an active part in decision making Decision aids improve patients ' knowledge of their conditions and treatment options What this study adds The decision aid was highly acceptable to both the patients and their general practitioners Decisional conflict was reduced in the intervention group Patients who viewed the programme played a more active part in the decision making process and were less anxious than control patients Such aids could be introduced throughout the NHS at relatively low cost by using the\", 'BACKGROUND Shared decision making ( SDM ) is a widely recommended yet unproven strategy for increasing colorectal cancer ( CRC ) screening uptake . Previous trials of decision aids to increase SDM and CRC screening uptake have yielded mixed results . PURPOSE To assess the impact of decision aid-assisted SDM on CRC screening uptake . DESIGN RCT . SETTING / PARTICIPANTS The study was conducted at an urban , academic safety-net hospital and community health center between 2005 and 2010 . Participants were asymptomatic , average-risk patients aged 50 - 75 years due for CRC screening . INTERVENTION Study participants ( n=825 ) were r and omized to one of two intervention arms ( decision aid plus personalized risk assessment or decision aid alone ) or control arm . The interventions took place just prior to a routine office visit with their primary care providers . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome was completion of a CRC screening test within 12 months of the study visit . Logistic regression was used to identify predictors of test completion and mediators of the intervention effect . Analysis was completed in 2011 . RESULTS Patients in the decision-aid group were more likely to complete a screening test than control patients ( 43.1 % vs 34.8 % , p=0.046 ) within 12 months of the study visit ; conversely , test uptake for the decision aid and decision aid plus personalized risk assessment arms was similar ( 43.1 % vs 37.1 % , p=0.15 ) . Assignment to the decision-aid arm ( AOR=1.48 , 95 % CI=1.04 , 2.10 ) , black race ( AOR=1.52 , 95 % CI=1.12 , 2.06 ) and a preference for a patient-dominant decision-making approach ( AOR=1.55 , 95 % CI=1.02 , 2.35 ) were independent determinants of test completion . Activation of the screening discussion and enhanced screening intentions mediated the intervention effect . CONCLUSIONS Decision aid-assisted SDM has a modest impact on CRC screening uptake . A decision aid plus personalized risk assessment tool is no more effective than a decision aid alone . TRIAL REGISTRATION This study is registered at www . clinical trials.govNCT00251862', \"OBJECTIVES (1)To compare an interactive multimedia decision aid ( IMDA ) with a leaflet and a video to give information about prenatal screening for Down syndrome and ( 2 ) to determine the women 's acceptance of IMDA . METHODS Two hundred and one women were recruited from the prenatal clinic of a university teaching hospital and r and omised into the intervention group ( IMDA , video , and information leaflet ) or the control group ( video and information leaflet ) . RESULTS There were no significant differences in the initial decision for and the final uptake of the prenatal screening test between the control and intervention groups . The proportion of women who were undecided was less than 10 % in both groups . Of the women in the intervention group , 86.6 % and 78.9 % agreed that IMDA was user-friendly and acceptable , respectively . Significantly more women aged < 35 ( 88.1 % ) accepted IMDA than women aged > or = 35 ( 68.3 % ) ( P = 0.030 ) , but the logistic regression analysis did not confirm this finding after adjusting for other factors ( computer knowledge and usage of computer ) . CONCLUSION The use of IMDA did not affect the women 's overall uptake rate of the prenatal screening test for Down syndrome . More women less than 35 years accepted IMDA probably because they used computer more frequently and had more computer knowledge\", 'OBJECTIVE To assess whether providing customized clinical information to patients and physicians  improves safety or quality of diabetes care . RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Study subjects included 123 primary care physicians and 3,703 eligible adult diabetic patients with elevated A1C or LDL cholesterol , who were r and omly assigned to receive customized feedback of clinical information as follows : 1 ) patient only , 2 ) physician only , 3 ) both the patient and physician , or 4 ) neither patient nor physician . In the intervention groups , patients received customized mailed information or physicians received printed , prioritized lists of patients with recommended clinical actions and performance feedback . Hierarchical models were used to accommo date group r and om assignment . RESULTS Study interventions did not improve A1C test ordering ( P = 0.35 ) and negatively affected LDL cholesterol test ordering ( P < 0.001 ) in the 12 months postintervention . Interventions had no effect on LDL cholesterol values ( P = 0.64 ) , which improved in all groups over time . Interventions had a borderline unfavorable effect on A1C values among those with baseline A1C ≥7 % ( P = 0.10 ) and an unfavorable effect on A1C values among those with baseline A1C ≥8 % ( P < 0.01 ) . Interventions did not reduce risky prescribing events or increase treatment intensification . Time to next visit was longer in all intervention groups compared with that for the control group ( P < 0.05 ) . CONCLUSIONS Providing customized decision support to physicians and /or patients did not improve quality or safety of diabetes care and worsened A1C control in patients with baseline A1C ≥8 % . Future research ers should consider providing point-of-care decision support with re design of office systems and /or incentives to increase appropriate actions in response to decision-support information', \"BACKGROUND Influenza immunization for healthcare personnel reduces frequency and severity of nosocomial influenza outbreaks and influenza-associated morbidity and mortality among patients . The Ottawa Influenza Decision Aid ( OIDA ) was developed to assist undecided healthcare workers in deciding whether or not to be immunized . AIM To assess the impact of the OIDA , and to ascertain whether its use would increase the level of confidence in healthcare workers ' influenza immunization decision and positively affect their intent to be immunized . METHODS Single-centre , single-blind , parallel-group , r and omized controlled trial . FINDINGS Eight per cent ( 151 of 1886 ) of the unimmunized healthcare personnel were r and omized . Of 107 eligible respondents , 48 were in the Ottawa Influenza Decision Aid ( OIDA ) group and 59 in the control group .  A statistically significant ( P = 0.020 ) greater improvement in confidence in immunization decision was observed in the OIDA group compared with the control group . Whereas the odds of changing intent to be immunized from ' no/unsure ' to ' yes ' was 2.4 times greater in the OIDA group , this result did not reach statistical significance after adjusting for intent to be immunized at baseline . The post-OIDA intent to be immunized in the OIDA and control groups compared to the pre-OIDA intent to be immunized showed that the OIDA had a significant effect on reducing uncertainty ( P = 0.035 ) . CONCLUSIONS Using an accessible , balanced , underst and able format for all healthcare personnel about their influenza immunization decision appears to have an impact on both healthcare personnel 's confidence in their immunization decision and in their intent to be immunized\", 'Background . This investigation examined factors affecting  patient involvement in consultations to decide local treatment for early breast cancer and the effectiveness of two methods of preconsultation education aim ed at increasing patient participation in these discussion', 'Background : The SIMS-Trial showed that the ‘ Sapere Migliora ’ information aid ( IA ) for newly diagnosed people with multiple sclerosis ( PwMS ) effectively improved patient knowledge and satisfaction with care . Objectives : The objectives of this paper are to assess the effectiveness of the IA in clinical practice and to compare the whole IA with the take-home booklet/website component alone . Methods : After updating the IA and replacing the CD with a website , a prospect i ve , open-label non-r and omised controlled trial compared the whole IA ( group A , five SIMS-Trial centres ) to take-home ( group B , 16 centres ) . One month after the intervention , participants completed the  MS Knowledge Question naire ( MSKQ ) , care satisfaction question naire ( COSM-R ) ( primary study outcomes ) , Hospital and Anxiety Depression Scale , and ad hoc question naire appraising the IA . Results : We enrolled 159 newly diagnosed PwMS ( May 2012–March 2013 ) . Drop-outs were four of 77 ( 5 % , group A ) and 11/82 ( 13 % , group B ) . Primary endpoint ( highest tertile both for MSKQ and COSM-R section 2 scores ) was achieved by 38/77 ( 49 % ) group A and 33/82 ( 40 % ) group B ( p = 0.25 ) . Attainment of secondary outcomes was also similar between groups .

OUTCOME : Perceived clarity of values , a sub-scale of the decisional conflict scale ; congruence between personal values of benefits and risks ( measured on 0 - 10 importance rating scale ) and choices ( accept , decline , unsure regarding preventive hormone therapy [ HRT ] ) using discriminant function analysis . RESULTS : There were no statistically significant differences between interventions in perceived clarity of values and overall congruence between values and choices . Amongst those choosing HRT , there was a trend in those exposed to the graphic weigh-scale exercise to have better congruence between values and choices compared to implicit values clarification ( P = 0.06 ) . CONCLUSION : The use of the graphic weigh-scale exercise in a decision aid conveys no overall short-term benefit . Further study is needed to specifically determine effects in those changing the status quo and on the quality of patient-practitioner communication and persistence with decisions\", \"Background : Until there is a definitive demonstration that early diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer reduces disease-related mortality , it is imperative to promote informed screening decisions by providing balanced information about the potential benefits and risks of prostate cancer screening . Within a community/academic collaboration , we conducted a r and omized trial of a printed booklet and a videotape that were design ed for African American ( AA ) men . The purpose of the trial was to determine the effect of the interventions on knowledge , decisional conflict , satisfaction with the screening decision , and self-reported screening . Methods : Participants were 238 AA men , ages 40 to 70 years , who were members of the Prince Hall Masons in Washington , DC . Men were r and omly assigned to the ( a ) video-based information study arm , ( b ) print-based information study arm , or ( c ) wait list control study arm . Intervention material s were mailed to men at home . Assessment s were conducted at baseline , 1 month , and 12 months postintervention . Multivariate analyses , including ANCOVA and logistic regression , were used to analyze group differences . Results : The booklet and video result ed in a significant improvement in knowledge and a reduction in decisional conflict about prostate cancer screening , relative to the wait list control . Satisfaction with the screening decision was not affected by the interventions . Self-reported screening rates increased between the baseline and the 1-year assessment , although screening was not differentially associated with either of the interventions . In exploratory analyses , prostate-specific antigen testing at 1 year was more likely among previously screened men and was associated with having low baseline decisional conflict . Conclusions : This study represents one of the first r and omized intervention trials specifically design ed to address AA men 's informed decision making about prostate cancer screening . We have developed and evaluated culturally sensitive , balanced , and disseminable material s that improved knowledge and reduced decisional conflict about prostate cancer screening among AA men . Due to the high incidence and mortality rates among AA men , there is a need for targeted educational material s , particularly material s that are balanced in terms of the benefits and risks of screening . ( Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev 2006;15(11):2179–88\", 'Objective To compare the effect of an invitation promoting informed choice for screening with a st and ard invitation on attendance and motivation to engage in preventive action . Design R and omised controlled trial . Setting Four English general practice s. Participants 1272 people aged 40 - 69 years , at risk for diabetes , identified from practice registers using a vali date d risk score and invited to attend for screening . Intervention Intervention was a previously vali date d invitation to inform the decision to attend screening , presenting diabetes as a serious potential problem , and providing details of possible costs and benefits of screening and treatment in text and pie charts . This was compared with a brief , st and ard invitation simply describing diabetes as a serious potential problem . Main outcome measures The primary end point was attendance for screening . The secondary outcome measures were intention to make changes to lifestyle and satisfaction with decisions made among attenders . Results The primary end point was analysed for all 1272 participants . 55.8 % ( 353/633 ) of those in the informed choice group attended for screening , compared with 57.6 % ( 368/639 ) in the st and ard invitation group ( mean difference −1.8 % , 95 % confidence interval −7.3 % to 3.6 % ; P=0.51 ) . Attendance was lower among the more deprived group ( most deprived third 47.5 % v least deprived third 64.3 % ; P<0.001 ) . Interaction between deprivation and effect of invitation type on attendance was not significant . Among attenders , intention to change behaviour was strong and unaffected by invitation type . Conclusions Providing information to support choice did not adversely affect attendance for screening for diabetes . Those from more socially deprived groups were , however , less likely to attend , regardless of the type of invitation received . Further attention to invitation content alone is unlikely to achieve equity in uptake of preventive services . Trial registration Current Controlled Trials IS RCT N 73125647', 'BACKGROUND In recent years , patients have indicated a desire for more information about their disease and to be involved in making decisions about their care . We developed an aid called the \" Decision Board \" to help clinicians inform patients with lymph node-negative breast cancer of the risks and benefits of adjuvant chemotherapy . We determined whether adding the Decision Board to the medical consultation improved patient knowledge and satisfaction compared with the medical consultation alone . METHODS Between October 1995 and March 2000 , 176 women with lymph node-negative breast cancer who were c and i date s for adjuvant chemotherapy were r and omly assigned to receive the Decision Board plus the medical consultation ( 83 patients ) or the medical consultation alone ( 93 patients ) . One week after the consultation , patients completed a question naire assessing their knowledge about breast cancer and chemotherapy .  Satisfaction with decision making was assessed 1 week and 3 , 6 , and 12 months after r and omization , and differences between groups were analyzed by a repeated measures analysis of variance . All statistical tests were two-sided . RESULTS Patients in the Decision Board arm were better informed about breast cancer and adjuvant chemotherapy than patients in the control arm ( mean knowledge score = 80.2 [ on a scale of 0 - 100 ] , 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] = 77.1 to 83.3 , and 71.7 , 95 % CI = 69.0 to 74.4 , respectively ; P<.001 ) . Over the entire study period , satisfaction with decision making was higher for patients in the Decision Board arm than for patients in the control arm ( P = .032 ) . There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in the number of patients who chose adjuvant chemotherapy ( 77 % and 70 % for patients in the Decision Board arm and those in the control arm , respectively ; P = .303 ) . CONCLUSION When making decisions regarding adjuvant chemotherapy , patients with early breast cancer who had been exposed to the Decision Board had better knowledge of the disease and treatment options and greater satisfaction with their decision making than those who received the st and ard consultation', 'Purpose Osteoporosis Choice , an encounter decision aid , can engage patients and clinicians in shared decision making about osteoporosis treatment . Its effectiveness compared to the routine provision to clinicians of the patient ’s estimated risk of fracture using the FRAX calculator is unknown . Methods Patient-level , r and omized , three-arm trial enrolling women over 50 with osteopenia or osteoporosis eligible for treatment with bisphosphonates  , where the use of Osteoporosis Choice was compared to FRAX only and to usual care to determine impact on patient knowledge , decisional conflict , involvement in the decision-making process , decision to start and adherence to bisphosphonates . Results We enrolled 79 women in the three arms . Because FRAX estimation alone and usual care produced similar results , we grouped them for analysis . Compared to these , use of Osteoporosis Choice increased patient knowledge ( median score 6 vs. 4 , p = .01 ) , improved underst and ing of fracture risk and risk reduction with bisphosphonates  ( p = .01 and p<.0001 , respectively ) , had no effect on decision conflict , and increased patient engagement in the decision making process ( OPTION scores 57 % vs. 43 % , p = .001 ) . Encounters with the decision aid were 0.8 minutes longer ( range : 33 minutes shorter to 3.0 minutes longer ) . There were twice as many patients receiving and filling prescriptions in the decision aid arm ( 83 % vs. 40 % , p = .07 ) ; medication adherence at 6 months was no different across arms . Conclusion Supporting both patients and clinicians during the clinical encounter with the Osteoporosis Choice decision aid efficiently improves treatment decision making when compared to usual care with or without clinical decision support with FRAX results . Trial Registration clinical trials.gov', 'Background Decision aids can improve decision making processes , but the amount and type of information that they should attempt to communicate is controversial . We sought to compare , in a pilot r and omized trial , two colorectal cancer ( CRC )  screening decision aids that differed in the number of screening options presented . Methods Adults ages 48–75 not currently up to date with screening were recruited from the community and r and omized to view one of two versions of our previously tested CRC screening decision aid . The first version included five screening options : fecal occult blood test ( FOBT ) , sigmoidoscopy , a combination of FOBT and sigmoidoscopy , colonoscopy , and barium enema . The second discussed only the two most frequently selected screening options , FOBT and colonoscopy . Main outcomes were differences in screening interest and test preferences between groups after decision aid viewing . Patient test preference was elicited first without any associated out-of-pocket costs ( OPC ) , and then with the following costs : FOBT-$10 , sigmoidoscopy-$50 , barium enema-$50 , and colonoscopy-$200 . Results 62 adults participated : 25 viewed the 5-option decision aid , and 37 viewed the 2-option  version . Mean age was 54 ( range 48–72 ) , 58 % were women , 71 % were White , 24 % African-American ; 58 % had completed at least a 4-year college degree . Comparing participants that viewed the 5-option version with participants who viewed the 2-option version , there were no differences in screening interest after viewing ( 1.8 vs. 1.9 , t-test p = 0.76 ) . Those viewing the 2-option version were somewhat more likely to choose colonoscopy than those viewing the 5-option version when no out of pocket costs were assumed ( 68 % vs. 46 % , p = 0.11 ) , but not when such costs were imposed ( 41 % vs. 42 % , p = 1.00 ) . Conclusion The number of screening options available does not appear to have a large effect on interest in colorectal cancer screening . The effect of offering differing numbers of options may affect test choice when out-of-pocket costs are not considered', \"Background — Vascular access options in coronary angiography can be considered a preference-sensitive decision , where the benefits /risks have different levels of significance , depending on the individual patient . For preference-sensitive healthcare options , patient decision aids ( PtDA ) significantly improve the process of decision-making . The purpose of this trial was to evaluate the effectiveness of an evidence -based PtDA compared with usual care in patients eligible for radial and femoral artery access . Methods and Results — We conducted a single-center , nonblinded , r and omized controlled trial with patients eligible for both femoral and radial access as per their treating physician . The PtDA was design ed to guide patients to make an informed choice , consistent with their preferences and values . The primary outcome , decisional conflict , was assessed using the vali date d decisional conflict scale .  One hundred fifty patients were r and omized ( vascular access PtDA=76 versus usual care=74 ) . The intervention group had a significantly reduced decisional conflict scale compared with control ( unadjusted 14.8 versus 19.5 , P=0.04 ) and were significantly more knowledgeable regarding risks/ benefits associated with each vascular access ( mean knowledge score 3/5 ( 95 % confidence interval , 2.6 to 3.3 ) versus 2/5 ( 95 % confidence interval , 1.7 to 2.3 , P<0.01 ) . PtDA patients had better informed value congruence with their vascular access received ( 47.3 % versus 25.7 % , P<0.01 ) . There were no significant differences in procedural success or safety between the 2 groups . Conclusions — A vascular access PtDA for eligible patients undergoing coronary angiogram procedures reduces decisional conflict and improves value congruence and the patients ' knowledge of their healthcare options ; however , a multicenter study , powered to confirm these benefits and evaluate differences in procedural success or complications , is required .

Unique identifier : NCT01032551\", 'Background Mental health policy makers encourage the development of electronic decision aids to increase patient participation in medical decision making . Evidence is needed to determine whether these decision aids are helpful in clinical practice and whether they lead to increased patient involvement and better outcomes . Objective This study reports the outcome of a r and omized controlled trial and process evaluation of a Web-based intervention to facilitate shared decision making for people with psychotic disorders . Methods The study was carried out in a Dutch mental health institution . Patients were recruited from 2 outpatient teams for patients with psychosis ( N=250 ) . Patients in the intervention condition ( n=124 ) were provided an account to access a Web-based information and decision tool aim ed to support patients in acquiring an overview of their needs and appropriate treatment options provided by their mental health care organization . Patients were given the opportunity to use the Web-based tool either on their own ( at their home computer or at a computer of the service ) or with the support of an assistant . Patients in the control group received care as usual ( n=126 ) . Half of the patients in the sample were patients experiencing a first episode of psychosis ; the other half were patients with a chronic psychosis . Primary outcome was patient-perceived involvement in medical decision making , measured with the Combined Outcome Measure for Risk Communication and Treatment Decision-making Effectiveness ( COMRADE ) . Process evaluation consisted of question naire-based surveys , open interviews , and research er observation . Results In all , 73 patients completed the follow-up measurement and were included in the final analysis ( response rate 29.2 % ) . More than one-third ( 48/124 , 38.7 % ) of the patients who were provided access to the Web-based decision aid used it , and most used its full functionality . No differences were found between the intervention and control conditions on perceived involvement in medical decision making ( COMRADE satisfaction with communication : F1,68=0.422 , P=.52 ; COMRADE confidence in decision : F1,67=0.086 , P=.77 ) . In addition , results of the process evaluation suggest that the intervention did not optimally fit in with routine practice of the participating teams . Conclusions The development of electronic decision aids to facilitate shared medical decision making is encouraged and many people with a psychotic disorder can work with them . This holds for both first-episode patients and long-term care patients , although the latter group might need more assistance . However , results of this paper could not support the assumption that the use of electronic decision aids increases patient involvement in medical decision making . This may be because of weak implementation of the study protocol and a low response rate .

A substantial proportion of treated hypertensive patients do not reach recommended target blood pressure values . Shared decision making ( SDM ) is to enhance the active role of patients . As until now there exists little information on the effects of SDM training in antihypertensive therapy , we tested the effect of an SDM training programme for general practitioners ( GPs ) . Our hypotheses are that this SDM training ( 1 ) enhances the participation of patients and ( 2 ) leads to an enhanced decrease in blood pressure ( BP ) values , compared to patients receiving usual care without prior SDM training for GPs . Methods The study was conducted as a cluster r and omised controlled trial ( c RCT ) with GP practice s in Southwest Germany . Each GP practice included patients with treated but uncontrolled hypertension and /or with relevant comorbidity . After baseline assessment ( T0 ) GP practice s were r and omly allocated into an intervention and a control arm . GPs of the intervention group took part in the SDM training . GPs of the control group treated their patients as usual . The intervention was blinded to the patients . Primary endpoints on patient level were ( 1 ) change of patients ’ perceived participation ( SDM-Q-9 ) and ( 2 ) change of systolic BP ( 24h-mean ) . Secondary endpoints were changes of ( 1 ) diastolic BP ( 24h-mean ) , ( 2 ) patients ’ knowledge about hypertension , ( 3 ) adherence ( MARS-D ) , and ( 4 ) cardiovascular risk score ( CVR ) . Results In total 1357 patients from 36 general practice s were screened for blood pressure control by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring ( ABPM ) . Thereof 1120 patients remained in the study because of uncontrolled ( but treated ) hypertension and /or a relevant comorbidity . At T0 the intervention group involved 17 GP practice s with 552 patients and the  control group 19 GP practice s with 568 patients . The effectiveness analysis could not demonstrate a significant or relevant effect of the SDM training on any of the endpoints . Conclusion The study hypothesis that the SDM training enhanced patients ’ perceived participation and lowered their BP could not be confirmed . Further research is needed to examine the impact of patient participation on the treatment of hypertension in primary care . Trial registration German Clinical Trials Register ( DRKS ) :', \"BACKGROUND Mixed method research , the combined use of qualitative and quantitative methods , is increasingly popular in health services research , especially as a way to examine ' complex interventions ' . This paper seeks to provide a case example of the use of mixed methods in the analysis of a complex intervention ( a computerized interactive decision aid ) to test whether their use affords insights into potential moderators of the intervention ( i.e. patient factors that were associated with the impact of the intervention ) . METHODS We conducted a pragmatic r and omized controlled trial ( n=149 ) of a decision aid in women attending their primary care practitioners with menorrhagia . Alongside the trial , a qualitative study was conducted with interviews with a sample of women who had received the intervention ( n=18 ) . Hypotheses generated by the qualitative study were used to inform subsequent quantitative subgroup analyses . RESULTS The results from both studies showed that the decision aid was broadly beneficial . The qualitative study found that women with less formal education reported greater levels of benefit from the intervention . However , quantitative analyses of formal education as a moderator of treatment effect found that the intervention provided the greatest benefit in women with greater formal education . The findings of the qualitative and quantitative studies thus demonstrated a significant inter- method discrepancy . Possible reasons for this discrepancy are discussed . CONCLUSIONS Mixed methods can illuminate different aspects of an intervention or provide greater insight into particular issues . Health service research ers need to be aware that the qualitative and quantitative results may be discrepant , and methods need to be developed to deal with such discrepancies . However , exploring seemingly discrepant results can lead to greater insight and the development of new hypotheses and avenues of research\", 'Background Early detection of melanoma improves survival . Since many melanoma patients and their spouses seek the care of a physician after discovering their melanoma , an ongoing study will determine the efficacy of teaching at-risk melanoma patients and their skin check partner how to conduct skin self-examinations ( SSEs ) . Internet-based health behavior interventions have proven efficacious in creating behavior change in patients to better prevent , detect , or cope with their health issues . The efficacy of electronic interactive SSE educational intervention provided on a tablet device has not previously been determined . Objective The electronic interactive educational intervention was created to develop a scalable , effective intervention to enhance performance and accuracy of SSE among those at-risk to develop melanoma . The intervention in the office was conducted using one of the following three methods : ( 1 ) in-person through a facilitator , ( 2 ) with a paper workbook , or ( 3 ) with a tablet device used in the clinical office . Differences related to method of delivery were eluci date d by having the melanoma patient and their skin check partner provide a self-report of their confidence in performing SSE and take a knowledge-based test immediately after receiving the intervention . Methods The three interventions used 9 of the 26 behavioral change techniques defined by Abraham and Michie to promote planning of monthly SSE , encourage performing SSE , and reinforce self-efficacy by praising correct responses to knowledge-based decision making and offering helpful suggestions to improve performance . In creating the electronic interactive SSE educational intervention , the educational content was taken directly from both the scripted in-person presentation delivered with Microsoft PowerPoint by a trained facilitator and the paper workbook training arms of the study . Enrollment totaled 500 pairs ( melanoma patient and their SSE partner ) with r and omization of 165 pairs to the in-person , 165 pairs to the workbook , and 70 pairs to electronic interactive SSE educational intervention . Results The demographic survey data showed no significant mean differences between groups in age , education , or income . The tablet usability survey given to the first 30 tablet pairs found that , overall , participants found the electronic interactive intervention easy to use and that the video of the doctor-patient-partner dialogue accompanying the dermatologist ’s examination was particularly helpful in underst and ing what they were asked to do for the study . The interactive group proved to be just as good as the workbook group in self-confidence of scoring moles , and just as good as both the workbook and the in-person intervention groups in self-confidence of monitoring their moles . While the in-person intervention performed significantly better on a skill-based quiz , the electronic interactive group performed significantly better than the workbook group . The electronic interactive and in-person interventions were more efficient ( 30 minutes ) , while the workbook took longer ( 45 minutes ) . Conclusions This study suggests that an electronic interactive intervention can deliver skills training comparable to other training methods , and the experience can be accommo date d during the customary outpatient office visit with the physician . Further testing of the electronic interactive intervention ’s role in the anxiety of the pair and pair-discovered melanomas upon self-screening will eluci date the impact of these tools on outcomes in at-risk patient population s.

DESIGN : R and omized , controlled trial . SETTING : Four midwestern Veterans Affairs medical facilities . PATIENTS / PARTICIPANTS : One thous and , one hundred fifty-two male veterans age 50 and older with primary care appointments at participating facilities were r and omized and 893 completed follow-up . INTERVENTIONS : Patients were r and omized to mailed pamphlet , mailed video , or usual care/control . MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS : Outcomes assessed by phone survey 2 weeks postintervention included a 10-item knowledge index ; correct responses to questions on CaP natural history , treatment efficacy , the prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) ’s predictive value , and expert disagreement about the PSA ; whether screening was discussed with provider ; screening preferences ; and PSA testing rates . Mean knowledge index scores were higher for video ( 7.44 ; P=.001 ) and pamphlet ( 7.26 ; P=.03 ) subjects versus controls ( 6.90 ) . Video and pamphlet subjects reported significantly higher percentages of correct responses relative to controls to questions on CaP natural history ( 63 % , 63 % , and 54 % , respectively ) ; treatment efficacy ( 19 % , 20 % , and 5 % ) , and expert disagreement ( 28 % , 19 % , and 8 % ) , but not PSA accuracy ( 28 % , 22 % , and 22 % ) . Pamphlet subjects were more likely than controls to discuss screening with their provider ( 41 % vs 32 % ; P=.03 ) but video subjects were not ( 35 % ; P=.33 ) . Video and pamphlet subjects were less likely to intend to have a PSA , relative to controls ( 63 % , 65 % , and 74 % , respectively ) . PSA testing rates did not differ significantly across groups . CONCLUSIONS : Mailed interventions enhance patient knowledge and self-reported participation in decision making , and alter screening preferences . The pamphlet and video interventions evaluated are comparable in effectiveness . The lower-cost pamphlet approach is an attractive option for clinics with limited re sources', 'Background Bisphosphonates can reduce fracture risk in patients with osteoporosis , but many at-risk patients do not start or adhere to these medications . The aims of this study are to : ( 1 ) preliminarily evaluate the effect of an individualized 10-year osteoporotic fracture risk calculator and decision aid ( OSTEOPOROSIS CHOICE ) for postmenopausal women at risk for osteoporotic fractures ; and ( 2 ) assess the feasibility and validity ( i.e. , absence of contamination ) of patient-level r and omization ( vs. cluster r and omization ) in pilot trials of decision aid efficacy . Methods / Design This is a protocol for a parallel , 2-arm , r and omized trial to compare an intervention group receiving OSTEOPOROSIS CHOICE to a control group receiving usual primary care .  Postmenopausal women with bone mineral density T-scores of < -1.0 , not receiving bisphosphonate therapy , and receiving care at participating primary care practice s in and around Rochester , Minnesota , USA will be eligible to participate in the trial . We will measure the effect of OSTEOPOROSIS CHOICE on five outcomes : ( a ) patient knowledge regarding osteoporosis risk factors and treatment ; ( b ) quality of the decision-making process for both the patient and clinician ; ( c ) patient and clinician acceptability and satisfaction with the decision aid ; ( d ) rate of bisphosphonate use and adherence , and ( e ) trial processes ( e.g. , ability to recruit participants , collect patient outcomes ) . To capture these outcomes , we will use patient and clinician surveys following each visit and video recordings of the clinical encounters . These video recordings will also allow us to determine the extent to which clinicians previously exposed to the decision aid were able to recreate elements of the decision aid with control patients ( i.e. , contamination ) . Pharmacy prescription profiles and follow-up phone interviews will assess medication start and adherence at 6 months . Discussion This pilot trial will provide evidence of feasibility , validity of patient r and omization , and preliminary efficacy of a novel approach -- decision aids -- to improving medication adherence for postmenopausal women at risk of osteoporotic fractures . The results will inform the design of a larger trial that could provide more precise estimates of the efficacy of the decision aid . Trial registration Clinical Trials.gov Identifier :', \"BACKGROUND A consulting method known as ' shared decision making ' ( SDM ) has been described and operationalized in terms of several ' competences ' . One of these competences concerns the discussion of the risks and benefits of treatment or care options-'risk communication ' . Few data exist on clinicians ' ability to acquire skills and implement the competences of SDM or risk communication in consultations with patients . OBJECTIVE The aims of this study were to evaluate the effects of skill development workshops for SDM and the use of risk communication aids on the process of consultations . METHODS A cluster r and omized trial with crossover was carried out with the participation of 20 recently qualified GPs in urban and rural general practice s in Gwent , South Wales . A total of 747 patients with known atrial fibrillation , prostatism , menorrhagia or menopausal symptoms were invited to a consultation to review their condition or treatments . Half the consultations were r and omly selected for audio-taping , of which 352 patients attended and were audio-taped successfully . After baseline , participating doctors were r and omized to receive training in ( i ) SDM skills or ( ii ) the use of simple risk communication aids , using simulated patients . The alternative training was then provided for the final study phase . Patients were allocated r and omly to a consultation during baseline or intervention 1 ( SDM or risk communication aids ) or intervention 2 phases . A r and omly selected half of the consultations were audio-taped from each phase . Raters ( independent , trained and blinded to study phase ) assessed the audio-tapes using a vali date d scale to assess levels of patient involvement ( OPTION : observing patient involvement ) , and to analyse the nature of risk information discussed . Clinicians completed question naires after each consultation , assessing perceived clinician-patient agreement and level of patient involvement in decisions . Multilevel modelling was carried out with the OPTION score as the dependent variable , and rater , consultation and clinician levels of data , st and ardized by rater within clinician . RESULTS Following each of the interventions , the clinicians significantly increased their involvement of patients in decision making ( OPTION score increased by 10.6 following risk communication training [ 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 7.9 -13.3 ; P < 0.001 ] and by 12.9 after SDM skill development ( 95 % CI 10 -15.8 , P < 0.001 ) , a moderate effect size . The level of involvement achieved by the risk communication aids was significantly increased by the subsequent introduction of the skill development workshops ( 7.7 increase in OPTION score , 95 % CI 3.4 - 12 ; P < 0.001 ) . The alternative sequence ( skills followed by risk communication aids ) did not achieve this effect . The use of most risk information formats increased after the provision of specific risk communication aids ( P < 0.001 ) . Clinicians using the risk communication tools perceived significantly higher patient and clinician agreement on treatment ( P < 0.001 ) , patient satisfaction with information ( P < 0.01 ) , clinician satisfaction with decision ( P < 0.01 ) and general overall satisfaction with the consultation ( P < 0.001 ) than those who were exposed to SDM skill development workshops . CONCLUSIONS These clinicians were able to acquire the skills to implement SDM competences and to use risk communication aids . Each intervention provided independent effects . Further progress towards greater patient involvement in health care decision making is possible , and skill development in this area should be incorporated into postgraduate professional development programmes\", 'Background Despite the widely reported success of total joint arthroplasty ( TJA ) in reducing pain and improving quality of life and function for patients with hip or knee osteoarthritis , rates of TJA use vary widely throughout the United States , with broad disparities based on geographic , racial , and socioeconomic factors . Shared decision-making approaches , which require an exchange of information between patients and their physicians , can be helpful in improving patient satisfaction with their treatment decision and appropriate use of TJA . Questions /hypothesesExpected-value decision analysis models incorporating evidence -based outcome data with individual patient preferences regarding health states and willingness to pay , when used in shared decision-making models , will improve satisfaction among patients with hip or knee osteoarthritis and lead to more appropriate use of TJA.Proposed Program Patients with hip or knee osteoarthritis will be r and omized to usual care or participation in a shared decision-making intervention . Patients in the shared decision-making intervention arm will have their preferences for individual health states related to osteoarthritis and TJA measured using the time trade-off technique , and these values will be incorporated in an expected-value decision analysis model , which also will incorporate the patient ’s willingness to pay for a particular treatment intervention and evidence -based outcome probabilities . The patient ’s decision for operative versus nonoperative care and their level of satisfaction with their decision will be compared using chi square and Mann-Whitney rank-sum tests . Significance Information regarding patient preferences for particular health states and willingness to pay can be combined with evidence -based outcome data in expected-value decision analysis models , which will help inform shared clinical decision making between surgeons and their patients with hip or knee osteoarthritis', 'OBJECTIVE : To determine the effect of the Ischemic Heart Disease Shared Decision-Making Program ( IHD SDP ) an interactive videodisc design ed to assist patients in the decision-making process involving treatment choices for ischemic heart disease , on patient decision-making . DESIGN : R and omized , controlled trial . SETTING : The Toronto Hospital , University of Toronto , Toronto , Ontario , Canada . PARTICIPANTS : Two hundred forty ambulatory patients with ischemic heart disease amenable to elective revascularization and ongoing medical therapy . MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS : The primary outcome was patient satisfaction with the decision-making process . This was measured using the 12-item Decision-Making Process Question naire that was developed and vali date d in a r and omized trial of the benign prostatic hyperplasia SDP . Secondary outcomes included patient knowledge ( measured using 20 questions about knowledge deemed necessary for an informed treatment decision ) , treatment decision , patient-angiographer agreement on decision , and general health scores . Outcomes were measured at the time of treatment decision and /or at 6 months follow-up . Shared decision-making program scores were similar for the intervention and control group ( 71 % and 70 % , respectively ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] for 1 % difference , −3 % to 7 % ) . The intervention group had higher knowledge scores ( 75 % vs 62 % ; 95 % CI for 13 % difference , 8 % to 18 % ) . The intervention group chose to pursue revascularization less often ( 58 % vs 75 % for the controls ; 95 % CI for 17 % difference , 4 % to 31 % ) . At 6 months , 52 % of the intervention group and 66 % of the controls had undergone revascularization ( 95 % CI for 14 % difference , 0 % to 28 % ) . General health and angina scores were not different between the groups at 6 months . Exposure to the IHD SDP result ed in more patient-angiographer disagreement about treatment decisions . CONCLUSIONS : There was no significant difference in satisfaction with decision-making process scores between the IHD SDP and usual practice groups . The IHD SDP  patients were more knowledgeable , underwent less revascularization ( interventional therapies ) , and demonstrated increased patient decision-making autonomy without apparent impact on quality of life', 'Background Prostate cancer is the most common male cancer in the Western world but is highly heterogeneous in disease progression and outcomes .

Participants are assessed at baseline ( before treatment ) and 2 , 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months post-treatment . Outcome measures include : cancer threat appraisal ; decision-related distress and bother from treatment side effects ; involvement in decision making ; satisfaction with health care ; heath care utilisation ; use of health care re sources ; and a return to previous activities . Discussion The study will provide recommendations about the efficacy of early decision support to facilitate adjustment after prostate cancer . As well the study will identify men diagnosed with localised prostate cancer at risk of poorer long term psychosocial adjustment . Trial Registration ACTRN012607000233426', \"Presenting treatment options to men with localized prostate cancer is difficult because of the lack of definitive evidence and the range of treatment options available . Active surveillance and monitoring programs are now a recognized treatment option for men with low-risk localized prostate cancer , but many patients are not fully aware of the details of such programs , and most still opt for immediate radical ( surgery or radiotherapy ) treatment . The provision of high- quality information with decision aids has been shown to increase the acceptability of active surveillance/monitoring programs . This chapter outlines techniques for providing high- quality information about active surveillance/monitoring , based on the findings of a r and omized controlled trial of treatments for localized prostate cancer . The ProtecT ( Prostate testing for cancer and Treatment ) trial has r and omized over 1500 men between active monitoring , radical surgery , and radical radiotherapy by ensuring that information was tailored to men 's existing knowledge and views . Care was taken with the content , order , and enthusiasm of the presentation of treatments by recruitment staff , and clinicians and other health professionals were supported to feel comfortable with being open about the uncertainties in the evidence and helped to rephrase terminology likely to be misinterpreted by patients . These techniques of information provision should be added to the use of decision aids to enable patients diagnosed with clinical ly localized prostate cancer in routine practice to reach well-informed and reasoned decisions about their treatment , including full consideration of active surveillance and monitoring programs\", 'Background : This r and omized , controlled trial assessed the impact of a tailored navigation intervention versus a st and ard mailed intervention on  colorectal cancer screening adherence and screening decision stage ( SDS ) . Methods : Primary care patients ( n = 945 ) were surveyed and r and omized to a  Tailored Navigation Intervention ( TNI ) Group ( n = 312 ) , St and ard Intervention ( SI ) Group ( n = 316 ) , or usual care Control Group ( n = 317 ) . TNI Group participants were sent colonoscopy instructions and /or stool blood tests according to reported test preference , and received a navigation call . The SI Group was sent both colonoscopy instructions and stool blood tests . Multivariable analyses assessed intervention impact on adherence and change in SDS at 6 months . Results : The primary outcome , screening adherence ( TNI Group : 38 % , SI Group : 33 % , Control Group : 12 % ) , was higher for intervention recipients than controls ( P = 0.001 and P = 0.001 , respectively ) , but the two intervention groups did not differ significantly ( P = 0.201 ) . Positive SDS change ( TNI Group : + 45 % , SI Group : + 37 % , and Control Group : + 23 % ) was significantly greater among intervention recipients than controls ( P = 0.001 and P = 0.001 , respectively ) , and the intervention group difference approached significance ( P = 0.053 ) . Secondary analyses indicate that tailored navigation boosted preferred test use , and suggest that intervention impact on adherence and SDS was attenuated by limited access to screening options . Conclusions : Both interventions had significant , positive effects on outcomes compared with usual care . TNI versus SI impact had a modest positive impact on adherence and a pronounced effect on SDS . Impact : Mailed screening tests can boost adherence . Research is needed to determine how preference , access , and navigation affect screening outcomes .

Their control could reduce the burden of heart disease across population s. Several drugs are used to control hypertension , but the only consistently effective treatment of OSA is continuous positive airway pressure . The identification of a drug capable of improving OSA and hypertension simultaneously would provide a novel approach in the treatment of both diseases . Methods / Design This is a r and omized double-blind clinical trial , comparing the use of chlorthalidone with amiloride versus amlodipine as a first drug option in patients older than 40 years of age with stage I hypertension ( 140 to 159/90 to 99 mmHg ) and moderate OSA ( 15 to 30 apneas/hour of sleep ) . The primary outcomes are the variation of the number of apneas per hour and blood pressure measured by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring . The secondary outcomes are adverse events , somnolence scale ( Epworth ) , ventilatory parameters and C reactive protein levels . The follow-up will last 8 weeks . There will be 29 participants per group . The project has been approved by the ethics committee of our institution . Discussion The role of fluid retention in OSA has been known for several decades . The use of diuretics are well established in treating hypertension but have never been appropriately tested for sleep apnea . As well as testing the efficacy of these drugs , this study will help to underst and the mechanisms that link hypertension and sleep apnea and their treatment . Trial registration Clinical Trials.gov :', 'The aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of a decision aid ( DA ) and its timing in women being tested for a BRCA1/2 mutation . Women with and without a previous history of cancer were included after blood sampling for genetic testing . The DA consisted of a brochure and video providing information on screening and prophylactic surgery . To evaluate the impact of the DA , women were r and omised to the DA group ( n=184 ) , receiving the  DA  2 weeks after  blood  sampling , or to the  control group ( n=184 ) . To evaluate the impact of timing , mutation carriers who had received the DA before the test result ( n=47 ) were compared to mutation carriers who received the DA after the test result ( n=42 ) . Data were collected on well-being , treatment choice , decision and information related outcomes . The impact of the DA was measured 4 weeks after blood sampling . The impact of timing was measured 2 weeks after a positive test result . The DA had no impact on well-being . Regarding decision related outcomes , the DA group more frequently considered prophylactic surgery  ( P=0.02 ) corroborated with higher valuations ( P=0.04 ) . No differences were found for the other decision related outcomes . Regarding information related outcomes , the DA group felt better informed ( P=0.00 ) , was more satisfied with the information ( P=0.00 ) , and showed more accurate risk perceptions . Timing of the DA had no effect on any of the outcomes . No interactions were found between the DA and history of cancer . In conclusion , women being tested for a BRCA1/2 mutation benefit from the DA on information related outcomes . Because timing had no effect , the DA is considered useful either before or after the test result', 'OBJECTIVE Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) underestimate their risk of developing severe complications , and they do not always underst and the risk communication by their caregivers . The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of an intervention focused on the communication of the absolute 10-year risk of developing cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) in patients with T2DM . RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS A r and omized controlled trial was performed in T2DM patients newly referred to the Diabetes Care System ( DCS ) West-Friesl and , a managed-care system in the Netherl and s. The intervention group ( n = 131 ) received a six-step CVD risk communication .  Control subjects ( n = 130 ) received st and ard managed care . The primary outcome measure was appropriateness of risk perception ( difference between actual CVD risk calculated by the UK Prospect i ve Diabetes Study risk engine and risk perception ) . Secondary outcome measures were illness perceptions , attitude and intention to change behavior , satisfaction with the communication , and anxiety and worry about CVD risk . Patients completed question naires at baseline , at 2 weeks ( immediately after the intervention ) , and at 12 weeks . RESULTS Appropriateness of risk perception improved between the intervention and control groups at 2 weeks . This effect disappeared at 12 weeks . No effects were found on illness perceptions , attitude and intention to change behavior , or anxiety and worry about CVD risk . Patients in the intervention group were significantly more satisfied with the communication . CONCLUSIONS This risk communication method improved patients ’ risk perception at 2 weeks but not at 12 weeks . Negative effects were not found , as patients did not become anxious or worried after the CVD risk communication', \"PURPOSE To determine whether the use of a goals -of-care video to supplement a verbal description can improve end-of-life decision making for patients with cancer . METHODS Fifty participants with malignant glioma were r and omly assigned to either a verbal narrative of goals -of-care options at the end of life ( control ) , or a video after the same verbal narrative ( intervention ) in this r and omized controlled trial . The video depicts three levels of medical care : life-prolonging care ( cardiopulmonary resuscitation [ CPR ] , ventilation ) , basic care ( hospitalization , no CPR ) , and comfort care ( symptom relief ) . The primary study outcome was participants ' preferences for end-of-life care . The secondary outcome was participants ' uncertainty regarding decision making ( score range , 3 to 15 ; higher score indicating less uncertainty ) . Participants ' comfort level with the video was also measured . RESULTS Fifty participants were r and omly assigned to either the verbal narrative ( n = 27 ) or video ( n = 23 ) . After the verbal description , 25.9 % of participants preferred life-prolonging care , 51.9 % basic care , and 22.2 % comfort care . In the video arm , no participants preferred life-prolonging care , 4.4 % preferred basic care , 91.3 % preferred comfort care , and 4.4 % were uncertain ( P < .0001 ) . The mean uncertainty score was higher in the video group than in the verbal group ( 13.7 v 11.5 , respectively ; P < .002 ) . In the intervention arm , 82.6 % of participants reported being very comfortable watching the video . CONCLUSION Compared with participants who only heard a verbal description , participants who viewed a goals -of-care video were more likely to prefer comfort care and avoid CPR , and were more certain of their end-of-life decision making . Participants reported feeling comfortable watching the video\", \"Background Decision aids are often used to assist individuals confronted with a diagnosis of a serious illness to make decisions about treatment options . However , they are rarely utilised to help those with chronic or age related conditions to make decisions about care services . Decision aids should also be useful for carers of people with decreased decisional capacity . These carers ' choices must balance health outcomes for themselves and for salient others with relational and value-based concerns , while relying on information from health professionals . This paper reports on a study that both developed and pilot tested a decision aid aim ed at assisting carers to make evaluative judgements of community services , particularly respite care . Methods A mixed method sequential study , involving qualitative development and a pilot r and omised controlled trial , was conducted in Tasmania , Australia . We undertook 13 semi-structured interviews and three focus groups to inform the development of the decision aid . For the r and omised control trial we r and omly assigned 31 carers of people with dementia to either receive the service decision aid  at the start or end of the study . The primary outcome was measured by comparing the difference in carer burden between the two groups three months after the intervention group received the decision aid . Pilot data was collected from carers using interviewer-administered question naires at the commencement of the project , two weeks and 12 weeks later . Results The qualitative data strongly suggest that the intervention provides carers with needed decision support . Most carers felt that the decision aid was useful . The trial data demonstrated that , using the mean change between baseline and three month follow-up , the intervention group had less increase in burden , a decrease in decisional conflict and increased knowledge compared to control group participants . Conclusions While these results must be interpreted with caution due to the small sample size , all intervention results trend in a direction that is beneficial for carers and their decisional ability . Mixed method data suggest the decision aid provides decisional support that carers do not otherwise receive . Decision aids may prove useful in a community health services context .Trial registration numberIS RCT N : IS RCT\", 'OBJECTIVES Assessing the efficacy of an educational intervention that aim ed to reduce unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions in primary care by motivating GPs to change their attitudes to communication and by empowering patients . METHODS One hundred and four GPs in North-Rhine/Westphalia-Lippe , Germany were cluster-r and omized into intervention and control . GPs r and omized to receive the intervention were visited by peers . The intervention strategy was focused on the communication within the encounter , not on sharing knowledge about antibiotic prescribing . Leaflets and posters were provided that aim ed at patient empowerment , thus enabling patients to raise the topic of antibiotic prescriptions themselves . RESULTS Eighty-six GPs ( 83 % ) remained in the study at 6 weeks and 61 GPs ( 59 % ) at 12 months . Antibiotic prescription rates within the control group were 54.7 % at baseline and 36.4 % within the intervention group at baseline . Generalized estimating equation models were applied . Baseline imbalances and confounding variables were controlled by adjustment . After the intervention , the ORs for the prescription of an antibiotic dropped to 0.58 [ 95 % CI : ( 0.43;0.78 ) , P < 0.001 ] after 6 weeks and were 0.72 [ 95 % CI : ( 0.54;0.97 ) , P = 0.028 ] after 12 months in the intervention group . In the control group , the ORs rose to 1.52 [ 95 % CI : ( 1.19;1.95 ) , P = 0.001 ] after 6 weeks and were 1.31 [ 95 % CI : ( 1.01;1.71 ) , P = 0.044 ] after 12 months ; these ORs correspond to an approximately 60 % relative reduction in antibiotic prescription rates at 6 weeks and a persistent 40 % relative reduction at 12 months . CONCLUSIONS An interventional strategy that focused on doctor-patient communication and patient empowerment is an effective concept to reduce antibiotic prescriptions in primary care', 'Background To evaluate feasibility and potential effectiveness of a patient decision aid ( PtDA ) for patients and a preference report for surgeons to reduce wait times and improve decision quality in patients with osteoarthritis considering total knee replacement . Methods A prospect i ve two-arm pilot r and omized controlled trial . Patients with osteoarthritis were eligible if they understood English and were referred for surgical consultation about an initial total knee arthroplasty at a Canadian orthopaedic joint assessment clinic . Patients were r and omized to the PtDA intervention or usual education .  The intervention was an osteoarthritis PtDA for patients and a one-page preference report summarizing patients ’ clinical and decisional data for their surgeon . The main feasibility outcomes were rates of recruitment and question naire completion ; the preliminary effectiveness outcomes were wait times and decision quality . Results Of 180 patients eligible for surgical consultation , 142 ( 79 % ) were recruited and r and omized to the PtDA intervention ( n = 71 ) or usual education ( n = 71 ) . Data collection yielded a 93 % question naire completion rate with less than 1 % missing items . After one year , 13 % of patients remained on the surgical wait list . The median time from referral to being off the wait list ( censored using survival analysis techniques ) was 33.4 weeks for the PtDA group ( n = 69 , 95 % CI : 26.0 , 41.4 ) and 33.0 weeks for usual education ( n = 71 , 95 % CI : 26.1 , 39.9 ) . Patients exposed to the PtDA had higher decision quality based on knowledge ( 71 % versus 47 % ; p < 0.0001 ) and quality decision being an informed choice that is consistent with their values for option outcomes ( 56.4 % versus 25.0 % ; p < 0.001 ) . Conclusions Recruitment of patients with osteoarthritis considering surgery and data collection were feasible . As some patients remained on the surgical waiting list after one year , follow-up should be extended to two years . Patients exposed to the PtDA achieved higher decision quality compared to those receiving usual education but there was no difference in wait for surgery . Trials registration Clinical Trials . Gov', \"OBJECTIVES This study measured the effect of information about family planning methods and STD risk factors and prevention , together with personal choice on the selection of  intrauterine devices ( IUDs ) by clients with cervical infection . METHODS We conducted a r and omised , controlled trial in which family planning clients were assigned to one of two groups , the st and ard practice ( control ) group in which the provider selected the woman 's contraceptive and the information and choice ( intervention ) group . The study enrolled 2107 clients in a family planning clinic in Mexico City . RESULTS Only 2.1 % of the clients had gonorrhoea or chlamydial infections . Significantly fewer women in the intervention group selected the IUD than the proportion for whom the IUD was recommended in the st and ard care group by clinicians ( 58.2 % v 88.2 % , p = 0.0000 ) . The difference was even more pronounced among infected women : 47.8 % v 93.2 % ( intervention v control group , p = 0.0006 ) . CONCLUSIONS The intervention increased the selection of condoms and reduced the selection of IUDs , especially among women with cervical infections , for whom IUD insertion is contraindicated\", 'Background Comparative effectiveness research ( CER ) documents important differences in antidepressants in terms of efficacy , safety , cost , and burden to the patient . Decision aids can adapt this evidence to help patients participate in making informed choices . In turn , antidepressant therapy will more likely reflect patients ’ values and context , leading to improved adherence and mood outcomes . Methods / Design The objective of this study is to develop the Depression Medication Choice decision aid for use during primary care encounters , and to test its efficacy by conducting a clustered practical r and omized trial comparing the decision aid to usual depression care in primary care practice s . We will use a novel practice -based , patient-centered approach based on participatory action research that involves a multidisciplinary team of design ers , investigators , clinicians , patient representatives , and other stakeholders for the development of the decision aid . We will then conduct a clustered practical r and omized trial enrolling clinicians and their patients ( n = 300 ) with moderate to severe depression from rural , suburban and inner city primary care practice s ( n = 10 ) . The intervention will consist of the use of the depression medication choice decision aid during the clinical encounter . This trial will generate preliminary evidence of the relative impact of the decision aid on patient involvement in decision making , decision making quality , patient knowledge , and 6-month measures of medication adherence and mental health compared to usual depression care . Discussion Upon completion of the proposed research , we will have developed and evaluated the efficacy of the decision aid depression medication choice as a novel translational tool for CER in depression treatment , engaged patients with depression in their care , and refined the process by which we conduct practice -based trials with limited research footprint . Trial registration Clinical Trials.gov :', 'Background Patients with early stage papillary thyroid carcinoma ( PTC ) , are faced with the decision to either to accept or reject adjuvant radioactive iodine ( RAI ) treatment after thryroidectomy . This decision is often difficult because of conflicting reports of RAI treatment benefit and medical evidence uncertainty due to the lack of long-term r and omized controlled trials . Methods We report the protocol for a parallel , 2-arm , r and omized trial comparing an intervention group exposed to a computerized decision aid ( DA ) relative to a control group receiving usual care . The DA explains the options of adjuvant radioactive iodine or no adjuvant radioactive iodine , as well as associated potential benefits , risks , and follow-up implication s. Potentially eligible adult PTC patient participants will include : English-speaking individuals who have had recent thyroidectomy , and whose primary tumor was 1 to 4 cm in diameter , with no known metastases to lymph nodes or distant sites , with no other worrisome features , and who have not received RAI treatment for thyroid cancer . We will measure the effect of the DA on the following patient outcomes : a ) knowledge about PTC and RAI treatment , b ) decisional conflict , c ) decisional regret , d ) client satisfaction with information received about RAI treatment , and e ) the final decision to accept or reject adjuvant RAI treatment and rationale . Discussion This trial will provide evidence of feasibility and efficacy of the use of a computerized DA in explaining complex issues relating to decision making about adjuvant RAI treatment in early stage PTC.Trial registration Clinical Trials.gov Identifier :', 'Background Efficacious strategies for the primary prevention of coronary heart disease ( CHD ) are underused , and , when used , have low adherence . Existing efforts to improve use and adherence to these efficacious strategies have been so intensive that they are impractical for clinical practice . Methods We conducted a r and omized trial of a CHD prevention intervention ( including a computerized decision aid and automated tailored adherence messages ) at one university general internal medicine practice . After obtaining informed consent and collecting baseline data , we r and omized patients ( men and women age 40 - 79 with no prior history of cardiovascular disease ) to either the intervention or usual care . We then saw them for two additional study visits over 3 months . For intervention participants , we administered the decision aid at the primary study visit ( 1 week after baseline visit ) and then mailed 3 tailored adherence reminders at 2 , 4 , and 6 weeks . We assessed our outcomes ( including the predicted likelihood of angina , myocardial infa rct ion , and CHD death over 10 years ( CHD risk ) and self-reported adherence ) between groups at 3 month follow-up . Data collection occurred from June 2007 through December 2009 . All study procedures were IRB approved . Results We r and omized 160 eligible patients ( 81 intervention ; 79 control ) and followed 96 % to study conclusion . Mean predicted CHD risk at baseline was 11.3 % . The intervention increased self-reported adherence to chosen risk reducing strategies by 25 percentage points ( 95 % CI 8 % to 42 % ) , with the biggest effect for aspirin . It also changed predicted CHD risk by -1.1 % ( 95 % CI -0.16 % to -2 % ) , with a larger effect in a pre-specified subgroup of high risk patients . Conclusion A computerized intervention that involves patients in CHD decision making and supports adherence to effective prevention strategies can improve adherence and reduce predicted CHD risk . Clinical trials registration number Clinical Trials.gov :', 'Background For many women with Rheumatoid Arthritis ( RA ) motherhood decisions are complicated by their condition and complex pharmacological treatments . Decisions about having children or exp and ing their family require relevant knowledge and consultation with their family and physician as conception and pregnancy has to be managed within the RA context . Relevant information is not readily available to women with RA . Therefore a r and omized controlled study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of a new motherhood decision aid ( DA ) developed specifically for women with RA . Methods One hundred and forty-four women were r and omly allocated to either an intervention or control group . All women completed a battery of question naires at pre-intervention , including , the  Pregnancy in Rheumatoid Arthritis Question naire ( PiRAQ ) , the Decisional Conflict Scale ( DCS ) , the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale ( HADS ) , and the Arthritis Self-Efficacy Scale ( ASES ) , and provided basic demographic information . Women in the DA group were sent an electronic version of the DA , and completed the battery of question naires for a second time post-intervention . Results Women who received the DA had a 13 % increase in relevant knowledge ( PiRAQ ) scores and a 15 % decrease in scores on the decisional conflict ( DCS ) , compared to the control group ( 1 % , 2 % respectively ) . No adverse psychological effects were detected as evident in unchanged levels of depression and anxiety symptoms . Conclusions The findings of this study suggest that this DA may be an effective tool in assisting women with RA when contemplating having children or more children .

Design : R and omised controlled trial . Setting : 26 general practice s in the United Kingdom . Participants : 205 women considering hormone replacement therapy .  Intervention : Patients ' decision aid consisting of an interactive multimedia programme with booklet and printed summary . Outcome measures : Patients ' and general practitioners ' perceptions of who made the decision , decisional conflict , treatment choice , menopausal symptoms , costs , anxiety , and general health status . Results : Both patients and general practitioners found the decision aid acceptable . At three months , mean scores for decisional conflict were significantly lower in the intervention group than in the control group ( 2.5 v 2.8 ; mean difference −0.3 , 95 % confidence interval −0.5 to −0.2 ) ; this difference was maintained during follow up . A higher proportion of general practitioners perceived that treatment decisions had been made “ mainly or only ” by the patient in the intervention group than in the control group ( 55 % v 31 % ; 24 % , 8 % to 40 % ) . At three months a lower proportion of women in the intervention group than in the control group were undecided about treatment ( 14 % v 26 % ; −12 % , −23 % to −0.4 % ) , and a higher proportion had decided against hormone replacement therapy  ( 46 % v 32 % ; 14 % , 1 % to 28 % ) ; these differences were no longer apparent by nine months . No differences were found between the groups for anxiety , use of health service re sources , general health status , or utility . The higher costs of the intervention were largely due to the video disc technology used . Conclusions : An interactive multimedia decision aid in the NHS would be popular with patients , reduce decisional conflict , and let patients play a more active part in decision making without increasing anxiety . The use of web based technology would reduce the cost of the intervention . What is already known on this topic Patients want more information about their conditions and treatment options , and many want to play an active part in decision making Decision aids improve patients ' knowledge of their conditions and treatment options What this study adds The decision aid was acceptable to both the patients and their general practitioners Decisional conflict was reduced in the intervention group Patients who viewed the programme played a more active part in the decision making process and were no more anxious than control patients Such aids could be introduced throughout the NHS at relatively low cost by using the\", 'BACKGROUND In response to the isolation of the BRCA1 gene , a breast-ovarian cancer-susceptibility gene , biotechnology companies are already marketing genetic tests to health care providers and to the public . Initial studies indicate interest in BRCA1 testing in the general public and in population s at high risk . However , the optimal strategies for educating and counseling individuals have yet to be determined . PURPOSE Our goal was to evaluate the impact of alternate strategies for pretest education and counseling on decision-making regarding BRCA1 testing among women at low to moderate risk who have a family history of breast and /or ovarian cancer . METHODS A r and omized trial design was used to evaluate the effects of education only ( educational approach ) and education plus counseling ( counseling approach ) , as compared with a waiting-list ( control ) condition ( n = 400 for all groups combined ) . The educational approach review ed information about personal risk factors , inheritance of cancer susceptibility , the benefits , limitations , and risks of BRCA1 testing , and cancer screening and prevention options . The counseling approach included this information , as well as a personalized discussion of experiences with cancer in the family and the potential psychological and social impact of testing . Data on knowledge of inherited cancer and BRCA1 test characteristics , perceived risk , perceived benefits , limitations and risks of BRCA1 testing , and testing intentions were collected by use of structured telephone interviews at baseline and at 1-month follow-up . Provision of a blood sample for future testing served as a proxy measure of intention to be tested ( in the education and counseling arms of the study ) . The effects of intervention group on study outcomes were evaluated by use of hierarchical linear regression modeling and logistic regression modeling ( for the blood sample outcome ) . All P values are for two-sided tests . RESULTS The educational and counseling approaches both led to significant increases in knowledge , relative to the control condition ( P < .001 for both ) . The counseling approach , but not the educational approach , was superior to the control condition in producing significant increases in perceived limitations and risks of BRCA1 testing ( P < .01 ) and decreases in perceived benefits ( P < .05 ) . However , neither approach produced changes in intentions to have BRCA1 testing . Prior to and following both education only and education plus counseling , approximately one half of the participants stated that they intended to be tested ; after the session , 52 % provided a blood sample . CONCLUSIONS St and ard educational approaches may be equally effective as exp and ed counseling approaches in enhancing knowledge . Since knowledge is a key aspect of medical decision-making , st and ard education may be adequate in situations where genetic testing must be streamlined . On the other h and , it has been argued that optimal decision-making requires not only knowledge , but also a reasoned evaluation of the positive and negative consequences of alternate decisions . Although the counseling approach is more likely to achieve this goal , it may not diminish interest in testing , even among women at low to moderate risk . Future research should focus on the merits of these alternate approaches for subgroups of individuals with different background s who are being counseled in the variety of setting s where BRCA1 testing is likely to be offered', 'Objective To evaluate the effects of a multifaceted empowerment strategy on the actual use of single embryo transfer after in vitro fertilisation . Design R and omised controlled trial . Setting Five in vitro fertilisation clinics in the Netherl and s. Participants 308 couples ( women aged < 40 ) on the waiting list for a first in vitro fertilisation cycle . Interventions The multifaceted strategy aim ed to empower couples in deciding how many embryos should be transferred . The strategy consisted of a decision aid , support of a nurse specialising in in vitro fertilisation , and the offer of reimbursement by way of an extra treatment cycle . The control group received st and ard care for in vitro fertilisation . Main outcome measures Use of single embryo transfer in the first and second treatment cycles as well as decision making variables and costs of the empowerment strategy . Results After the first treatment cycle , single embryo transfer was used by 43 % ( 65/152 ) of couples in the intervention group and 32 % ( 50/156 ) in the control group ( difference 11 % , 95 % confidence interval 0 % to 22 % ; P=0.05 ) . After the second treatment cycle , single embryo transfer was used by 26 % ( 14/154 ) of couples in the intervention group compared with 16 % ( 8/51 ) in the control group ( difference 10 % , −6 % to 26 % ; P=0.20 ) . Compared with couples receiving st and ard care , those receiving the empowerment strategy had significantly higher empowerment and knowledge levels but no differences in anxiety levels . Mean total savings per couple in the intervention group were calculated to be € 169.75 ( £ 146.77 ; $ 219.12 ) . Conclusions A multifaceted empowerment strategy encouraged use of single embryo transfer , increased patients ’ knowledge , reduced costs , and had no effect on levels of anxiety or depression . This strategy could therefore be an important tool to reduce the twin pregnancy rate after in vitro fertilisation . This trial did not , however , demonstrate the anticipated 25 % difference in use of single embryo transfer of the power calculation . Trial registration Clinical Trials.gov NCT00315029', 'BACKGROUND Practice variation in the primary care treatment of depression may be considerable in the Netherl and s , due to relatively small and unregulated practice s. We adapted the collaborative care model for the treatment of Major Depressive Disorder ( MDD ) to accommo date existing practice variation and tested whether this had added value over Care as Usual ( CAU ) . METHODS A cluster r and omized controlled trial was conducted to compare an adapted target driven collaborative care model with Care as Usual ( CAU ) .  R and omization was at the level of 18 (sub)urban primary care centers . The care manager and GP were supported by a web-based tracking and decision aid system that advised targeted treatment actions to achieve rapid response and if possible remission , and that warned the consultant psychiatrist if such treatment advice was not followed up . Eligible patients had a score of 10 or higher on the PHQ9 , and met diagnostic criteria for major depression at the subsequent MINI Neuropsychiatric interview . A total of 93 patients were identified by screening . They received either collaborative care ( CC ) or CAU .  Another 56 patients received collaborative care  after identification by the GP . The outcome measures were response to treatment ( 50 % or greater reduction of the PHQ9-total score from baseline ) at three , six , nine and twelve months , and remission ( a score of 0 - 4 on the PHQ9 at follow-up ) . RESULTS Treatment response and remission in CAU were low . Collaborative care was more effective on achieving treatment response than CAU at three months for the total group of patients who received collaborative care [ OR 5.2 ( ( 1.41 - 16.09 ) , NNT 2 ] and at nine months [ OR 5.6 ( ( 1.40 - 22.58 ) ) , NNT 3 ] . The effect was not statistically significant at 6 and 12 months . LIMITATIONS A relatively high percentage of patients ( 36.5 % ) did not return one or more follow-up question naires . There was no evidence for selective non response . CONCLUSIONS Our adapted target driven CC was considerably more effective than CAU for MDD in primary care in the Netherl and s. The Numbers Needed To Treat ( NNT ) to achieve response in one additional patient were low ( 2 - 3 ) , which suggest that introducing CC at a larger scale may be beneficial . The relatively large effects may be due to our focus on reducing practice variation through the introduction of easy to use web based tracking and decision aids . The findings are highly relevant for the application of the model in areas where practice s tend to be small and for mixed healthcare systems such as in many countries in Europe . TRIAL REGISTRATION Dutch trial register IS RCT N15266438 ( http://www.trialregister.nl/trialreg/admin/ rct view.asp?TC=820 )', \"Objectives To establish whether the provision of numerical data using pictograms and framed as event rates affects subjects ' attitudes to colorectal cancer ( CRC ) screening . Design R and omized question naire and telephone study comparing a control group given st and ard NHS CRC information leaflets with an intervention group given the same leaflet but enhanced with additional numerical and pictorial information . Setting District General hospital and two general practice s in North East Engl and . Study carried out immediately prior to the introduction of CRC screening . Participants A total of 478 non-gastroenterological subjects ( age range 60–70 years ) . Main outcome measures The difference in the two groups ' overall wish to be screened ; comparison of the impact of enhanced vs. unenhanced summary points in the NHS information leaflet ; the summary point that most influenced their decision on screening ; the views of the intervention group on the additional numerical and pictorial information provided . Results A total of 256 ( 54 % ) responded ( 124 from the control group and 117 from the intervention group ) ; 22 % were interviewed by telephone ; 90 % of the control group and 85 % of the intervention group wished to be screened ( P = 0.34 ) . Provision of numerical and pictorial information significantly changed the impact of five of the six summary points on the decision to be screened . Sixty-two percent of the intervention group found the pictograms helpful while 83 % of those interviewed by telephone found the numerical data helpful ; 73 % of the control group when given by telephone the additional numerical information given to the intervention group said this would have been useful in aiding their decision-making . Conclusion Providing additional numerical information would enhance the credibility of the screening programme without necessarily reducing the numbers screened\", 'Previous research has shown that people err when making decisions aided by probability information . Surprisingly , there has been little exploration into the accuracy of decisions made based on many commonly used probabilistic display methods . Two experiments examined the ability of a comprehensive set of such methods to effectively communicate critical information to a decision maker and influence confidence in decision making . The second experiment investigated the performance of these methods under time pressure , a situational factor known to exacerbate judgmental errors . Ten commonly used graphical display methods were r and omly assigned to participants . Across eight scenarios in which a probabilistic outcome was described , participants were asked questions regarding graph interpretation ( e.g. , mean ) and made behavioral choices ( i.e. , act ; do not act ) based on the provided information indicated that decision-maker accuracy differed by graphical method ; error bars and boxplots led to greatest mean estimation and behavioral choice accuracy whereas complementary cumulative probability distribution functions were associated with the highest probability estimation accuracy . Under time pressure ,  participant performance decreased when making behavioral choices', 'Purpose . To carry out a r and omized controlled trial of a decision aid for women at increased risk of developing ovarian cancer to facilitate decision making regarding risk management options . Methods . This r and omized trial , conducted through 6 familial cancer centers , compared the efficacy of tailored decision aid to that of a general educational pamphlet in preparing women for decision making . Participants . 131 women with a family history of breast and /or ovarian cancer or of hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer . Outcome measures . Decisional conflict , knowledge about ovarian cancer risk management options , and psychological adjustment were reassessed at 3 time points . Results . Compared to those who received the pamphlet ( control ) , women who received the decision aid ( intervention ) were significantly more likely to report a high degree of acceptability of the educational material at both follow-up assessment time points . Findings indicate neither group experienced significant increases in psychological distress at either follow-up assessment time points relative to baseline . Two weeks postintervention , the intervention group demonstrated a significant decrease in decisional conflict compared to the control group ( t = 2.4 , P < 0.025 ) and a trend for a greater increase in knowledge about risk management options ( t = 2.1 , P = 0.037 ) . No significant differences were found 6 months postintervention . Conclusion . This form of educational material is successful in increasing knowledge about risk management options and in reducing decisional conflict in the shorter term . The decision aid is an effective and acceptable strategy for patient education to facilitate an inclusive and informed decision-making process about managing ovarian cancer risk', 'BACKGROUND Professional organizations recommend that physicians discuss prostate cancer with patients to make individual screening decisions . However , few studies have tested strategies to encourage such discussion s , particularly among high-risk population s. We examined the effects of two low-literacy interventions on the frequency of prostate cancer discussion and screening . DESIGN R and omized , blinded , controlled trial with concealed allocation . SETTING / PARTICIPANTS Inner-city primary care clinic , serving a predominately African-American population . Participants were men aged 45 - 70 with no history of prostate cancer , presenting for a regular appointment . INTERVENTIONS While waiting to see their physician , patients received a patient education h and out on prostate cancer screening ( PtEd ) , a h and out simply encouraging patients to talk to their doctor about prostate cancer ( Cue ) , or a control h and out . The interventions did not advocate for or against screening .  MEASURES Patient-reported discussion of prostate cancer with the physician and chart review s determine prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) test orders and performance of digital rectal examination ( DRE ) . Adjusted odds ratios ( aOR ) and 95 % confidence intervals ( CI ) were computed . Data were collected in 2003 , and analyses were completed in 2006 . RESULTS Most of the 250 subjects ( 90.4 % ) were African American and 78.8 % read below the ninth grade level . Overall , 48.4 % reported discussing prostate cancer during the appointment . Compared to the control group ( 37.3 % ) , discussion s were significantly more common in the Cue group ( 58.0 % , aOR=2.39 [ 1.26 - 4.52 ] ) , as well as in the PtEd group ( 50.0 % , aOR=1.92 [ 1.01 - 3.65 ] ) . When prostate cancer was discussed , patients in the intervention groups more commonly initiated the conversation ( 47.6 % PtEd and 40.0 % Cue , vs 9.7 % control , p<0.01 for each comparison to control ) . Compared to the control group ( 2.4 % ) , PSA test orders increased in the PtEd group ( 14.1 % , aOR=7.62 [ 1.62 - 35.83 ] ) and in the Cue group ( 12.3 % , aOR=5.86 [ 1.24 - 27.81 ] ) . Documentation of DRE did not change significantly ( 4.7 % PtEd , 6.2 % Cue , and 6.0 % control ) . CONCLUSIONS Two simple low-literacy interventions significantly increased discussion of prostate cancer and PSA test orders but not performance of DRE . Both interventions were effective in empowering low-literacy patients to initiate conversations about prostate cancer with their physician', \"OBJECTIVE Fibromyalgia syndrome ( FMS ) is a condition of chronic widespread pain that is difficult to control and is associated with strains in physician-patient interaction . Shared decision making ( SDM ) can be a potential solution to improve interaction . We evaluated the effects of an SDM intervention , including an SDM communication training program for physicians , in a r and omized controlled trial with FMS patients . The main objective was to assess whether SDM improves the quality of physician-patient interaction from patients ' perspective . METHODS Patients were r and omized to either an SDM group or an information-only group .  The SDM group was treated by physicians trained in SDM communication and had access to a computer-based information package ; the information-only group received only the information package and was treated by st and ard physicians . All patients were offered the same evidence -based treatment options for FMS . Patients were assessed with question naires on physician-patient interaction ( main outcome criteria ) and decisional processes . Physicians filled out a question naire on interaction difficulties . Assessment took place immediately after the initial consultation . RESULTS Data from 85 FMS patients ( 44 in the SDM group and 41 in the information-only group ) were analyzed . The mean age was 49.9 years ( S.D.=10.2 ) , and 91.8 % of patients were female . The quality of physician-patient interaction was significantly higher in the SDM group than in the information-only group ( P<.001 ) . We found no differences in secondary outcome measures . CONCLUSIONS SDM with FMS patients might be a possible means to achieve a positive quality of physician-patient interaction . A specific SDM communication training program teaches physicians to perform SDM and reduces frustration in patients\", 'OBJECTIVE Evaluate tools to help pregnant women with prior cesareans make informed decisions about having trials of labor . DESIGN R and omized comparative trial . SETTING A research assistant with a laptop met the women in quiet locations at clinics and at health fairs . PARTICIPANTS Pregnant women ( N = 131 ) who had one prior cesarean and were eligible for vaginal birth after cesarean ( VBAC ) participated one time between 2005 and 2007 . METHODS Women were r and omized to receive either an evidence -based , interactive decision aid or two evidence -based educational brochures about cesarean delivery and VBAC . Effect on the decision-making process was assessed before and after the interventions . RESULTS Compared to baseline , women in both groups felt more informed ( F = 23.8 , p < .001 ) , were more clear about their birth priorities ( F = 9.7 , p = .002 ) , felt more supported ( F = 9.8 , p = .002 , and overall reported less conflict ( F = 18.1 , p < 0.001 ) after receiving either intervention . Women in their third trimesters reported greater clarity around birth priorities after using the interactive decision aid than women given brochures ( F = 9.8 , p = .003 ) . CONCLUSION Although both decision tools significantly reduced conflict around the birth decision compared to baseline , more work is needed to underst and which format , the interactive decision aid or paper brochures , are more effective early and late in pregnancy', \"Decision aids help patients make treatment choices . There is little empirical evidence to explain how they work . The results from this r and omised controlled trial comparing routine with decision-aided consultations in the prenatal diagnosis for Down 's syndrome context are used to describe the strategies employed during decision making , to assess the impact of a decision aid on decision processes , and to investigate decision process and outcome associations . Data were elicited from two content analyses of consultation transcripts and question naires assessing knowledge , anxiety , decisional conflict , reasons , and information usefulness .  68/106 women completed measures at consultation and follow-up . Decision-aided women employed more cognitive and emotional strategies during decision making . More negative evaluations during decision making were associated with better outcomes . Decision-aided consultations facilitated the employment of strategies associated with more effective choices . These consultations take longer and elicit greater expressions of negative affect , so may be less rewarding encounters for health professionals\", 'OBJECTIVE Screening reduces colorectal cancer ( CRC ) mortality and is cost-effective , yet uptake is suboptimal . We developed and evaluated a personally tailored interactive multimedia computer program ( IMCP ) to encourage CRC screening . METHODS R and omized controlled pilot trial evaluating the effects of the personally tailored CRC screening IMCP as compared with a non-tailored IMCP ( \" electronic leaflet \" ) control . The IMCP was tailored to patient preference , self-efficacy , barriers , and readiness and deployed in busy primary care offices before scheduled doctor visits . Main outcomes were : CRC screening knowledge , self-efficacy , benefits and barriers , and stage of readiness . RESULTS We enrolled 54 subjects ; software glitches occurred in 5 , leaving 49 subjects for analysis . In adjusted analyses , compared with control , the experimental group had a significant increase in CRC screening self-efficacy ( p=0.049 ) , a significantly greater likelihood of moving to a more advanced stage of readiness for screening ( p=0.034 ) , a trend toward fewer perceived barriers to screening ( p=0.149 ) , and no difference in perceived benefits or knowledge of screening . CONCLUSION Our personally tailored IMCP was significantly more effective than control in bolstering CRC screening readiness and self-efficacy . PRACTICE IMPLICATION S If further streamlined , personally tailored IMCPs might be usefully deployed in busy primary care offices to improve uptake of CRC screening', \"Abstract Objective : To assess the effect of leaflets on promoting informed choice in women using maternity services . Design : Cluster trial , with maternity units r and omised to use  leaflets  ( intervention units ) or offer usual care ( control units ) . Data collected through postal question naires . Setting : 13 maternity units in Wales . Participants : Four separate sample s of women using maternity services . Antenatal sample s : women reaching 28 weeks ' gestation before ( n=1386 ) and after ( n=1778 ) the intervention . Postnatal sample s : women at eight weeks after delivery before ( n=1741 ) and after ( n=1547 ) the intervention . Intervention : Provision of 10 pairs of Informed Choice leaflets for service users and midwives and a training session for staff in their use . Main outcome measures : Change in the proportion of women who reported exercising informed choice . Secondary outcomes : changes in women 's knowledge ; satisfaction with information , choice , and discussion ; and possible consequences of informed choice . Results : There was no change in the proportion of women who reported that they exercised informed choice in the intervention units compared with the control units for either antenatal or postnatal women . There was a small increase in satisfaction with information in the antenatal sample s in the intervention units compared with the control units ( odds ratio 1.40 , 95 % confidence interval 1.05 to 1.88 ) . Only three quarters of women in the intervention units reported being given at least one of the leaflets , indicating problems with the implementation of the intervention . Conclusion : In everyday practice , evidence based leaflets were not effective in promoting informed choice in women using maternity services\", 'AIMS Cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in people with diabetes in South Asia . The CARRS Translation Trial tests the effectiveness , cost-effectiveness , and sustainability of a clinic-based multi-component CVD risk reduction intervention among people with diabetes in India and Pakistan . METHODS We r and omly assigned 1146 adults with diabetes recruited from 10 urban clinic sites , to receive usual care by physicians or to receive an integrated multi-component CVD risk reduction intervention . The intervention involves electronic health record management , decision-support prompts to the healthcare team , and the support of a care coordinator to actively facilitate patient and provider adherence to evidence -based guidelines . The primary outcome is a composite of multiple CVD risk factor control ( blood glucose and either blood pressure or cholesterol , or all three ) . Other outcomes include control of the individual CVD risk factors , process and patient-centered measures , cost-effectiveness , and acceptability/feasibility . CONCLUSION The CARRS Translation Trial tests a low-cost diabetes care delivery model in urban South Asia to achieve comprehensive cardio-metabolic disease case-management of high-risk patients ( clinical trials.gov number : NCT01212328 )', 'RATIONALE , AIMS AND OBJECTIVES Frequent use and serious adverse effects related to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) underscore the need to raise patient awareness about potential risks . Partial success of patient- or provider-based interventions has recently led to interest in combined approaches focusing on both patient and physician . This research tested a shared decision-making intervention for increasing patient-reported awareness of NSAID risk . METHODS A group r and omized trial was performed in Alabama from 2005 to 2007 . Intervention group doctor practice s received continuing medical education ( CME ) about NSAIDs and patient activation tools promoting risk assessment and communication during visits . Comparison group doctor practice s received only CME . Cross-sectional data were collected before and after the intervention . Generalized linear latent and mixed models with logistic link tested relationships among the intervention , study phase , intervention by study phase interaction and patient-reported awareness of risks with either prescription or over-the-counter ( OTC ) NSAIDs . RESULTS Three hundred and forty-seven patients at baseline and 355 patients at follow-up participated in this study . The intervention [ adjusted odds ratio (AOR)=0.74 , P=0.248 ] , follow-up study phase ( AOR=1.31 , P=0.300 ) and intervention by study phase interaction ( AOR=0.98 , P=0.942 ) were not significantly associated with patient-reported awareness of any prescription NSAID risk . Follow-up study phase was associated with increased odds of reporting any OTC NSAID risk awareness ( AOR=2.99 , P<0.001 ) , but the patient activation intervention and intervention by study phase interaction were not significantly associated with patient-reported awareness of any OTC NSAID risk ( AOR=0.98 , P=0.929 ; AOR=0.87 , P=0.693 , respectively ) . CONCLUSIONS Our point-of-care intervention encouraging shared decision making did not increase NSAID risk awareness', \"BACKGROUND Women with a family history of breast cancer have several menopausal therapy options , including tamoxifen , hormone therapy ( HT ) , alternative medications , or no treatment . This complex decision should be based on each woman 's risk to develop breast cancer , menopausal symptoms , preferences , and risks for other conditions . The authors determined the effects of a personalized risk assessment and genetic counseling intervention on knowledge , risk perception , and decision making in a group of healthy women who had a first-degree relative with breast cancer . METHODS Forty-eight cancer-free menopausal women age > or = 40 years who had at least one first-degree relative with breast cancer were r and omized to a genetic counseling intervention or control .  Intervention participants were given a personalized risk assessment for breast cancer , heart disease , osteoporosis , and uterine cancer based on family history and personal health data . Knowledge , risk perception , and medication usage were measured at baseline , 1 month , and 6 months . RESULTS Knowledge was higher in the intervention group at both follow-up time points postintervention . Perceived risk for developing breast cancer was significantly lower and more accurate in the intervention group at 1 and 6 months postintervention than at baseline , as was perceived risk of developing heart disease . Although the counseling intervention did affect both knowledge and risk perception , overall , both groups were reluctant to take any form of menopausal therapy . CONCLUSIONS A personalized risk assessment and genetic counseling intervention improves patient knowledge and risk perception ; however , it is unclear that the intervention influenced menopausal treatment decisions\", 'OBJECTIVE To assess the impact of a decision aid on perceived risk of heart attacks and medication adherence among urban primary care patients with diabetes . METHODS We r and omly allocated 150 patients with diabetes to participate in a usual primary care visit either with or without the Statin Choice tool . Participants completed a question naire at baseline and telephone follow-up at 3 and 6 months . RESULTS Intervention patients were more likely to accurately perceive their underlying risk for a heart attack without taking a statin ( OR : 1.9 , CI : 1.0 - 3.8 ) and with taking a statin ( OR : 1.4 , CI : 0.7 - 2.8 ) ; a decline in risk overestimation among patients receiving the decision aid accounts for this finding . There was no difference in statin adherence at 3 or 6 months . CONCLUSION A decision aid about using statins to reduce coronary risk among patients with diabetes  improved risk communication , beliefs , and decisional conflict , but did not improve adherence to statins . PRACTICE IMPLICATION S Decision aid enhanced communication about the risks and benefits of statins improved patient risk perceptions but did not alter adherence among patients with diabetes', 'OBJECTIVE Decision-making at menopause remains a challenge for women and their health care providers as the paradigm for hormone therapy continues to evolve . The role of decision-support for this process remains to be defined . METHODS A r and omized controlled trial of a computer-based hormone therapy ( HT ) decision-aid versus a control intervention consisting of a printed pamphlet among 177 post-menopausal women receiving care in a Veterans Affairs Medical Center . RESULTS Participants found the computer-based decision-aid  easy to use and retained risk information incorporated from emerging scientific data . There was no difference between groups with respect to the primary outcomes of knowledge , satisfaction with decision , decisional conflict or HT use . A trend was reported towards decreased decisional conflict in the evidence in decision-making ( p=0.07 ) and factors of uncertainty ( p=0.06 ) domains among the subset of participants who were on HT at baseline and used the computer-based decision-aid . CONCLUSION The computer-based decision-aid was able to effectively incorporate emerging scientific information but was no more effective than a printed pamphlet control with regard to improving decision-process outcomes . PRACTICE IMPLICATION S The incremental benefit of a complex versus simpler decision-aid for post-menopausal women remains to be established prior to widespread dissemination of interactive computer-based HT decision-aids', 'Background Clinicians face challenges in promoting colorectal cancer screening due to multiple competing dem and s. A decision aid that clarifies patient preferences and improves decision quality can aid shared decision making and be effective at increasing colorectal cancer screening rates . However , exactly how such an intervention improves shared decision making is unclear . This study , funded by the National Cancer Institute , seeks to provide detailed underst and ing of how an interactive decision aid that elicits patient ’s risks and preferences impacts patient-clinician communication and shared decision making , and ultimately colorectal cancer screening adherence . Methods / Design This is a two-armed single-blinded r and omized controlled trial with the target of 300 patients per arm . The setting is eleven community and three academic primary care practice s in Metro Detroit . Patients are men and women aged between 50 and 75 years who are not up to date on colorectal cancer screening .  Colo DATE S Web ( intervention arm ) , a decision aid that incorporates interactive personal risk assessment and preference clarification tools , is compared to a non-interactive website that matches Colo DATE S Web in content but does not contain interactive tools ( control arm ) . Primary outcomes are patient uptake of colorectal cancer screening ; patient decision quality ( knowledge , preference clarification , intent ) ; clinician ’s degree of shared decision making ; and patient-clinician concordance in the screening test chosen . Secondary outcome incorporates a Structural Equation Modeling approach to underst and the mechanism of the causal pathway and test the validity of the proposed conceptual model based on Theory of Planned Behavior . Clinicians and those performing the analysis are blinded to arms . Discussion The central hypothesis is that Colo DATE S Web will improve colorectal cancer screening adherence through improvement in patient behavioral factors , shared decision making between the patient and the clinician , and concordance between the patient ’s and clinician ’s preferred colorectal cancer screening test . The results of this study will be among the first to examine the effect of a real-time preference assessment exercise on colorectal cancer screening and mediators , and , in doing so , will shed light on the patient-clinician communication and shared decision making ‘ black box ’ that currently exists between the delivery of decision aids to patients and subsequent patient behavior . Trial Registration Clinical Trials.gov ID', 'Introduction and aims : Professional societies recommend that the decision to screen for prostate cancer involves a shared discussion between patient and provider . Many men are tested without this discussion . Prostate cancer screening decision aids increase patient knowledge and participation in prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) testing decisions under ideal circumstances but are often re source intensive and elaborate . There is a need for evaluation of interventions that are low cost , low literacy , and practical for widespread distribution . The authors evaluated the effect of a mailed low-literacy informational patient flyer about the PSA test on measures of shared decision making . Methods : A pragmatic r and omized controlled trial comparing the mailed flyer versus usual care was conducted among 303 men aged 50 to 74 years who were scheduled for annual health maintenance exams in 2 general internal medicine clinics ( University of Colorado and University of Colorado Hospital ) . Charts were review ed after the visits for documentation of PSA screening discussion s and PSA testing rates . Follow-up patient surveys assessed include perceived participation in PSA screening decisions , knowledge of the PSA test , and flyer acceptability . Results : Rates of chart-documented PSA discussion s were low with no difference between the flyer and control groups ( 17.7 % and 13.6 % , respectively ; P = .28 ) . Rates of PSA testing were also similar in both groups ( 62.5 % vs 58.5 % ; P = .48 ) . Rates of patient-reported PSA discussion s were higher than the documented rates but also without differences between the groups ( 71.8 % vs 62.3 % ; P = .22 ) . The intervention had no effect in the PSA knowledge scores ( 3.5/5 vs 3.3/5 , P = .60 ) . Patients found the flyer to be highly acceptable . Conclusions : A mailed low-literacy informational flyer was well received by patients but had no effect on rates of PSA discussion s , PSA testing , or patient knowledge of prostate cancer screening', 'OBJECTIVE Compliance with antipsychotic medication is a major issue in schizophrenia treatment , and noncompliance with antipsychotic treatment is closely related to relapse and rehospitalization . An enhanced involvement of patients with schizophrenia in treatment decisions ( \" shared decision making \" ) is expected to improve long-term compliance and reduce rehospitalizations . The aim of the present analysis was to study whether shared decision making ( SDM ) in antipsychotic drug choice would influence long-term outcome . METHOD From February 2003 to January 2004 , psychiatric state hospital in patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia ( ICD-10 ; N = 107 ) were recruited for the trial using a cluster-r and omized controlled design . An SDM program on antipsychotic drug choice consisting of a decision aid and a planning talk between patient and physician was compared with routine care with respect to long-term compliance and rehospitalizations ( 6-month and 18-month follow-up ) . RESULTS On the whole , we found high rates of noncompliance and rehospitalization . There were no differences between intervention and control groups in the univariate analyses . However , when controlling for confounding factors in a multivariate analysis , there was a positive trend ( p = .08 ) that patients in the SDM intervention had fewer rehospitalizations . Additionally , a higher desire of the patient for autonomy and better knowledge at discharge were associated with higher hospitalization rates . CONCLUSION The intervention studied showed a positive trend but no clear beneficial effect on long-term outcomes . A more thorough implementation of SDM ( e.g. , iterative administration of decision aid ) might yield larger effects . Those patients with higher participation preferences are at higher risk for poor treatment outcomes and therefore require special attention . Strategies to match these patients \\' needs might improve compliance and long-term outcomes', \"OBJECTIVE This r and omized controlled trial aim ed to evaluate a decision aid for women with multiple sclerosis deciding whether to start or enlarge their families . METHOD Decision aid material s were mailed to participants , and their response material s returned by mail . One-hundred and ninety-four women with MS agreed to participate and were r and omized to receive the DA  or not . Participants completed question naires measuring decisional-conflict , self-efficacy , knowledge , depression and anxiety as well as their views regarding having children pre- and post-intervention . RESULTS Women who received the DA had a significant decrease in decisional-conflict , increase in self-efficacy and knowledge of MS and pregnancy and more certainty in their choice than those in the control group . There were no adverse effects on depression or anxiety and women 's decisions were not biased in either direction . CONCLUSION The DA is a useful tool that can be used by women with MS contemplating motherhood . PRACTICE IMPLICATION S This DA is used as a re source by the MS Society illustrating how DAs may help with lifestyle choices complicated by illness . It represents a tool adaptable to suit other illnesses where reproductive decision-making may be compromised and should be of interest to health-care professionals who are consulted by women with family-planning concerns\", \"OBJECTIVE To explore how effectively information presentation formats used in a patient decision aid  communicated the ability of a disease modifying anti-rheumatic drug to slow the rate of progression of rheumatoid arthritis related structural joint damage ( SJD ) . METHODS 91 first year psychology students and 91 RA patients participated in a prospect i ve r and omized , single blind , factorial experimental design evaluating the effect of four information formats on : satisfaction with risk communication , verbatim and gist recall of a hypothetical anti-rheumatic drug 's ability to slow the rate of progression of SJD . RESULTS Both groups underestimated the hypothetical drug 's ability to slow SJD . Formats that supported the narrative statement with a reinforcing graphic element result ed in recall closer to the true value . Comparison of the results from testing of RA patients and college students were remarkably similar across formats . CONCLUSION Rate of progression as communicated by narrative statement plus a graphic element ( i.e. speedometer metaphor or pictograph ) aided recall better than a narrative statement alone . Our results suggest that testing decision aid components with non- patients may provide data generalizable to patient population s. PRACTICE IMPLICATION S Graphics must be used carefully in patient decision aids as they can enhance recall , but may also introduce unintended recall bias\", \"CONTEXT As the availability of and dem and for genetic testing for hereditary cancers increases in primary care and other clinical setting s , alternative or adjunct educational methods to traditional genetic counseling will be needed . OBJECTIVE To compare the effectiveness of a computer-based decision aid with st and ard genetic counseling for educating women about BRCA1 and BRCA2 genetic testing . DESIGN R and omized controlled trial conducted from May 2000 to September 2002 . SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS Outpatient clinics offering cancer genetic counseling at 6 US medical centers enrolled 211 women with personal or family histories of breast cancer . INTERVENTIONS St and ard one-on-one genetic counseling ( n = 105 ) or education by a computer program followed by genetic counseling ( n = 106 ) . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Participants ' knowledge , risk perception , intention to undergo genetic testing , decisional conflict , satisfaction with decision , anxiety , and satisfaction with the intervention . Counselor group measures were administered at baseline and after counseling . Computer group measures were administered at baseline , after computer use , and after counseling . Testing decisions were assessed at 1 and 6 months . Outcomes were analyzed by high vs low risk of carrying a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation . RESULTS Both groups had comparable demographics , prior computer experience , medical literacy , and baseline knowledge  of breast cancer and  genetic testing , and both counseling and computer use were rated highly . Knowledge scores increased in both groups ( P<.001 ) regardless of risk status , and change in knowledge was greater in the computer group compared with the counselor group ( P = .03 ) among women at low risk of carrying a mutation . Perception of absolute risk of breast cancer decreased significantly after either intervention among all participants . Intention to undergo testing decreased significantly after either intervention among low-risk but not high-risk women . The counselor group had lower mean scores on a decisional conflict scale ( P = .04 ) and , in low-risk women , higher mean scores on a satisfaction-with-decision scale ( P = .001 ) . Mean state anxiety scores were reduced by counseling but were within normal ranges for both groups at baseline and after either intervention , regardless of risk status . CONCLUSIONS An interactive computer program was more effective than st and ard genetic counseling for increasing knowledge of breast cancer and genetic testing among women at low risk of carrying a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation . However , genetic counseling was more effective than the computer at reducing women 's anxiety and facilitating more accurate risk perceptions . These results suggest that this computer program has the potential to st and alone as an educational intervention for low-risk women but should be used as a supplement to genetic counseling for those at high risk\", 'Background : Too few patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation ( NVAF ) receive appropriate antithrombotic therapy . We tested the short-term ( primary outcome ) and long-term ( secondary outcome ) effect of a patient decision aid on the appropriateness of antithrombotic therapy among patients with NVAF . Methods : We conducted a cluster r and omized trial with blinded outcome assessment involving 434 NVAF patients from 102 community-based primary care practice s. Patients in the intervention group received a self-administered booklet and audiotape decision aid tailored to their personal stroke risk profile . Patients in the control group received usual care . The primary outcome measure was change in antithrombotic therapy at 3 months . Appropriateness of therapy was defined using the American College of Chest Physicians ( ACCP ) recommendations . Results : The mean patient age was 72 years , and the median duration of NVAF was 5 years . In the control group , there was a 3 % decrease over 3 months in the number of patients receiving therapy appropriate to their risk of stroke ( 40 % [ 85/215 ] at baseline v. 37 % [ 79/215 ] at 3 months ) . In the intervention group , the number of patients receiving therapy appropriate to their stroke risk increased by 9 % ( 32 % [ 69/219 ] at baseline v. 41 % [ 89/219 ] at 3 months ) . Although the proportion of patients whose therapy met the ACCP treatment recommendations did not differ between study arms at baseline ( p = 0.11 ) or 3 months ( p = 0.44 ) , there was a 12 % absolute improvement in the number of patients receiving appropriate care in the intervention group compared with the control group at 3 months ( p = 0.03 ) . The beneficial effect of the decision aid did not persist ( p = 0.44 for differences between study arms after 12 months ) . Interpretation : There was short-term improvement in the appropriateness of antithrombotic care among patients with NVAF who were exposed to a decision aid , but the improvement did not persist', \"OBJECTIVES : To pilot-test a visual aid developed to help counsel pregnant women . METHODS : After agreeing to participate , pregnant women at > 28 weeks of gestation were assigned r and omly to counseling with or without a visual aid . The visual aid contained pictures , graphics , and short messages about delivery room resuscitation , chances of survival , anticipated neonatal course , and long-term neurodevelopmental disabilities . A neonatal fellow performed counseling with a st and ardized script for an anticipated delivery at 23 weeks of gestation . In precounseling and postcounseling sessions , women were given a structured interview to assess their knowledge of chances of survival and disability and attitudes toward resuscitation . RESULTS : Of the 89 women who participated , 76 % were black and 59 % read below a 9th- grade level . Compared with the no – visual aid group , women in the visual aid group recalled more disabilities and predicted longer neonatal stays ( P = .01 ) . For both groups , mothers ' perceptions of the chances of survival were lower after counseling ; the decrease was greater in the visual aid group ( P = .03 ) . The majority of women in each group opted for resuscitation , which was not affected by counseling . In multivariate analyses , use of the visual aid was a significant independent factor in explaining before/after differences in survival chances and recall of a long NICU stay and number of disabilities ; higher literacy levels also were significant for recalling the number of disabilities . CONCLUSIONS : Use of a visual aid improved mothers '  knowledge and showed promise as a decision aid for counseling at the threshold of viability\", 'The decision to have bariatric surgery should be based on accurate information on possible risks and benefits of all treatment options . The goal of this study was to determine whether a video-based bariatric decision aid intervention results in superior decision quality compared to an educational booklet . We conducted a prospect i ve , r and omized controlled trial among adult patients in a single health plan who met st and ard criteria for bariatric surgery . Patients were r and omly assigned to review either a video-based decision aid ( intervention ) or an educational booklet on bariatric surgery ( control ) . Changes in patient decision quality were assessed using bariatric-specific measures of knowledge , values , and treatment preference after 3 months . Of 152 eligible participants , 75 were r and omly assigned to the intervention and 77 to the control . The 3-month follow-up rate was 95 % . Among all participants , significant improvements were observed in knowledge ( P < 0.001 ) , values concordance ( P = 0.009 ) , decisional conflict ( P < 0.001 ) , decisional self-efficacy ( P < 0.001 ) , and in the proportion who were \" unsure \" of their treatment choice ( P < 0.001 ) . The intervention group had larger improvements in knowledge ( P = 0.03 ) , decisional conflict ( P = 0.03 ) , and outcome expectancies ( P = 0.001 ) . The proportion of participants choosing bariatric surgery did not differ significantly between groups , although there was a trend toward decreased surgical choice in the intervention group ( 59 % booklet vs. 42 % video at 3 months ; P = 0.16 ) . The use of bariatric surgery decision aids was followed by improved decision quality and reduced uncertainty about treatment at 3 months . The video-based decision aid appeared to have a greater impact than the educational booklet on patient knowledge , decisional conflict , and outcome expectancies', 'Background Contrary to strong recommendations for high-dose intravenous corticosteroid treatment for relapses in multiple sclerosis ( MS ) , uncertainty remains about most aspects of relapse management . Oral corticosteroids administered by physicians or patients themselves or no corticosteroids also appear justifiable . Objective To evaluate an education program that aims to involve patients with MS in decisions on relapse management . Methods In three German MS centers , 150 patients with relapsing MS were r and omly assigned to a single , 4-h group session or a st and ard information leaflet . The primary outcome measure was the proportion of relapses with oral or no corticosteroid therapy  as an indicator of patient autonomy in treatment decision making . Other outcomes included perceived decision autonomy , quality of life , and disability status . Results In the intervention group ( IG ) , 108/139 ( 78 % ) relapses were treated with oral or no corticosteroids compared with 101/179 ( 56 % ) in the control group ; P < 0.0001 . Patients ’ perceived autonomy of treatment decision making was significantly higher in the IG ; P < 0.0001 . Quality of life , disability status , and adverse events of corticosteroid therapies were comparable . Conclusion The patient education program led to more autonomous decision making in patients with relapsing MS . Relevant changes in relapse management were observed', 'PURPOSE To evaluate a shared decision-making intervention ( SDMI ) for BRCA1/2 mutation carriers who have to make a choice between screening and prophylactic surgery for breasts and /or ovaries . PATIENTS AND METHODS The SDMI consisted of two value assessment sessions , using the time trade-off method , followed by individualized treatment information based on ( quality -adjusted ) life expectancy . After the baseline assessment ( 2 weeks after a positive DNA test result ) , women were r and omly assigned to the  SDMI group ( n = 44 ) , receiving the SDMI 2 months after the test result , or to the control group  ( n = 44 ) . The short- and long-term effects , 3 and 9 months after the test result , were assessed using question naires . Data were collected on well-being , treatment choice , and decision-related outcomes . RESULTS In the short term , the SDMI had no effect . In the long term , with respect to well-being , patients in the SDMI group had less intrusive thoughts ( P = .05 ) and better general health ( P = .01 ) and tended to be less depressed ( P = .07 ) . With respect to decision-related outcomes for the breasts , the SDMI group held stronger preferences ( P = .02 ) and agreed more strongly to having weighed the pros and cons ( P = .01 ) . No effect was found on treatment choice . In the long term , interaction effects between the SDMI and cancer history were found . The SDMI showed an overall beneficial effect for unaffected women , whereas affected women tended to experience detrimental effects . CONCLUSION We conclude that the SDMI improved decision making in unaffected BRCA1/2 mutation carriers . Supporting decision making in a systematic way using trade-offs is beneficial for these women', 'PURPOSE Breast cancer ( BC ) decision aid ( DA ) r and omized studies are limited to DA use in consultations among Western population s and for primary surgery . Their effectiveness beyond consultations , for reconstructive surgery and in other population s , has not been evaluated . We developed a DA administered after consultation for Chinese women deciding on BC surgery and , where relevant , immediate breast reconstruction , which was evaluated in this r and omized controlled trial ( RCT ) . PATIENTS AND METHODS Overall , 276 women considering BC surgery for early-stage BC were r and omly assigned to receive a DA ( take-home booklet ) or the st and ard information booklet ( control condition ) after the initial consultation , wherein surgeons disclosed the diagnosis and discussed treatment options with patients . Using block r and om assignment by week , 138 women were assigned to the DA arm and 138 to the control arm . Participants completed interview-based question naires 1 week after consultation and then 1 , 4 , and 10 months after surgery . Primary outcome measures were decisional conflict , decision-making difficulties , BC knowledge 1 week after consultation , and decision regret 1 month after surgery . Secondary outcome measures were treatment decision , decision regret 4 and 10 months after surgery , and postsurgical anxiety and depression . RESULTS The DA group reported significantly lower decisional conflict scores 1 week after consultation ( P = .016 ) compared with women in the control arm . Women receiving the DA had significantly lower decision regret scores 4 ( P = .026 ) and 10 months ( P = .014 ) after surgery and lower depression scores 10 months after surgery ( P = .001 ) . CONCLUSION This RCT demonstrated DAs may benefit Chinese patients in Hong Kong by reducing decisional conflict and subsequent regret and enhance clinical services for this population', 'OBJECTIVE We developed an evidence -based decision aid to help women with a prior cesarean to prioritize their childbirth preferences related to a future birth . Because there was uncertainty about which scale format would assist the patients in being most consistent in prioritizing preferences in a multiattribute decision model , we compared a graphic-numeric scale with a text-anchored scale . STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING Ninety-six postnatal women with a prior cesarean were r and omized to use 1 of 2  preference scale formats in a computerized childbirth decision aid . We measured the level of inconsistency ( intransitivity ) when patients prioritized their childbirth preferences and clarity of values before and after using the decision aid . RESULTS When the trade-offs involved risk , women were more consistent when using graphic-numeric than text-anchored formats ( P=0.015 ) . They prioritized safety to their baby as 4 times more important than any other decision factor including safety to self . Both groups reduced unclear childbirth values over time ( P<0.001 ) . Women who over-used the extreme ends of the scale when evaluating risk were more likely to be inconsistent ( P<0.001 ) . CONCLUSION Patients were more consistent in making trade-offs involving risk using graphic-numeric formats than text-anchored formats to measure patient preferences', 'Objective To determine whether a decision aid design ed for adults with low education and literacy can support informed choice and involvement in decisions about screening for bowel cancer . Design R and omised controlled trial . Setting Areas in New South Wales , Australia identified as socioeconomically disadvantaged ( low education attainment , high unemployment , and unskilled occupations ) . Participants 572 adults aged between 55 and 64 with low educational attainment , eligible for bowel cancer screening . Intervention Patient decision aid comprising a paper based interactive booklet ( with and without a question prompt list ) and a DVD , presenting quantitative risk information on the possible outcomes of screening using faecal occult blood testing compared with no testing . The control group received st and ard information developed for the Australian national bowel screening programme . All material s and a faecal occult blood test kit were posted directly to people ’s homes . Main outcome measures Informed choice ( adequate knowledge and consistency between attitudes and screening behaviour ) and preferences for involvement in screening decisions . Results Participants who received the decision aid showed higher levels of knowledge than the controls ; the mean score ( maximum score 12 ) for the decision aid group was 6.50 ( 95 % confidence interval 6.15 to 6.84 ) and for the control group was 4.10 ( 3.85 to 4.36 ; P<0.001 ) . Attitudes towards screening were less positive in the decision aid group , with 51 % of the participants expressing favourable attitudes compared with 65 % of participants in the control group ( 14 % difference , 95 % confidence interval 5 % to 23 % ; P=0.002 ) . The participation rate for screening was reduced in the decision aid group : completion of faecal occult blood testing was 59 % v 75 % in the control group ( 16 % difference , 8 % to 24 % ; P=0.001 ) . The decision aid increased the proportion of participants who made an informed choice , from 12 % in the control group to 34 % in the decision aid group ( 22 % difference , 15 % to 29 % ; P<0.001 ) . More participants in the decision aid group had no decisional conflict about the screening decision compared with the controls ( 51 % v 38 % ; P=0.02 ) . The groups did not differ for general anxiety or worry about bowel cancer . Conclusions Tailored decision support information can be effective in supporting informed choices and greater involvement in decisions about faecal occult blood testing among adults with low levels of education , without increasing anxiety or worry about developing bowel cancer . Using a decision aid to make an informed choice may , however , lead to lower uptake of screening . Trial registration Clinical Trials.gov NCT00765869 and Australian New Zeal and Clinical Trials Registry 12608000011381', 'PURPOSE Many clinicians lack re sources to engage patients in shared decision making for prostate cancer screening . We sought to evaluate whether previsit educational decision aids facilitate shared decision making . METHODS This r and omized controlled study compared a Web-based and a paper-based decision aid with no previsit education .  Men aged 50 to 70 years undergoing a health maintenance examination at a large family practice were enrolled . The primary outcome was patient-reported level of control over the decision to be screened . Secondary outcomes included frequency of screening , patient knowledge , decisional conflict , and time spent discussing screening . RESULTS A total of 497 men participated ( 75 control , 196 brochure , 226 Web site ) . Patients exposed to either aid were no more likely than control patients to report a collaborative decision : 36 % of patients in each group reported equally sharing decision responsibility . Exposure to either decision aid increased patients ’ involvement in decision making compared with the control condition ( Web site , P = .03 ; brochure , P = .03 ) . Only 46 % of control patients reported an active decision-making role , compared with 56 % of Web site and 54 % of brochure patients . Patients exposed to a decision aid answered a greater percentage of knowledge questions correctly ( 54 % control vs 69 % Web site , P < .001 , and vs 69 % brochure , P < .001 ) and were less likely to be screened ( 94 % control vs 86 % Web site , P = .06 , and vs 85 % brochure , P = .04 ) . CONCLUSIONS Patients in the decision aid groups were more informed and more engaged in the screening decision than their control counterparts . Exposure did not promote shared decision-making control , however . Whether shared decision making is the ideal model and how to measure its occurrence are subjects for further research', 'Purpose To measure the effectiveness of a tailored decision aid ( DA ) design ed to help women make informed decisions about genetic testing for breast/ovarian cancer risk . Methods A total of 145 women were r and omized to receive the  DA or a control pamphlet at the end of their first genetic counseling consultation . Of these , 120 ( 82.8 % ) completed two question naires , 1 week and 6 months post-consultation . Results While the DA had no effect on informed choice , post-decisional regret or actual genetic testing decision , the trial showed that women who received the DA had higher knowledge levels and felt more informed about genetic testing than women who received the control pamphlet ( χ2(2 ) = 6.82 ; P = 0.033 ; χ2(1 ) = 4.86 ; P = 0.028 respectively ) . The DA also helped women who did not have blood drawn at their first consultation to clarify their values with regards to genetic testing ( χ2(1 ) = 5.27 ; P = 0.022 ) . Women who received the DA were less likely to share the information with other family members than women in the control condition ( χ2(1 ) = 8.78 ; P = 0.003 ) . Conclusions Decision aids are an effective decision-support strategy for women considering genetic testing for breast/ovarian cancer risk , and are most effective before the patient has made a decision , which is generally at the point of having blood drawn', 'Objective : We sought to evaluate whether different presentation formats , presenter characteristics , and patient characteristics affect decision-making in asymptomatic carotid stenosis . Methods : Subjects included individuals presenting to a neurology clinic . Participants included those over age 18 without known carotid stenosis . Subjects were r and omized to a 30-second video with 1 of 5 presentation formats ( absolute risk , absolute event-free survival , annualized absolute risk , relative risk , and a qualitative description ) delivered by 1 of 4 presenter physicians ( black woman , white woman , black man , white man ) . Subjects then completed a one-page form regarding background demographics and their decision regarding treatment choice . Results : A total of 409 subjects watched the video and completed the survey . Overall , 48.4 % of subjects chose surgery . Presentation format strongly predicted choice of surgery ( qualitative [ 64 % ] , relative risk [ 63 % ] , absolute risk [ 43 % ] , absolute event-free survival [ 37 % ] , and annualized absolute risk [ 35 % ] , p < 0.001 ) . There was a trend for younger age ( mean age 52 vs 55 , p = 0.054 ) , male gender ( 53 % vs 45 % , p = 0.08 ) , and advanced education ( 42 % for high school education or less vs 52 % for more than high school education , p = 0.052 ) to predict surgery choice . Gender and race of presenter , and race of subject , had no influence on the choice of treatment . Conclusions : Presentation format ( information framing ) strongly determines patient decision-making in asymptomatic carotid stenosis . Subject age , gender , and education level may also influence the decision . Clinicians should consider the influence of these variables when counseling patients', \"Objective To evaluate the impact of a patient decision aid ( PDA ) regarding the use of natural health products ( NHPs ) at menopause on decisional conflict , knowledge of NHPs , congruence between values and choice , persistence with an option , intention to disclose the use of NHPs to a physician or a pharmacist and intention to use decision support interventions in the future . Study design A r and omized controlled trial in which 90 women , aged 45–64 years , facing a decision about using NHPs for menopausal symptoms , received a PDA ( experimental group ) or a general information brochure about menopause ( control group ) . Main outcome Decisional conflict . Measures Women were evaluated at baseline and after a two-week period using the decisional conflict scale ( DCS ) . Analysis of covariance was used to determine the differences between both groups on the DCS . Results Both groups experienced a statistically significant reduction on the DCS ( −0.55 ± 0.59 , P < 0.0001 versus −0.52 ± 0.73 , P < 0.0001 ) . However , there was no statistically significant difference between the groups ( P = 0.32 ) . Both groups experienced a statistically significant improvement in knowledge of NHPs ( 0.86 ± 1.77 , P = 0.002 versus 0.51 ± 1.47 , P = 0.031 ) . However , there was no statistically significant difference between the groups ( P = 0.162 ) . Conclusion A PDA regarding the use of NHPs for menopausal symptoms impacted favourably on women 's decisional conflict , but was not superior to a general information brochure on menopause\", 'OBJECTIVE Few studies have evaluated the end-of-life preferences of elderly patients in rural communities and whether preferences are associated with level of health literacy . DESIGN R and omized controlled trial of a goals -of-care video decision aid of advanced dementia . PARTICIPANTS Elderly subjects ( 65 years or older ) at a primary care clinic in rural Louisiana . METHODS Half of subjects heard a verbal description of advanced dementia and the goals of care ; the other half heard the same verbal description and then viewed the video decision aid . End points were the preferred goal of care in advanced dementia : life-prolonging care ( cardiopulmonary resuscitation [ CPR ] , etc . ) , limited care ( hospitalization but not CPR ) , or comfort care ( symptom relief ) . The principal category for analysis was the difference in proportions of subjects preferring comfort care for each characteristic including r and omization group and health literacy level . RESULTS Seventy-six subjects were r and omized to the verbal ( n = 43 ) or video ( n = 33 ) arms of the study . Among subjects receiving the verbal description of advanced dementia and the goals of care , 31 ( 72 % ) preferred comfort ; 5 ( 12 % ) chose limited ; and 7 ( 16 % ) desired life-prolonging . In the video group , 30 ( 91 % ) preferred comfort ; 3 ( 9 % ) chose limited ; and none desired life-prolonging ( χ(2 ) = 6.3 , df = 2 , p = 0.047 ) . Factors associated with greater likelihood of opting for comfort included greater health literacy ( unadjusted odds ratio [ OR ] 12.1 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 2.4 - 62.6 ) and r and omization to the video ( unadjusted OR 3.9 ; 95 % CI , 1.0 - 15.1 ) . CONCLUSION Rural subjects with higher health literacy were more likely to want comfort care compared to those with lower levels of health literacy . Furthermore , subjects who viewed a video decision aid were more likely to opt for comfort compared to those who solely listened to a verbal description . These findings suggest that video can help elicit preferences and that interventions to empower such patients need to be design ed in a manner that is sensitive to health literacy', 'BACKGROUND We report on the development and initial evaluation of a novel computerized decision support system ( CDSS ) that utilizes concepts from entertainment education ( edutainment ) to assist low-literate , multiethnic women in making initial surgical treatment decisions . METHOD We r and omly assigned 51 patients diagnosed with early stage breast cancer to use the decision aid . RESULTS Patients who viewed the CDSS improved their knowledge of breast cancer treatment ; found the application easy to use and underst and , informative , and enjoyable ; and were less worried about treatment . CONCLUSION The system clearly reached its intended objectives to create a usable decision aid for low-literate , novice computer users', \"Objective To assess the effects of different approaches to decision‐making on the treatment chosen for prostate cancer and on the patients ' quality of life in prostate cancer\", \"OBJECTIVE To evaluate decision analysis as a technique to facilitate women 's decision-making about prenatal diagnosis for Down syndrome using measures of effective decision-making . DESIGN R and omised controlled trial in a UK hospital 's prenatal diagnosis clinic . INTERVENTION Routine versus routine consultation structured by decision analysis . PARTICIPANTS 117/132 women receiving a screen-positive maternal serum screening result participated ( 58 routine , 59 decision analysis ) . METHODS Consultations were audio tape-recorded , transcribed and coded ; question naires were completed after the consultation and one month later after receipt of a diagnostic test and /or the 19-week scan result . MAIN MEASURES Test decision , subjective expected utilities , knowledge , informed decision-making , risk perception , decisional conflict , anxiety , perceived usefulness and directiveness of consultation information . RESULTS 48/59 in the decision-aided group and 47/58 in the routine group underwent prenatal diagnosis . Informed decision-making was higher , perceived risk more realistic and decisional conflict over time lower in the decision analysis group . Decision analysis had no impact on knowledge or SEU scores , and was no more or no less directive , useful or anxiety provoking than the routine care . Consultations were six minutes longer . CONCLUSIONS Decision analysis consultations enable women to make more informed prenatal diagnosis decisions . Professionals will need training to use this technique effectively\", 'OBJECTIVE Studies have shown that patients with knee pain are not well informed of their potential treatment options and that patient preferences are often discordant with physician practice s. The objective of this pilot study was to test the efficacy of a computer tool to improve informed decision-making for patients with knee pain in an outpatient primary care clinic setting . METHODS Patients with knee pain were r and omized to receive an information pamphlet or to perform a computer task . The latter was design ed to elicit preferences based on patient tradeoffs for route of administration , benefits , and side effects of commonly used treatment options for knee pain . After performing the task , participants were given a printed h and out illustrating their preferences . RESULTS In total , 87 patients were r and omized .  Decisional self-efficacy , preparedness to participate in decision-making , and arthritis self-efficacy were greater in participants r and omized to the intervention arm compared to those receiving the information pamphlet ( p < 0.05 for all comparisons ) . CONCLUSION Participants using a tool design ed to increase patient awareness of choice and evaluate the tradeoffs related to available treatment options were more confident in their ability to obtain information about available treatment options , were better prepared to participate in their visit , and had better arthritis related self-efficacy compared to patients receiving an information pamphlet . The results of this pilot study justify future large-scale trials to determine the effectiveness of similar interventions', \"CONTEXT The long-term results of r and omized trials have demonstrated equivalent survival rates for mastectomy and breast-conserving therapy for the treatment of early stage breast cancer . Consequently , the choice of treatment should be based on a patient 's preferences . OBJECTIVE To evaluate the impact of a decision aid regarding the different surgical treatment options on patient decision making . DESIGN AND SETTING A cluster r and omized trial for which general surgeons in the communities of central -west , and eastern Ontario , Canada , were r and omly assigned to use the decision aid or not in the surgical consultation . Patients received the decision aid or not based on the surgeon seen . PARTICIPANTS Twenty surgeons participated in the study . Of the 208 eligible women with newly diagnosed clinical stage I or II breast cancer seen by study surgeons , 201 agreed to be evaluated : 94 were assigned to the decision board and 107 to usual practice . Patients were recruited from November 1999 to April 2002 . INTERVENTION The decision board is a decision aid design ed to help physicians inform their patients about different treatment options and to enable patients to express a preference for treatment . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Patient knowledge about the surgical treatment of breast cancer ; decisional conflict ; satisfaction with decision making ; and the treatment decision following the consultation . RESULTS Patients in the decision board group had higher knowledge scores about their treatment options ( 66.9 vs 58.7 ; P<.001 ) , had less decisional conflict ( 1.40 vs 1.62 , P = .02 ) , and were more satisfied with decision making ( 4.50 vs 4.32 , P = .05 ) following the consultation . Patients who used the decision board were more likely to choose BCT ( 94 % vs 76 % , P = .03 ) . CONCLUSIONS The decision board was helpful in improving communication and enabling women to make a choice regarding treatment . Such instruments should be considered by surgeons when communicating the different surgical options to women with breast cancer\", \"OBJECTIVE Does a patient information booklet influence treatment for menorrhagia ? DESIGN R and omized trial and a pre-trial prospect i ve cohort study . SETTING Gynaecology outpatient clinics in 14 Finnish hospitals . PARTICIPANTS A total of 363 ( r and omized trial ) plus 206 ( cohort study ) patients with menorrhagia . INTERVENTION An information booklet about menorrhagia and treatment options , mailed before the first visit to the outpatient clinic . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Distribution of treatment modalities , knowledge about treatment options , satisfaction with communication with personnel and anxiety . RESULTS Treatment decision within 3 months was made more often in the intervention group than in the control group ( 96 % and 89 % respectively , P = 0.02 ) . Oral medication was more frequently chosen , and newly introduced treatments ( minor surgery , hormonal intrauterine system ) were less frequently used in the intervention group ( at 3-month follow-up 21 % and 29 % , respectively ) . The differences persisted at the 12-month follow-up . In the pre-trial group , new treatment methods were less frequently chosen and used than in the control group . Additional information did not increase the number of surgical procedures used , improve knowledge , or influence satisfaction or anxiety . CONCLUSIONS Additional information led to an increase in specific treatment decisions and changed the distribution of used treatments without increasing the number of surgical procedures . The study suggests that well-informed women adopting an active role may counteract physicians ' emphasis on newly introduced treatments\", 'Purpose The informed consent is a legal requirement prior to surgery and should be based on an extensive preoperative interview . Multimedia productions can therefore be utilised as supporting tool . In a prospect i ve r and omised trial , we evaluated the impact of an extended education on patients undergoing cholecystectomy . Material s and methods For extended patient information , a professionally built DVD was used . After r and omisation to either the DVD or the control group , patients were informed with or without additional presentation of the DVD . The quality of education was evaluated using a purpose -built question naire . Results One hundred fourteen patients were included in the DVD and 98 in the control group .  Patient characteristics did not differ significantly despite a higher educational level in the DVD group . The score of correctly answered questions was higher in the DVD group ( 19.88 vs. 17.58 points , p < 0.001 ) . As subgroup analysis revealed , particular patient characteristics additionally impacted on results . Conclusion Patients should be informed the most extensively prior to any surgical procedure . Multimedia productions therefore offer a suitable instrument . In the presented study , we could prove the positive impact of an information DVD on patients knowledge . Nevertheless , multimedia tools can not replace personal interaction and should only be used to support daily work', \"An intervention was developed to increase patient involvement in care . Using a treatment algorithm as a guide , patients were helped to read their medical record and coached to ask questions and negotiate medical decisions with their physicians during a 20-minute session before their regularly scheduled visit . In a r and omized controlled trial we compared this intervention with a st and ard educational session of equal length in a clinic for patients with ulcer disease . Six to eight weeks after the trial , patients in the experimental group reported fewer limitations in physical and role-related activities ( p less than 0.05 ) , preferred a more active role in medical decision-making , and were as satisfied with their care as the control group . Analysis of audiotapes of physician-patient interactions showed that patients in the experimental group were twice as effective as control patients in obtaining information from physicians ( p less than 0.05 ) . Results of the intervention included increased involvement in the interaction with the physician , fewer limitations imposed by the disease on patients ' functional ability , and increased preference for active involvement in medical decision-making\", 'BACKGROUND This study was a r and omized trial to test the impact of an informed decision-making intervention on prostate cancer screening use . METHODS The study population included 242 African-American men from three primary care practice s who were 40 - 69 years of age and had no history of prostate cancer . Participants completed a baseline survey question naire and were r and omly assigned either to a St and ard Intervention ( SI ) group ( N=121 ) or an Enhanced Intervention ( EI ) group ( N=121 ) . An informational booklet was mailed to both groups . EI group men were also offered a screening decision education session . Two outcomes were considered : ( 1 ) complete screening ( i.e. , having a digital rectal exam ( DRE ) and prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) testing ) , and ( 2 ) complete or partial screening ( i.e. , having a PSA test with or without DRE ) . An endpoint chart audit was performed six months after initial intervention contact . The data were analyzed via exact logistic regression . RESULTS Overall , screening use was low among study participants . EI group men had a screening frequency two times greater than that of SI group men , but the difference was not statistically significant : 8 % vs. 4 % ( OR = 1.94 ) fo rcomplete screening , and 19 % vs. 10 % ( OR = 2.08 ) for complete or partial screening . Multivariable analyses showed that being in the EI group and primary care practice were significant predictors of complete or partial screening ( OR = 3.9 and OR = 5.64 , respectively ) . CONCLUSION Prostate cancer screening use may be influenced by exposure to decision education and the influence of screening-related primary care practice factors', \"BACKGROUND Little is known about what information affects men 's decisions about prostate cancer screening . METHODS We developed a four-part decision aid about  prostate cancer screening and tested it in men , ages 45 - 85 , to determine how the information in each part--(1 ) the epidemiology of prostate cancer ; ( 2 ) the PSA test ; ( 3 ) prostate biopsy and treatment options for prostate cancer ; and ( 4 ) balance sheets to aid decision-making -- affected men 's interest in screening . RESULTS One hundred eighty-eight men from one general internal medicine clinic participated in our study ( response rate 65 % ) . Before the decision aid , 76 % were interested in screening ; 8 % were not ; and 16 % were undecided . The decision aid increased the proportion of men who knew the advantages ( + 28 % ; 95 % CI : 21 - 35 ) and disadvantages ( + 55 % ; 95 % CI : 48 - 63 % ) of screening . It also increased the proportion who knew enough to make a decision ( + 24 ; 95 % CI : 16 - 32 % ) . It did not change men 's interest in screening ( P = 0.134 ) . Twenty percent of men , however , did change their interest category . Men who were undecided at baseline were more likely to change than those who were interested or not interested . There were no clinical ly meaningful changes in interest following each component part of the decision aid . CONCLUSION Interest in prostate cancer screening is high and remained high after a 10 min decision aid . The decision aid increased the proportion of men with sufficient information to decide about screening . It also changed 20 % of men 's interest in screening . Because no single piece of information was influential to decision-making in all men , clinicians may want to tailor information to men 's individual needs\", \"BACKGROUND From 2010 onward , a new leaflet about mammography screening for breast cancer , more informative than the preceding version , has been sent to women in Germany aged 50 to 69 with the invitation to undergo screening . The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of different informational content on the decision whether or not to be screened . METHODS In a r and omized and blinded design , 792 women aged 48 to 49 were sent either the old or the new leaflet . Question naires were sent together with the leaflets in order to assess the following : willingness to undergo mammography screening , knowledge , decisional confidence , personal experiences of breast cancer , and demographic data . RESULTS 370 ( 46.7 % ) of the question naires were returned , and 353 were evaluable . The two groups did not differ significantly in their willingness to be screened : 81.5 % ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 75.8%-87.2 % ) versus 88.6 % ( 95 % CI 83.9%-91.3 % , p = 0.060 ) . A post-hoc analysis showed that women who reported having had personal experience of breast cancer ( 18.7 % ) were more willing to be screened if they were given the new leaflet , rather than the old one ( interaction p = 0.014 ) . The two groups did not differ in their knowledge about screening ( p = 0.260 ) . Women who received the old leaflet reported a higher decisional confidence ( p = 0.017 ) . The most commonly mentioned factors affecting the decision were experience of breast cancer in relatives and close acquaintances ( 26.5 % of mentions ) and a doctor 's recommendation ( 48.2 % ) . Leaflets ( 3.6 % ) and all other factors played only a secondary role . CONCLUSION The greater or lesser informativeness of the leaflet affected neither the participants ' knowledge of mammography screening nor their willingness to undergo it . The leaflet was not seen as an aid to decision-making . The best way to assure an informed decision about screening may be for the patient to discuss the matter personally with a qualified professional\", 'Objective . Oncology patients often seek involvement in their medical consultations . Such involvement is endorsed by most health care providers and mirrored in practice guidelines . However , oncologists exhibit great variation in how they provide patients with disease-relevant information , and many remain reluctant to do so at all . The authors examined the impact of a patient-specific decision aid on women ’s decisions about adjuvant therapy for breast cancer . Method . 386 women with breast cancer were r and omized to receive either an informational pamphlet about adjuvant therapy ( usual care ) or a patient-specific , evidence -based decision aid about adjuvant therapy . The authors compared rates of adjuvant therapy between the groups controlling for age , education , marital status , race , tumor severity , and practice type of their physician ( university-based or community-based ) . Results . Among women with low tumor severity , only 58 % ( 35/60 ) of women in the decision aid group chose adjuvant therapy  , compared to 87 % ( 33/38 ) of their counterparts in usual care ( P < 0.01 ) . Conclusions . This study illustrates the important impact of medical decision aids on treatment choices , particularly for patients for whom treatment has little benefit . In the case of adjuvant therapy for breast cancer , providing individualized , evidence -based risk information for shared decision making result ed in fewer women with low tumor severity choosing adjuvant treatment', \"Introduction Tamoxifen and raloxifene are chemopreventive drugs that can reduce women 's relative risk of primary breast cancer by 50 % ; however , most women eligible for these drugs have chosen not to take them . The reasons for low uptake may be related to women 's knowledge or attitudes towards the drugs . We aim ed to examine the impact of an online breast cancer chemoprevention decision aid ( DA ) on informed intentions and decisions of women at high risk of breast cancer . Methods We conducted a r and omized clinical trial , assessing the effect of a DA about breast cancer chemoprevention on informed choices about chemoprevention . Women ( n = 585 ) , 46- to 74-years old old , completed online baseline , post-test , and three-month follow-up question naires . Participants were r and omly assigned to either an intervention group , a st and ard control group that answered questions about chemoprevention at baseline , or a three-month control group that did not answer questions about chemoprevention at baseline . The main outcome measures were whether women 's intentions and decisions regarding chemoprevention drugs were informed , and whether women who viewed the DA were more likely to make informed decisions than women who did not view the DA , using a dichotomous composite variable ' informed choice ' ( yes/no ) to classify informed decisions as those reflecting sufficient knowledge and concordance between a woman 's decision and relevant attitudes . Results Analyses showed that more intervention than st and ard control participants ( 52.7 % versus 5.9 % ) made informed decisions at post-test , P < 0.001 . At the three-month follow-up , differences in rates of informed choice between intervention ( 16.9 % ) and both control groups ( 11.8 % and 8.0 % ) were statistically non-significant , P = 0.067 . Conclusions The DA increased informed decision making about breast cancer chemoprevention , although the impact on knowledge diminished over time . This study was not design ed to determine how much knowledge decision makers must retain over time . Examining informed decisions increases underst and ing of the impact of DAs . A st and ard for defining and measuring sufficient knowledge for informed decisions is needed . Trial registration Clinical Trials.gov :\", \"STUDY QUESTION What is the relationship between the rate of elective single-embryo transfer ( eSET ) and couples ' exposure to different elements of a multifaceted implementation strategy ? SUMMARY ANSWER Additional elements in a multifaceted implementation strategy do not result in an increased eSET rate . WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY A multifaceted eSET implementation strategy with four different elements is effective in increasing the eSET rate by 11 % . It is unclear whether every strategy element contributes equally to the strategy 's effectiveness . STUDY DESIGN AND SIZE An observational study was performed among 222 subfertile couples included in a previously performed r and omized controlled trial . PARTICIPANTS , SETTING S AND METHODS Of the 222 subfertile couples included , 109 couples received the implementation strategy and 113 couples received st and ard IVF care .  A multivariate regression analysis assessed the effectiveness of four different strategy elements on the decision about the number embryos to be transferred . Question naires evaluated the experiences of couples with the different elements . MAIN RESULTS AND ROLE OF CHANCE Of the couples who received the implementation strategy , almost 50 % ( 52/109 ) were exposed to all the four elements of the strategy . The remaining 57 couples who received two or three elements of the strategy could be divided into two further classes of exposure . Our analysis demonstrated that additional elements do not result in an increased eSET rate . In addition to the physician 's advice , couples rated a decision aid and a counselling session as more important for their decision to transfer one or two embryos , compared with a phone call and a reimbursement offer ( P < 0.001 ) . LIMITATIONS AND REASONS FOR CAUTION The differences in eSET rate between exposure groups failed to reach significance , probably because of the small numbers of couples in each exposure group . WIDER IMPLICATION S OF THE FINDINGS Adding more elements to an implementation strategy does not always result in an increased effectiveness , which is in concordance with recent literature . This in-depth evaluation of a multifaceted intervention strategy could therefore help to modify strategies , by making them more effective and less expensive\", \"OBJECTIVE Decision aids are design ed to assist patients in underst and ing their health care choices but lower SES population s are less activated and may not be prepared to benefit . Activating interventions may help prepare patients for using decision aids . METHODS We evaluated the impact of a decision aid video ( DA ) and the Patient Activation Intervention ( PAI ) on patient 's level of activation measured by the Patient Activation Measure ( PAM ) and their decision-making confidence measured by the decision self-efficacy ( DSE ) scale .  Patients were r and omized into control , PAI alone , DA alone , and DA+PAI groups . RESULTS PAM and DSE scores increased significantly in all groups with repeated measures . Restricting analyses to those with pre-intervention PAM scores at stages 1 or 2 , the change in PAM scores was significant only for the intervention groups . The change in DSE scores was significantly only in the DA group . CONCLUSION These findings provide support for the utility of the DA , the PAI , and the DA+PAI in activating lower SES individuals . The DA alone changed DSE scores in the least activated patients while the PAI and DA both changed PAM scores . PRACTICE IMPLICATION S Interventions directed at increasing patient engagement in their care may be useful particularly for less activated patients from lower SES population\", \"BACKGROUND Studies have shown that telephone interventions design ed to promote patients ' self-management skills and improve patient-physician communication can increase patients ' satisfaction and their use of preventive services . The effect of such a strategy on health care costs remains controversial . METHODS We conducted a stratified , r and omized study of 174,120 subjects to assess the effect of a telephone-based care-management strategy on medical costs and re source utilization . Health coaches contacted subjects with selected medical conditions and predicted high health care costs to instruct them about shared decision making , self-care , and behavioral change . The subjects were r and omly assigned to either a usual-support group or an enhanced-support group . Although the same telephone intervention was delivered to the two groups , a greater number of subjects in the enhanced-support group were made eligible for coaching through the lowering of cutoff points for predicted future costs and expansion of the number of qualifying health conditions . Primary outcome measures at 1 year were total medical costs and number of hospital admissions . RESULTS At baseline , medical costs and re source utilization were similar in the two groups . After 12 months , 10.4 % of the enhanced-support group and 3.7 % of the usual-support group received the telephone intervention . The average monthly medical and pharmacy costs per person in the enhanced-support group were 3.6 % ( $ 7.96 ) lower than those in the usual-support group ( $ 213.82 vs. $ 221.78 , P=0.05 ) ; a 10.1 % reduction in annual hospital admissions ( P<0.001 ) accounted for the majority of savings . The cost of this intervention program was less than $ 2.00 per person per month . CONCLUSIONS A targeted telephone care-management program was successful in reducing medical costs and hospitalizations in this population -based study . ( Funded by Health Dialog Services ; Clinical Trials.gov number , NCT00793260 .\", \"OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to evaluate the patients ' perception of the usefulness of a question prompt sheet ( QPS ) in facilitating the involvement of advanced cancer patients during consultation . METHODS Advanced cancer patients attending their first consultation after diagnosis were r and omly assigned to the intervention group ( received QPS and a hospital introduction sheet ( HIS ) ) or the control group ( received HIS only ) . Analysis was conducted on an intention-to-treat basis . The primary outcome measure was patient rating of the usefulness of the material ( s ) ( numerical rating scale of 0 - 10 ) . RESULTS Sixty-three advanced cancer patients ( 72.4 % response rate ) were enrolled and analyzed . Nearly three-quarters of patients in both groups read the material ( s ) before consultation . The rated usefulness of the material ( s ) for asking questions of physicians was significantly higher in the intervention group than in controls ( 4.4 ± 3.6 and 2.7 ± 2.8 , respectively ; p = 0.033 ) . The mean score of the usefulness of the material ( s ) for underst and ing the treatment plan tended to be higher in the intervention group than in the controls ( 4.9 ± 3.6 and 3.3 ± 2.8 ; p = 0.051 ) . The mean score of willingness to use the material ( s ) in the future was significantly higher in the intervention group than in the controls ( 5.3 ± 3.8 and 2.8 ± 2.8 ; p = 0.006 ) . There were no significant differences between the groups in the average total number of questions asked by patients ( median , 1.0 ; interquartile range in both groups , 2.0 ) . CONCLUSIONS QPS provided before oncology consultation may be useful for advanced cancer patients , on the other h and , it did not directly promote patient confidence to ask questions\", 'AIMS Most smokers attempt to stop smoking without using help . We evaluated the efficacy of a decision aid to motivate quitters to use  efficacious treatment .  SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS , A total of 1,014 were recruited from a convenience sample of 3,391 smokers who intended to quit smoking within 6 months . DESIGN AND Smokers were assigned r and omly to either receive the decision aid or no intervention . The decision aid was expected to motivate quitters to use efficacious cessation methods and contained neutral information on treatment methods , distinguishing between efficacious and non-efficacious treatments . MEASUREMENTS Baseline question naire and follow-ups were used 2 weeks and 6 months after the start of the intervention . FINDINGS The decision aid increased knowledge of cessation methods and induced a more positive attitude towards these methods . Furthermore , 45 % reported increased confidence about being able to quit and 43 % said it helped them to choose between treatments . However , no clear effect on usage of treatment aids was found , but the intervention group had more quit attempts ( OR=1.52 , 95 % CI 1.14 - 2.02 ) and higher point prevalence abstinence at 6-month follow-up ( 20.2 % versus 13.6 % ; OR=1.51 , 95 % CI=1.07 - 2.11 ) . CONCLUSIONS An aid to help smokers decide to use efficacious treatment when attempting to quit smoking had a positive effect on smoking cessation , while failing to increase the usage of efficacious treatment . This finding lends support to the notion that the mere promotion of efficacious treatments for tobacco addiction might increase the number of quit attempts , irrespective of the actual usage of treatment', \"As genetic testing for susceptibility to breast cancer becomes more widespread , alternative methods for educating individuals prior to testing will be needed . Our objective was to compare face-to-face education and counseling by a genetic counselor with education by an interactive computer program , assessing the effects of each on knowledge of breast cancer genetics and intent to undergo genetic testing . We used a r and omized , controlled trial . Seventy-two self-referred women with a first-degree relative with breast cancer received outpatient education and counseling at the Clinical Center of the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) . Twenty-nine received individualized counseling from a genetic counselor ( counseling group ) , 29 received education from an interactive computer program followed by individualized counseling ( computer group ) , and 14 were controls . Both pre- and postintervention assessment of knowledge about breast cancer genetics and intent to undergo genetic testing were measured . The control group participants correctly answered 74 % of the knowledge questions ; the counselor group , 92 % ; and the computer group , 96 % ( P < .0001 ) . Unadjusted mean knowledge scores were significantly higher in the computer group than the counselor group ( P = .048 ) , but they were equivalent when adjusted for demographic differences ( P = 0.34 ) . Intent to undergo genetic testing was influenced by the interventions : preintervention , a majority in all groups ( 69 % ) indicated that they were likely ( definitely and most likely ) to undergo testing ; after either intervention coupled with counseling , only 44 % indicated that they were likely to do so ( P = .0002 ; odds ratio = 2.8 , 95 % CI = 1.7 - 4.9 ) . We concluded that a computer program can successfully educate patients about breast cancer susceptibility , and , along with genetic counseling , can influence patients ' intentions to undergo genetic testing\", \"OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effectiveness of a web-based , individually tailored decision aid ( Patient Dialogue ) on depression or acute low back pain for insurees of a German sickness fund . METHODS Patient Dialogue ( PD ) was compared to the non-tailored Static Patient Information ( SPI ) in an online r and omized controlled trial ( RCT ) . The primary outcome was decisional conflict ; secondary outcomes included knowledge , preparation for decision-making , preference for participation , involvement in decision-making , decision regret , and adherence . RESULTS Out of 2480 r and omized participants , 657 ( 26.5 % ) provided analyzable data immediately after using the system . Three months later , data from 131 ( 5.3 % ) participants could be included in the analysis . The PD group reported a significantly lower overall decisional conflict than the SPI group ( 38.7 vs. 45.1 ; p=0.028 via multiple imputation estimator ) . The largest st and ardized effect ( Cohen 's d 0.56 ) result ed from the preparation for decision-making ( PD 59.4 vs. SPI 46.8 ; p<0.001 ) . CONCLUSION PD may be an effective tool to reduce decisional conflict and prepare participants for treatment decision-making . However , the large dropout rate needs to be taken into account . PRACTICE IMPLICATION S This study shows how a health insurance fund can support shared decision-making and how a decision aid can be evaluated in a RCT under routine care conditions\", 'OBJECTIVE Despite the burden of colorectal cancer and improved health care outcomes with early detection and treatment , screening rates among eligible adults are low . We previously developed through a series of studies an interactive electronic tool , Colorectal Web , to promote colorectal cancer screening . METHOD From May 2002 to December 2003 , we conducted a r and omized controlled trial of Colorectal Web compared to a st and ard Web site on colorectal cancer screening in urban , suburban , and rural communities in Michigan with high colorectal cancer burden . Study participants were age 50 years and older , with no previous colorectal cancer screening . Major outcome was screened for colorectal cancer by 24 weeks post-intervention . RESULTS 174 eligible adults were r and omized and participated . Immediately post-intervention , Colorectal Web participants were significantly more likely to have a preferred colorectal cancer screening method , but this difference did not persist at subsequent follow-up . Eighty-nine participants had been screened for colorectal cancer by 24 weeks post-intervention . The probability of being screened for the Colorectal Web intervention study arm compared to the control is OR=3.23 ( 2.73 - 3.50 95 % Confidence Interval ) . CONCLUSION Colorectal Web is more effective than a st and ard colorectal cancer Web site at prompting previously unscreened individuals to choose a preferred colorectal cancer screening test and to be screened for colorectal cancer', 'BACKGROUND Patient preference for the choice of treatment modality for prostate cancer has increasingly gained attention . OBJECTIVE To assess the impact of client-oriented decision on long-term mortality , disease progression and biochemical failure compared with st and ard treatment protocol ( TP ) . METHODS With data from a Finnish multicentre , r and omized controlled trial with two arms [ 104 in the enhanced patient participation ( EPP ) arm and 106 in the TP arm ] , disease-specific and disease-free survival , biochemical failure with elevated prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) level and disease progression were compared between the two arms using Wilcoxon test and also Cox proportional hazards regression model . RESULTS Patients in the EPP arm had a higher risk of death by 37 % [ HR , 1.37 ( 0.87 - 2.17 ) ] compared with those in the TP arm . Patients in the EPP arm were at increased risk of having biochemical failure by 14 % [ HR , 1.14 ( 0.72 - 1.79 ) ] and for having disease progression by 2 % [ HR , 1.02 ( 0.61 - 1.70 ) ] compared with those in the TP arm . All the differences were non-significant . CONCLUSIONS Patients actively involved in the choice of treatment had higher risk of prostate cancer death but only slightly increased risk of biochemical failure and clinical disease progression . These findings would provide a good reference when patient autonomy for the choice of treatment modality is addressed', \"OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to determine whether an interactive computer program could improve patient knowledge regarding genetic screening and diagnostic concepts . METHODS In this r and omized trial , women 6 - 26 weeks ' gestation were assigned to st and ard care with provider-based counseling or to augmented counseling with an interactive computer program . The computer-based tool conveyed information about genetic testing options . Women were administered a 23-item test of content knowledge immediately and 2 - 4 weeks after exposure . Test scores were compared between groups at both points using T-tests . RESULTS A total of 150 women were r and omized equally between groups . Groups were similar with regard to demographic characteristics . Women r and omized to the interactive tool correctly answered a significantly greater proportion of questions than those who received st and ard counseling ( 69.4 % ± 14.2 % vs. 46.0 % ± 15.2 % , p < 0.001 ) on the immediate question naire . One hundred and twenty-three ( 82 % ) participants participated in the follow-up test . Women r and omized to the tool continued to correctly answer a significantly greater proportion of questions ( 60.6 % ± 16 % vs. 49.7 % ± 18.9 % , p = 0.001 ) . Education , health literacy , electronic health literacy , and other discussion s with providers were not associated with a differential benefit from the educational intervention . CONCLUSION A patient-directed interactive computer program may help providers to convey relevant information about genetic screening and diagnostic concepts\", \"Screening with fecal occult blood testing ( FOBT ) or sigmoidoscopy has been shown to reduce mortality rates from colon cancer ( 1 ) . Although consensus among policy-making bodies in the United States is that colon cancer screening should be recommended for adults older than 50 years of age ( 1 - 3 ) , a national population -based survey found that only 20 % of adults in this age group reported having had FOBT in the past year , and only 30 % had had a sigmoidoscopy in the past 5 years ( 4 ) . Data from clinical setting s reveal similarly low levels of performance . In the North Carolina Prescribe for Health study , a r and omized trial design ed to improve preventive care that involved nearly 60 community primary care practice s , chart audits conducted in 1994 found that only 32 % of adult patients older than 50 years of age had had FOBT within the past year and only 11 % had had  sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy within the past 3 years ( Pignone M , Harris R , Kinsinger L. Unpublished data ) . These low rates of colon cancer screening are multifactoral in origin . Many providers consider themselves too busy to address colon cancer screening or believe that patients are uninterested ( 5 ) . Patients , in contrast , are often not aware of the availability of colon cancer screening and often have not discussed screening with their physicians ( 6 ) . Efforts to increase performance of colon cancer screening have generally focused on providers , not patients ( 7 - 9 ) . Provider reminder systems have increased absolute completion rates of FOBT by about 14 % ( 10 ) . Few interventions have primarily targeted patients ( 11 - 14 ) . Vernon ( 15 ) review ed the efficacy of patient-directed interventions to increase the performance of colorectal cancer screening and found that several methods increased completion rates . Although physician-directed or office systemdirected interventions , such as audit and feedback or reminder systems , have been shown to be successful , many practice s may not use such systems or may not have included colorectal cancer in quality improvement initiatives . In addition , such systems only remind providers of the need to order testing and do not inform patients about the rationale for screening or how the screening tests are performed . We sought to examine whether a patient-oriented decision aid consisting of an educational video , patient-directed brochure , and chart marker could improve the ordering and performance of colon cancer screening . Methods Setting We conducted a r and omized , controlled trial in three community primary care practice s in two small to moderate-sized cities in central North Carolina from May to November 1998 . Two sites were primary care divisions of large multispecialty practice s , and the third was a three-physician satellite clinic . The study was approved by the institutional review board before initiation . Patients Participants were adults 50 to 75 years of age who were scheduled to be seen for a new or ongoing health problem by one of the participating providers from the three practice s. Eligibility Patients were excluded if they reported a personal or family history of colon cancer or if they had had home fecal occult blood testing ( FOBT ) in the past year or flexible sigmoidoscopy , colonoscopy , or barium enema in the past 5 years . Patients were also excluded if they were judged by the research assistant to be too ill to participate or if their appointments were only for laboratory blood work . Group Assignment Patients were contacted by telephone before their scheduled visits and asked to participate in a study of preventive care . Those who agreed to participate were asked to arrive 30 minutes before their scheduled appointments . The project 's research assistants obtained written informed consent to participate and assessed eligibility . Eligible patients were r and omly allocated by using a computerized r and om-number generator ( 16 ) . R and omization was performed central ly and was not balanced among centers . Assignments were placed in sealed , opaque , sequentially numbered envelopes and were distributed to the three sites . The research assistants opened the envelope for each participant only after eligibility was confirmed . Intervention Intervention group participants were asked to watch an 11-minute educational video on colon cancer and then choose one of three color-coded , patient-directed brochures to indicate their interest in screening . A matching laminated card was then attached to the patient 's chart . The content of the video was based on the results of a previous study ( 6 ) examining the effect of different types of information on patient interest in screening . The video used simple language and concepts and was tested in two focus groups of adults older than 50 years of age before it was used in this study . The video included information about susceptibility to colon cancer and availability of effective screening tests . It gave specific information about how home FOBT and flexible sigmoidoscopy are performed and explained the meaning of receiving a negative or positive test result . The video emphasized that screening had been shown to be effective and offered the patient a choice of FOBT , flexible sigmoidoscopy , or both . Finally , it presented brief vignettes featuring four patients who discussed their experiences with colon cancer screening . At the end of the video , the viewer was asked to choose the color-coded brochure that best reflected his or her current readiness to be screened for colon cancer . The video , available in an English- language version only , can be obtained through the Internet at www.med.unc.edu/medicine/edursrc/colon.htmor by contacting the authors . The color-coded brochures were based on Prochaska and colleagues ' stages-of-change model ( 17 ) . The green brochure signified current readiness to be screened , yellow indicated some interest in screening but a need for additional discussion or information , and red indicated no interest in screening at that time . The content of the brochures reinforced the main messages of the video in a stage-appropriate manner . Practice s were encouraged to add inserts with instructions specific to their testing procedures . A colored laminated card corresponding to the selected brochure was attached to each intervention group participant 's chart before he or she went on to see the care provider . The providers and office staff were not blinded to intervention status . Controls watched a video of similar length on car safety , seat belt use , and airbags and received a st and ard brochure on automobile safety . No cards were attached to their charts . Outcome Measures At baseline , before r and omization , a self-administered question naire was used to collect data on participants ' intent to ask their provider for colon cancer screening . Intent was measured by using a 4-point Likert scale ( 1=not at all likely , 4=very likely ) . After viewing a video , participants filled out a second question naire that again asked about intent to request screening . The research assistant recorded the participant 's choice of brochure at that time . The participants then saw their providers . Afterwards , participants completed a third question naire that asked whether a conversation about colon cancer screening had taken place during the visit and whether any colon cancer test was ordered . Questions about automobile safety were included in each of the three question naires . Three to 6 months after the clinic visit , a different research assistant who was blinded to participants ' intervention status examined participants ' clinic records in a st and ardized and vali date d manner to determine whether colon cancer screening tests were actually completed within 3 months of the index visit . Review ers recorded all colon cancer tests that were completed , not just the tests ordered at the index visit . Dual review s were conducted on a sample of the charts to ensure accuracy and reliability . The main outcome measures were differences in the proportions of patients in whom any colon cancer screening test ( home FOBT , flexible sigmoidoscopy , or both ) was ordered and completed . Office FOBT after rectal examination was recorded but was not counted as completed FOBT . Change in participants ' intent to ask their provider for a screening test at the index visit , measured by using a 4-point Likert scale , was a secondary outcome measure . Sample Size Calculation We sought to detect a minimum difference between groups of 20 % and estimated the proportion of participants in the control group who would have a screening test ordered to be 20 % to 30 % . For 80 % power and a two-sided value of 0.05 , 88 participants in each group were required . We therefore aim ed to enroll 100 participants in each group , with a minimum of 50 participants from each site . Statistical Analysis Data were analyzed by using Stata software , version 5.0 ( 16 ) . Categorical data , including the proportions of patients who completed screening tests , were compared by using chi-square tests and are reported as differences in proportions with 95 % CIs . Continuous data were compared by using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test . The main outcome of chart-verified screening test completion was measured on an intention-to-treat basis . The possibility of effect modification by practice or physician was examined by using stratified analyses and MantelHaenszel testing . Logistic regression was used to examine the effects of covariates on test ordering and completion . Analyses were adjusted for intraclass correlation due to clustering of the effect among physicians . Role of the Funding Sources Funding to develop and test the decision aid was provided by a grant from the National Cancer Institute . Fellowship support for Dr. Pignone was provided by the Robert Wood Johnson Clinical Scholars Program . The funding sources had no role in the collection , analysis , or interpretation of the data or in the decision to su bmi t the study for publication . Results Enrollment The process by which potential participants\", 'It is unclear how socioeconomic ( SES ) status influences the effectiveness of  shared decision making ( SDM ) tools .  The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of SES on the utility of  SDM tools  among patients with hip and knee osteoarthritis ( OA ) . We performed a secondary analysis of data from a r and omized controlled trial of 123 patients with hip or knee OA . Higher education and higher income were independently associated with higher knowledge survey scores .  Patients with private insurance were 2.7 times more likely than patients with Medicare to arrive at a decision after the initial office visit . Higher education was associated with lower odds of choosing surgery , even after adjusting for knowledge . Patient knowledge of their medical condition and treatment options varies with SES', 'PURPOSE The aim of this study was to match patient information requirements by determining whether giving patients a choice for additional preprocedural audiovisual information modifies the effectiveness of this information on anxiety , worry , knowledge , and patient satisfaction . METHODS Patients scheduled to undergo colonoscopy were approached one week before their procedure . All patients received an information leaflet during their st and ard preanesthetic clinic visit . Patients were r and omly assigned to a choice or no-choice condition . Patients in the choice condition were free to watch or not watch the video , people in the no-choice condition were further r and omized to watch or not watch the video . Measures of anxiety and worry were completed before watching the video .  Anxiety , worry , knowledge , and satisfaction were measured one week later just before the colonoscopy . RESULTS One hundred sixty-six patients completed the study . Of those patients r and omized to the choice condition , 69 percent wanted to watch the video . Those who chose not to watch the video were significantly more worried on the day of their procedure . Consistent with current evidence , watching the video was associated with improvements in short-term knowledge ( F ( 1,161 ) = 4.8 , P = 0.03 ) . There was , however , no significant effect of the choice or video conditions on anxiety or patient satisfaction . CONCLUSIONS There appears to be no additional benefits in terms of patient outcomes by allowing patients to choose whether they want additional audiovisual information . We suggest that all patients undergoing colonoscopy would benefit from watching such an educational video in the week before their procedure', 'This paper examines the proposition that there are considerable tensions between key strategies in health policy — namely , evidence -based approaches to population health improvement , reduction of health inequalities , and public and patient engagement — using ( 1 ) a critical analysis of the intersection of evidence -based public health , patient and public engagement , and health inequalities policies from a social constructionist perspective and ( 2 ) mathematical modelling of paternalistic and shared decision making in the management of hypertension in a r and om age and sex stratified community sample of residents of south east Northumberl and , UK . It is concluded that there may be unintended effects on population health of incongruities in major components of public health policy . Greater public and patient engagement may militate against the disease prevention goals of evidence -based policy , and may better engage sections of the population who already benefit from greater access and better health associated with social status and opportunity , serving to increase inequalities by further marginalising those already suffering from relative exclusion', \"Background . A major challenge in surgery is the integration of evidence -based medicine and patient autonomy . The authors present a r and omized trial study ing the effect of an individualized evidence -based brochure ( IB ) on patients ' autonomous behavior , patients ' ideals of autonomy , and quality of life . Method . Patients with an asymptomatic abdominal aneurysm and their surgeon were r and omized to receive a general brochure ( GB ) or an IB presenting survival information and a ranking of the treatment strategies . Before and after receiving the brochure , patients filled out question naires on their behavior during the consultation , ideals of patient autonomy , and quality of life . Surgeons answered a short checklist evaluating the consultation . Results . One hundred patients participated , 49 in the intervention , 51 in the control group . The IB group had a better underst and ing of important issues in the treatment decision , had prepared more questions , and was less satisfied with the duration of the consultation . Their impression that the surgeon perceived them more as a medical problem than a patient with a problem increased . They agreed less with the surgeon 's advice and lost some of their belief in ` ` the doctor knows best . ' ' Beforeh and , the IB group had a stronger preference for patient-based decisions , but afterward they displayed more surgeon-based decisions . No effects were seen on patients ' quality of life . Conclusions . Individualized evidence -based information stimulated patients ' active involvement but in the context of our study led to less patient-based decisions . Patient-made decisions and patient autonomy should , however , not be equated\", 'Background : Assessment and discussion of  individual risk for breast cancer within the primary care setting are crucial to discussion of risk reduction and timely referral . Methods : We conducted a r and omized controlled trial of a multiethnic , multilingual sample of women ages 40 to 74 years from two primary care practice s ( one academic , one safety net ) to test a breast cancer risk assessment and education intervention .  Patients were r and omly assigned to  control or intervention group . All patients completed a baseline  telephone survey and risk assessment  ( via telephone for controls , via tablet computer in clinic waiting room before visit for intervention ) . Intervention ( BreastCARE ) patients and their physicians received an individualized risk report to discuss during the visit . One-week follow-up telephone surveys with all patients assessed  patient – physician discussion of family cancer history , personal breast cancer risk , high-risk clinics , and genetic counseling/testing . Results : A total of 655 control and 580 intervention women completed the risk assessment and follow-up interview ; 25 % were high-risk by family history , Gail , or Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium risk models . BreastCARE increased discussion s of family cancer history [ OR , 1.54 ; 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) , 1.25–1.91 ] , personal breast cancer risk ( OR , 4.15 ; 95 % CI , 3.02–5.70 ) , high-risk clinics ( OR , 3.84 ; 95 % CI , 2.13–6.95 ) , and genetic counseling/testing ( OR , 2.22 ; 95 % CI , 1.34–3.68 ) . Among high-risk women , all intervention effects were stronger . Conclusions : An intervention combining an easy-to-use , quick risk assessment tool with patient-centered risk reports at the point of care can successfully promote discussion of breast cancer risk reduction between patients and primary care physicians , particularly for high-risk women . Impact : Next steps include scaling and dissemination of BreastCARE with integration into electronic medical record systems .

Motives for treatment did not differ significantly between the video image and st and ard CP groups . Two weeks after the case presentation , 60 % of the st and ard CP group and 74 % of the video image group ranked the anticipated change in facial appearance as an important factor in making a treatment decision . Seventy percent of the st and ard CP group and 83 % of the video image group agreed with the statement that surgery would be necessary to correct their problem . In the st and ard CP group , 47 % of the patients ranked dental casts as the most helpful physical record in making a treatment decision , and 46 % said the acetate profile tracing was the most helpful tool for underst and ing what to expect from treatment . In the video imaging group , 42 % of the patients said the  video imaging presentation  was the most helpful tool in making a treatment decision , and 39 % of the patients said it was the most helpful tool for underst and ing treatment expectations . The proportion of patients in the video image case presentation group with elevated self-image expectations following treatment was significantly higher ( P = .045 ) than in the st and ard case presentation group . The presentation of video images appears to be a valuable information source for conveying treatment options to patients , but caution may be needed to prevent elevated or possibly unrealistic treatment expectations', 'Background : Preventive guidelines on cardiovascular risk management recommend lifestyle changes . Support for lifestyle changes may be a useful task for practice nurses , but the effect of such interventions in primary prevention is not clear . We examined the effect of involving patients in nurse-led cardiovascular risk management on lifestyle adherence and cardiovascular risk . Methods : We performed a cluster r and omized controlled trial in 25 practice s that included 615 patients . The intervention consisted of nurse-led cardiovascular risk management , including risk assessment , risk communication , a decision aid and adapted motivational interviewing . The control group received a minimal nurse-led intervention . The self-reported outcome measures at one year were smoking , alcohol use , diet and physical activity . Nurses assessed 10-year cardiovascular mortality risk after one year . Results : There were no significant differences between the intervention groups . The effect of the intervention on the consumption of vegetables and physical activity was small , and some differences were only significant for subgroups . The effects of the intervention on the intake of fat , fruit and alcohol and smoking were not significant . We found no effect between the groups for cardiovascular 10-year risk . Interpretation : Nurse-led risk communication , use of a decision aid and adapted motivational interviewing did not lead to relevant differences between the groups in terms of lifestyle changes or cardiovascular risk , despite significant within-group differences', 'OBJECTIVE To examine the impact of providing fertility information on personal levels of fertility knowledge and intentions to delay childbearing . METHODS Participants ( n=69 young childless women ) were r and omly assigned to either an experimental ( fertility-related ) or control ( alcohol-related ) informational intervention group . Subsequent to the exposure to information , participants completed a question naire measuring fertility knowledge and intentions for reproduction . We predicted that the provision of fertility-related information would result in greater fertility knowledge and less intention to delay childbearing among young childless women . RESULTS The young women exposed to the brief fertility information intervention were significantly more likely to respond correctly to questions testing their fertility knowledge , and reported less intention to delay childbearing than the young women in the control group . CONCLUSION This study provided evidence that providing fertility-related information contributes to greater reproductive knowledge and may affect childbearing intentions . Future research is warranted to examine the influence of fertility information on reproductive decision-making within a theoretical framework in order to ensure that subsequent information interventions maximize their effectiveness', 'OBJECTIVE : To assess the impact of informed consent on elderly patients ’ colorectal cancer ( CRC ) screening preferences . DESIGN : R and omized , controlled trial . SETTING : Four general internal medicine practice s. PATIENTS : We studied 399 elderly patients visiting their primary care provider for routine office visits . INTERVENTIONS : Patients were r and omized to receive either a scripted control message briefly describing CRC screening methods or one of two informational interventions simulating an informed consent presentation about CRC screening . One intervention described CRC mortality risk reduction in relative terms ; the other , in absolute terms . MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS : The main outcome measure was intent to begin or continue fecal occult blood testing ( FOBT ) , flexible sigmoidoscopy , or both . There was no difference in screening interest between the control group and the two information groups ( p=.8 ) . The majority ( 63 % ) of patients intended to begin or continue CRC screening . Informed patients were able to gauge more accurately the positive predictive value of screening ( p=.0009 ) . Control patients rated the efficacy of screening higher than did patients receiving relative risk reduction information , who rated it higher than did patients receiving absolute risk reduction information ( p=.0002 ) . CONCLUSIONS : Elderly patients appeared to underst and CRC screening information and use it to gauge the efficacy of screening , but provision of information had no impact on their preferences for screening . In view of the large proportion who preferred not to be screened , we conclude that elderly patients should be involved in the screening decision . However , factors other than provision of information must determine their CRC screening preferences', 'Decision aids ( DAs ) are tools to support patients make informed health decisions with their practitioner . They aim to improve patient knowledge of options , incorporate patient preferences and values , and increase patient involvement in health decision making . Increasingly , the debate about DAs concerns how they should be implemented in practice , with the view that DAs are superior to usual clinical care in facilitating health decisions . The authors challenge this view and suggest that DA research has focused on measures of decision process , leaving the effects on the outcome of the decision relatively unknown . It is still unclear in which conditions DAs are better for patient health and well-being than clinician-led decisions . The authors present a new r and omized design to examine the effects of DA-supported patient choice on patient-centered outcomes to identify where DAs are best implemented in clinical practice . In this design , patients are r and omized to 1 of 4 arms : intervention A , intervention B , choice of either intervention supported by a clinician , or choice of either intervention supported by a decision aid .  Health and quality of life measured over the long term are presented as the primary outcomes . The authors propose that this design will allow the proper assessment of different modes of decision making', \"Objective : To evaluate the influence of physicians ' explanations on patients ' choices . Setting : A university-based Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center . Participants : 136 patients seen in a continuity-care general medicine clinic . Measurements and Results : Patients were r and omized to two groups [ Limited Explanation ( LE ) and Extensive Explanation ( EE ) ] and asked to choose between two alternative treatments ( differing in short-term vs long-term survival benefits ) for an unidentified medical condition , based on the information given in the explanations . LE consisted of a brief orientation to graphs summarizing the treatment results , while EE consisted of a detailed verbal description of the graphs . Significantly ( p < 0.001 ) more patients receiving EE changed their preferences across three pairs of five-year survival curves , compared with patients receiving LE . Of the patients receiving EE , 57 % reported either medium-term ( year 0-to-intercept or intercept-to-year 5 ) data or the average life expectancy for the five-year period contained in the curves ( ALE-5 ) as most influencing their decision making ; whereas 78 % of patients receiving LE reported only endpoint ( year 0 or year 5 ) data as most influencing their preferences . Conclusions : The patients ' treatment preferences for long-term vs short-term survival benefits were influenced by the amounts of verbal explanation provided to them about five-year survival graphs summarizing treatment results . The patients appeared to minimize the importance of medium-range data when those data were not specifically pointed out to them . Key words : cognitive biases ; framing effect ; informed consent ; medical decision making ; preferences ; five-year survival ; life expectancy .

We sought to determine if web-based decision aids increased knowledge of prostate cancer screening among African men . METHODS This postintervention , quasiexperimental research measured knowledge of prostate cancer screening among African-American men following receipt of 1 of 2  web-based decision aids : enhanced or usual care .  Men ages 40 - 65 were recruited at the annual convention of the Prince Hall Masons in the summer of 2007 , which was attended by 1170 masons . The primary outcome was knowledge of prostate cancer screening . RESULTS There were 87 participants in the sample with a mean age of 52 years ( st and ard deviation = 6.9 ) . Forty-six masons were r and omized to the enhanced decision aid , and 41 masons were r and omized to the usual care decision aid .  Knowledge scores were statistically significantly higher among the men receiving the enhanced decision aid compared to the usual care decision aid after simultaneously adjusting for age , educational level , marital status , family history , previous prostate specific antigen test and digital rectal exam ( p = 0.01 ) . CONCLUSION We found evidence that the enhanced web decision aid was significantly more effective than the usual care decision aid in promoting knowledge of the benefits , limitations and risks of prostate cancer screening . Web-based sites may be effective in facilitating discussion s about screening between patients and health care providers', 'Background Low back pain is a common and disabling condition leading to large health service and societal costs . Although there are several treatment options for back pain little is known about how to improve patient choice in treatment selection . The purpose of this study was to pilot a decision support package to help people choose between low back pain treatments . Methods This was a single-centred pilot cluster r and omised controlled trial conducted in a community physiotherapy service . We included adults with non-specific low back pain referred for physiotherapy . Intervention participants were sent an information booklet prior to their first consultation . Intervention physiotherapists were trained to enhance their skills in shared informed decision making . Those in the control arm received care as usual . The primary outcome was satisfaction with the treatment received at four months using a five-point Likert Scale dichotomised into “ satisfaction ” ( very satisfied or somewhat satisfied ) and “ non-satisfaction ” ( neither satisfied nor dissatisfied , somewhat dissatisfied or very dissatisfied ) . Results We recruited 148 participants . In the control arm 67 % of participants were satisfied with their treatment and in the intervention arm 53 % . The adjusted relative risk of being satisfied was 1.28 ( 95 % confidence interval 0.79 to 2.09 ) . For most secondary outcomes the trend was towards worse outcomes in the intervention group . For one measure ; the Rol and Morris Disability Question naire , this difference was clinical ly important ( 2.27 , 95 % confidence interval 0.08 to 4.47 ) . Mean healthcare costs were slightly lower ( £ 38 saving per patient ) within the intervention arm but health outcomes were also less favourable ( 0.02 fewer QALYs ) ; the estimated probability that the intervention would be cost-effective at an incremental threshold of £ 20,000 per QALY was 16 % . Conclusion We did not find that this decision support package improved satisfaction with treatment ; it may have had a substantial negative effect on clinical outcome , and is very unlikely to prove cost-effective . That a decision support package might have a clinical ly important detrimental effect is of concern . To our knowledge this has not been observed previously . Decision support packages should be formally tested for clinical and cost-effectiveness , and safety before implementation .

A second option , raloxifene , has recently been approved . The objective of the study was to determine women ’s interest in tamoxifen and raloxifene after reading a decision aid ( DA ) describing the risks and benefits of each medication . Women with 5-year risk of breast cancer ≥ 1.66 from two large health maintenance organizations were r and omized to receive a DA versus usual care . After reading an on-line DA that discussed the risks and benefits of tamoxifen and raloxifene , women completed measures of risk perception , decisional conflict , behavioral intentions , and actual behavior related to tamoxifen and raloxifene . 3 months following the intervention , 8.1 % of participants had looked for additional information about breast cancer prevention drugs , and 1.8 % had talked to their doctor about tamoxifen and /or raloxifene . The majority , 54.7 % , had decided to not take either drug , 0.5 % had started raloxifene , and none had started tamoxifen . Participants were not particularly worried about taking  tamoxifen  or raloxifene and did not perceive significant benefits from taking these drugs . Over 50 % did not perceive a change in their risk of getting breast cancer if they took tamoxifen or raloxifene . After reading a DA about tamoxifen and raloxifene , few women were interested in taking either breast cancer prevention drug', \"Introduction Women are largely unaware that mammography screening can cause overdetection of inconsequential disease , leading to overdiagnosis and overtreatment of breast cancer . Evidence is lacking about how information on overdetection affects women 's breast screening decisions and experiences . This study investigates the consequences of providing information about overdetection of breast cancer to women approaching the age of invitation to mammography screening . Methods and analysis This is a r and omised controlled trial with an embedded longitudinal qualitative sub study . Participants are a community sample of women aged 48–50 in New South Wales , Australia , recruited in 2014 . Women are r and omly allocated to either quantitative only follow-up ( n=904 ) or additional qualitative follow-up ( n=66 ) . Women in each stream are then r and omised to receive either the intervention ( evidence -based information booklet including overdetection , breast cancer mortality reduction and false positives ) or a control information booklet ( including mortality reduction and false positives only ) . The primary outcome is informed choice about breast screening ( adequate knowledge , and consistency between attitudes and intentions ) assessed via telephone interview at 2 weeks postintervention . Secondary outcomes measured at this time include decision process ( decisional conflict and confidence ) and psychosocial outcomes ( anticipated regret , anxiety , breast cancer worry and perceived risk ) . Women are further followed up at 6 months , 1 and 2 years to assess self-reported screening behaviour and long-term psychosocial outcomes ( decision regret , quality of life ) . Participants in the qualitative stream undergo additional in-depth interviews at each time point to explore the views and experiences of women who do and do not choose to have screening . Ethics and dissemination The study has ethical approval , and results will be published in peer- review ed journals . This research will help ensure that information about overdetection may be communicated clearly and effectively , using an evidence -based approach , to women considering breast cancer screening .

METHODS We conducted a r and omized controlled trial with 201 patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus ( 72 % African American or Latino ; 74 % with incomes of ≤$15,000 ) . Participants were r and omized to an intervention package consisting of a 24-minute video behavior support intervention with a workbook and 5 sessions of telephone coaching by a trained diabetes nurse or a 20-page brochure developed by the National Diabetes Education Program . Study measures were completed at baseline , 1 month , and 6 months . Participants ' review of the intervention material s was assessed at 1 month . The primary trial end point was hemoglobin A(1c ) value . Secondary end points included lipid levels , blood pressure , diabetes knowledge , and self-care behaviors . Data were analyzed with repeated measures analysis of variance . RESULTS Most participants in both groups ( 94 % ) review ed the intervention provided , and 73 % of participants assigned to the experimental group completed 5 sessions of telephone coaching . There was a significant overall reduction in mean ( SD ) hemoglobin A(1c ) value from baseline ( 9.6 % [ 2.0 % ] ) to 6 months ( 9.1 % [ 1.9 % ] ) ( P < .001 ) , but differences between groups were nonsignificant . Differences on other clinical measures ( lipid levels and blood pressure ) and measures of diabetes knowledge and self-care behaviors were also nonsignificant . CONCLUSIONS There was no significant effect of the experimental intervention compared with the control condition . The dose of intervention provided was less than in previously published studies .

We evaluated the effect of a videotape decision aid on promoting informed decision making about prostate cancer screening  among primary care patients . METHODS A group of 160 men , 45 to 70 years of age , with no history of prostate cancer , were r and omized to view or not to view a 20-minute educational videotape before a routine office visit at a university-based family medicine clinic . The subjects were contacted again 1 year after their visit to assess their receipt of prostate cancer screening ( digital rectal examination [ DRE ] or prostate-specific antigen [ PSA ] testing ) , their satisfaction with their screening decision , and knowledge retention since the baseline assessment . RESULTS Follow-up assessment s were completed for 87.5 % of the intervention subjects and 83.8 % of the control subjects . The rate of DRE did not differ between the 2 groups . Prostate-specific antigen testing was reported by 24 of 70 ( 34.3 % ) intervention subjects and 37 of 67 ( 55.2 % ) control subjects ( P = .01 ) . African American men were more likely to have had PSA testing ( 9 of 16 , 56.3 % ) than were white men ( 13 of 46 , 28.3 % ) ( P = .044 ) . Satisfaction with the screening decision did not differ between the study groups . Intervention subjects were more knowledgeable of prostate cancer screening than were control subjects , although these differences declined within 1 year ( P < .001 ) .

Interventions Brochure with evidence based risk information on colorectal cancer screening and two optional interactive internet modules on risk and diagnostic tests ; official information leaflet of the German colorectal cancer screening programme ( control ) . Main outcome measure The primary end point was “ informed choice , ” comprising “ knowledge , ” “ attitude , ” and “ combination of actual and planned uptake . ” Secondary outcomes were “ knowledge ” and “ combination of actual and planned uptake . ” Knowledge and attitude were assessed after 6 weeks and combination of actual and planned uptake of screening after 6 months . Results The response rate for return of both question naires was 92.4 % ( n=1457 ) . 345/785 ( 44.0 % ) participants in the intervention group made an informed choice , compared with 101/792 ( 12.8 % ) in the control group ( difference 31.2 % , 99 % confidence interval 25.7 % to 36.7 % ; P<0.001 ) . More intervention group participants had “ good knowledge ” ( 59.6 % ( n=468 ) v 16.2 % ( 128 ) ; difference 43.5 % , 37.8 % to 49.1 % ; P<0.001 ) . A “ positive attitude ” towards colorectal screening prevailed in both groups but was significantly lower in the intervention group ( 93.4 % ( 733 ) v 96.5 % ( 764 ) ; difference −3.1 % , −5.9 % to −0.3 % ; P<0.01 ) . The intervention had no effect on the combination of actual and planned uptake ( 72.4 % ( 568 ) v 72.9 % ( 577 ) ; P=0.87 ) .

Low health literacy may contribute to this underutilization by interfering with patients ' ability to underst and and receive preventive health services . PURPOSE To determine if a web-based multimedia CRC screening patient decision aid , developed for a mixed-literacy audience , could increase CRC screening . DESIGN RCT . Patients aged 50 - 74 years and overdue for CRC screening were r and omized to the web-based decision aid or a control program seen immediately before a scheduled primary care appointment . SETTING / PARTICIPANTS A large community-based , university-affiliated internal medicine practice serving a socioeconomically disadvantaged population . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Patients completed surveys to determine their ability to state a screening test preference and their readiness to receive screening . Charts were abstract ed by masked observers to determine if screening tests were ordered and completed . RESULTS Between November 2007 and September 2008 , a total of 264 patients enrolled in the study . Data collection was completed in 2009 , and data analysis was completed in 2010 . A majority of participants ( mean age=57.8 years ) were female ( 67 % ) , African-American ( 74 % ) , had annual household incomes of < $ 20,000 ( 76 % ) , and had limited health literacy ( 56 % ) . When compared to control participants , more decision-aid participants had a CRC screening preference ( 84 % vs 55 % , p<0.0001 ) and an increase in readiness to receive screening ( 52 % vs 20 % , p=0.0001 ) . More decision-aid participants had CRC screening tests ordered ( 30 % vs 21 % ) and completed ( 19 % vs 14 % ) , but no statistically significant differences were seen ( AOR=1.6 , 95 % CI=0.97 , 2.8 , and AOR=1.7 , 95 % CI=0.88 , 3.2 , respectively ) . Similar results were found across literacy levels . CONCLUSIONS The web-based decision aid increased patients '  ability to form a test preference and their intent to receive screening , regardless of literacy level . Further study should examine ways the decision aid can be combined with additional system changes to increase CRC screening\", 'BACKGROUND We conducted a r and omized controlled trial to evaluate the effects of patient decision support Web sites on decision quality for men considering prostate cancer screening . METHODS Men older than 50 years ( N = 611 ) were r and omly assigned to 1 of 4 Internet conditions : traditional didactic decision aid providing information about prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) screening options and outcomes ; chronic disease trajectory model for prostate cancer followed by a time-trade-off exercise ; both the didactic decision aid and the chronic disease trajectory model ; or links to public prostate cancer-specific Web sites from credible sources ( control condition ) . Participants completed question naires at baseline and after their physical examination . Primary outcome measures were PSA test choice , prostate cancer treatment preferences , knowledge and concern about prostate cancer , and decisional conflict . RESULTS Participants assigned to view public Web sites were less likely to review information ( 116 participants [ 76.8 % ] review ed ) than those assigned to experimental groups ( 399 [ 86.7 % ] review ed ; P = .004 ) . Greater reductions in PSA screening from pretest to posttest were observed among participants assigned to the traditional decision aid ( -9.1 % ) or chronic disease trajectory model ( -8.7 % ) , compared with participants assigned to the combination ( -5.3 % ) or control ( -3.3 % ) groups ( P = .047 ) . Preferences for watchful waiting increased significantly in all 4 groups ( baseline , 219 [ 35.8 % ] ; follow-up , 303 [ 66.2 % ] ; P < .001 ) . Knowledge scores were lowest for those assigned to public Web sites ( mean [ SD ] score , 7.49 [ 0.19 ] of questions correct ) and highest for the traditional decision aid ( 8.65 [ 0.18 ] of questions correct ; P = .005 ) .

METHODS Separate patient and clinician web-tools comprised of over 500 , 10-s video clips demonstrating  patient-centered skills in various ways . Four clinician members of the American Academy of Family Physicians National Research Network participated by enrolling 194 patients into a r and omized patient trial and 29 physicians into a non-r and omized clinician trial of respective interventions . All participants completed baseline and follow-up self-report measures of visit communication and satisfaction . RESULTS Intervention patients reported using more skills than controls in five of six skill areas , including identification of problems/concerns , information exchange , treatment adherence , shared decision-making and interpersonal rapport ( all p<.05 ) ; post intervention , physicians reported using more skills in the same 5 areas ( all p<.01 ) . Intervention group patients reported higher levels of satisfaction than controls in five of six domains ( all p<.05 ) .

The study goal was to develop and test a decision aid for use by clinicians in discussion options for changing smoking behavior before and after elective surgery . Methods : In formative work , a decision aid was design ed to facilitate patient – clinician discussion regarding three options : continue smoking , attempt a period of temporary abstinence , and attempt to quit smoking for good . A r and omized , two-group pilot study was then conducted in smokers evaluated in preparation for elective surgery in a preoperative clinic to test the hypothesis that the decision aid would improve measures of decisional quality compared with usual care . Results : The final decision aid consisted of three laminated cards . The front of each card included a colorful graphic describing each choice ; the reverse including two to three pros and cons for each decision , a simple graphic illustrating the effects of smoking on the body , and a motivational phrase . In the r and omized trial of 130 patients , the decision aid significantly ( P < 0.05 ) improved measures of decisional quality and patient involvement in decision making ( Cohen ’s d effect sizes of 0.76 and 1.20 for the Decisional Conflict Scale and Observing PatienT involvement In decisiON-making scale , respectively ) . However , the decision aid did not affect any aspect of perioperative smoking behavior , including the distribution of or adherence to choices . Conclusions : Although the use of a decision aid to facilitate clinician – patient discussion s regarding tobacco use around the time of surgery substantially improved measures of decisional quality , it alone did not change perioperative tobacco use behavior', 'OBJECTIVE To assess the effectiveness of an audio-guided component : an audio-guided decision aid vs. a st and -alone booklet decision aid .

DESIGN R and omized controlled trial . SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS Two obstetric hospitals in Sydney , Australia . A total of 395 pregnant women having their first baby and approximately > or = 36 weeks of gestation , planning a vaginal birth of a single infant and with self-assessed English sufficiency to read and listen to English-presented material . INTERVENTION A decision aid for labour and childbirth analgesia that was presented in two ways : an audio-guided decision aid compared with a booklet only style decision aid . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Decisional conflict , knowledge and anxiety . RESULTS Although both groups improved their knowledge scores and decreased their decisional conflict there were no significant differences between groups : mean knowledge score - audio-guided group , 65.9 vs. booklet group , 64.3 ; mean difference , 1.7 ; 95 % CI ( -7.5 , 4.2 ) ; mean decisional conflict score - audio-guided group , 23.6 vs. booklet group , 24.3 ; mean difference , 0.7 ; 95 % CI ( -1.4 , 2.9 ) . Acceptability and compliance were high . DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS This evaluation highlights the lack of additional benefit in using audio-guided formats for presenting health information to consumers who are from a general English-speaking population . These results considered together with the increase in costs and work involved in producing audio components suggests that written and pictorial methods may be sufficient for decision aids aim ed at a general audience', 'OBJECTIVE The aim of this study is to evaluate a method , \" Counseling in Dialogue \" ( CD ) , developed to increase the quality of counseling in youth mental health . Decisional conflict was used as indicator of the quality of counseling and shared decision-making . METHODS 94 children aged 2 - 12 years were r and omized into a CD group and a care as usual ( CU ) group . In a before- and -after design decisional conflict was measured using the  decisional conflict scale ( DCS ) for parents ( N=133 ) and the  Provider Decision Process Assessment Instrument  for therapists ( PDPAI , N=20 ) . 81 children had follow-up data . RESULTS Compared with parents of the CU group , parents of the CD group reported significantly less decisional conflict after counseling ( difference mothers : -0.38 ( 95%CI -0.56 ; -0.19 ) , p<.001 ; fathers : -0.22 ( 95%CI -0.44 ; -0.01 ) , p=.045 ) . 98 % of the mothers and 96 % of the fathers in the CD group accepted the recommended treatment , compared to 71 % ( fathers ) and 77 % ( mothers ) in the CU group , p<0.05 . Decisional conflict of the therapists was low in both groups after counseling ( difference : -0.03 ( 95%CI -0.19 ; 0.14 ) , p=.741 ) . CONCLUSION The counseling procedure significantly lowered decisional conflict of the parents and promoted the acceptance of the recommended treatment', 'Objective Previous studies have not assessed whether evidence -based information about the outcomes of colorectal cancer screening increases informed choice among people from a range of socioeconomic background s nor have they assessed whether this can be administered away from a health-care provider . Methods R and omized controlled trial in six primary care locations . Three hundred and fourteen people aged 50–74 years received a self-administered decision aid ( DA ) booklet about outcomes of biennial faecal occult blood testing ( FOBT ) screening or government consumer guidelines ( G ) . Results Significantly more DA recipients ( 20.9 % ) were ‘ informed ’ compared with G recipients ( 5.8 % ) ( P = 0.0001 , OR 4.32 ; 95 % CI 2.49 to 7.52 ) ; the DA did not affect values clarity ( 61.9 % clear after DA versus 59.1 % after G ) nor screening decisions overall ( 87.3 % would screen after DA versus 90.5 % after G ) . Test uptake at one month was uniformly low ( 5.2 % DA versus 6.6 % G ) ; mostly due to being ‘ too busy ’ . DA recipients were more likely to make decisions ‘ integrating ’ knowledge with values ( 10.4 % DA versus 1.5 % G ) . Decisions not to screen were equally uncommon in both groups but more likely to be uninformed in G ( P = 0.03 ) . More DA recipients from all education levels were ‘ informed ’ ( P = 0.02 ) , particularly in lower education ( 50.0 % DA versus 17.8 % G ) and university-educated groups ( 79.4 % DA versus 32.1 % G ) . Conclusion Detailed absolute risk and benefit information about FOBT screening can be effectively used at home by people to increase informed choice . The DA was effective in people with lower education levels .

RESULTS Anxiety levels were significantly reduced in both groups , but the difference between the effectiveness of the two interventions was not significant ( P = .77 ) . Percentages of women whose general knowledge increased and of women with realistic expectations were significantly higher in the experimental group ( P < .003 and P < .0001 , respectively ) . Congruence between personal values and decisions about HRT  increased significantly more in the experimental group ( P < or = .003 ) . CONCLUSION The six-step approach to decision making was more helpful than the SOGC 's information document in increasing subjects ' knowledge of the risks and benefits of HRT , in creating more realistic expectations of HRT , and in increasing the congruence between subjects ' personal values and their decisions on HRT\", \"Decision aids ( DAs ) are increasingly being developed to help patients make shared health care decisions with their practitioners . There are no formal comparisons of the efficacy of different delivery methods . Interactive computerized delivery methods have the advantage of allowing patients control over flow of information and to receive feedback on their comprehension . The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of an interactive computerized DA for women considering long-term hormone replacement therapy , to that of a vali date d audio-booklet version of the same intervention . Fifty-one peri-menopausal women were r and omized to use either the computerized or the st and ard audio-booklet version of the DA . The computerized version presented identical information with the addition of feedback modules to reinforce the participant 's underst and ing . The patients were interviewed with a pre- and post-intervention question naire . The computerized DA  improved realistic expectations by 52.7 % over baseline versus 27.6 % with the audio-booklet ( P=0.015 ) . Knowledge ( Kn ) scores improved by 17.5 and 8.4 % for the computer and st and ard DA groups , respectively ( P=0.019 ) . The results of this study have implication s for future DA design , and other areas where patient Kn and underst and ing are important , such as in the setting of informed consent\", \"OBJECTIVE To assess the feasibility and outcome of measuring the  theory of planned behaviour ( TPB )  in patients receiving routine counselling versus counselling with a decision aid ( DA ) during primary care consultation on cardiovascular risk prevention . METHODS A DA was developed , based on models of shared decision-making ( SDM ) and the TPB . We evaluated the impact of the intervention in a r and omized controlled trial . Main outcomes were previously reported . To assess the intermediate social cognitive processes and our theoretical framework , we evaluated the impact of the intervention on a TPB scale . RESULTS The  TPB scale showed satisfactory measurement properties . Factor analysis ( main component analysis , confirmatory model ) could mostly replicate the assumptions of the model . 44 % of variance of the behavioural intention to adhere to the decision after counselling was explained in linear regression models . Of the TPB components , only attitude towards the decision and moral norm were significantly more positive in the intervention . No difference was found with regard to intention to adhere to the decision . High risk result ed in higher values of the TPB components in both groups . CONCLUSION Most DAs are developed and tested without explicitly referring to a theoretical model of psychosocial processes . The TPB may serve as a useful theoretical framework . PRACTICE IMPLICATION S Trials on DAs demonstrate positive effects on psychological outcomes of patients without leading to better objective health results . Our study might contribute to an explanation : DAs might not cause stronger adherence to decisions even though one 's attitude towards the decision becomes more positive\", \"OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effect of a decision aid ( DA ) on women 's knowledge of the benefits and harms of screening and on their ability to make an informed decision . METHODS An online r and omized controlled trial among 321 women aged 38 - 45 years was conducted . Participants were r and omized to either immediate or delayed access to the online DA which ( i ) explained the benefits and harms , ( ii ) included a values clarification exercise and a worksheet to support decision making . The primary outcome , knowledge of benefits and harms of screening , and secondary outcomes , informed choice ( composite of knowledge , values and intention ) , anxiety and acceptability of the DA were measured using online question naires . RESULTS Women in the intervention group were more knowledgeable ( mean score out of 10 , 7.35 vs 6.27 , p<0.001 ) and were more likely to have made a decision ( 82 % vs 61 % p<0.001 ) . Of those who made a decision , women in the intervention group were less likely to start screening now ( 52 % vs 65 % p=0.05 ) . There was no significant difference in the proportion of women who made an informed choice ( 71 % intervention group vs 64 % control group , p=0.24 ) . The DA was helpful , balanced and clear , and did not make women anxious . CONCLUSIONS The DA increased knowledge and reduced indecision , without increasing feelings of anxiety . PRACTICE IMPLICATION S This decision aid is easy to access online and could be an inexpensive way of supporting women aged 40 who are considering whether to start screening now , or wait until they are 50 . The results of this study demonstrate the potential of DAs to help inform women about both the benefits and risks of screening at this age and to support women and clinicians in this decision making process\", 'Background .Back surgery rates are rapidly rising in the United States . This surgery is usually elective , so patient preferences are important in the treatment decision . Objectives .The objective of this study was to determine the impact on outcomes and surgical choices of an interactive , diagnosis-specific videodisk program for informing patients about treatment choices . Research Design .This was a r and omized , controlled trial at 2 sites comparing the interactive video plus a booklet with the booklet alone . Subjects . Elective surgery c and i date s ( n = 393 ) included 171 patients with herniated disks , 110 with spinal stenosis , and 112 with other diagnoses . Measures .Mailed question naires were used to assess outcomes and satisfaction ; surgery rates were determined by question naires and automated records . Results .Symptom and functional outcomes at 3 months and 1 year were similar between study groups . The overall surgery rate was 22 % lower in the videodisk group ( 26 % versus 33 % , P = 0.08 ) . Among patients with herniated disks , those in the video group underwent significantly less surgery ( 32 % versus 47 % , P = 0.05 by Kaplan-Meier test ) . Among patients with spinal stenosis , surgery rates in the video group were higher ( 39 % for the video group , 29 % for the booklet group;P = 0.4 ) . There was little effect on patient satisfaction , but patients in the video group felt better informed . Conclusions .The program appears to facilitate decision making and may help to ensure informed consent . For patients with herniated disks , it reduced the surgery rate without diminishing patient outcomes . Its impact on costs of care depends on the proportion of patients with various diagnoses and on local surgery rates', 'INTRODUCTION Health communication interventions have been modestly effective for increasing informed decision making for prostate cancer screening among African-American men ; however , knowledge and informed decision making is still question able even with screening . Church-based programs may be more effective if they are spiritually based in nature . OBJECTIVE The aims of the present study were to implement and provide an initial evaluation of a spiritually based prostate cancer screening informed decision making intervention for African-American men who attend church , and determine its efficacy for increasing informed decision making . DESIGN AND METHOD Churches were r and omized to receive either the spiritually based or the non-spiritual intervention . Trained community health advisors , who were African-American male church members , led an educational session and distributed educational print material s. Participants completed baseline and immediate follow-up surveys to assess the intervention impact on study outcomes . RESULTS The spiritually based intervention appeared to be more effective in areas such as knowledge , and men read more of their material s in the spiritually based group than in the non-spiritual group . CONCLUSIONS Further examination of the efficacy of the spiritually based approach to health communication is warranted', \"OBJECTIVE To assess the impact of Guide to Decide ( GtD ) , a web-based , personally-tailored decision aid design ed to inform women 's decisions about prophylactic tamoxifen and raloxifene use . METHODS Postmenopausal women , age 46 - 74 , with BCRAT 5-year risk ≥ 1.66 % and no prior history of breast cancer were r and omized to one of three study arms : intervention ( n=690 ) , Time 1 control ( n=160 ) , or 3-month control ( n=162 ) . Intervention participants viewed GtD prior to completing a post-test and 3 month follow-up assessment . Controls did not . We assessed the impact of  GtD on women 's decisional conflict levels and treatment decision behavior at post-test and at 3 months , respectively . RESULTS Intervention participants had significantly lower decisional conflict levels at post-test ( p<0.001 ) and significantly higher odds of making a decision about whether or not to take prophylactic tamoxifen or raloxifene at 3-month follow-up ( p<0.001 ) compared to control participants . CONCLUSION GtD  lowered decisional conflict and helped women at high risk of breast cancer decide whether to take prophylactic tamoxifen or raloxifene to reduce their cancer risk . PRACTICE IMPLICATION S Web-based , tailored decision aids should be used more routinely to facilitate informed medical decisions , reduce patients ' decisional conflict , and empower patients to choose the treatment strategy that best reflects their own values\", 'PURPOSE Women with BRCA1/2 mutations are faced with complex decisions about breast and ovarian cancer risk management . This study was conducted to determine the effect of a tailored decision support system ( DSS ) that provides individualized survival and cancer incidence curves specific to expected outcomes of alternative management strategies . PATIENTS AND METHODS This was a double-blind , r and omized controlled trial of 32 women with BRCA1/2 mutations . Primary outcome measures were decision satisfaction , cancer anxiety , perceptions of cancer risk given alternative management strategies , and management decisions . RESULTS Twenty-seven women completed a 6-week follow-up . Women in the intervention arm ( n = 13 ) reported significantly higher decision satisfaction at follow-up than women in the control arm ( n = 14 ; adjusted mean difference , 9.7 ; P < .0005 ) . The effect of the DSS was greater among women with low cancer anxiety at baseline than women with high cancer anxiety at baseline ( P = .01 for interaction ) . However , the DSS did not significantly alter cancer anxiety at follow-up , perceptions of cancer risk given alternative management strategies , or management decisions . CONCLUSION The presentation of individualized survival and incidence curves for alternative management options improves satisfaction about cancer risk management decisions among women with BRCA1/2 mutations without increasing anxiety or changing management decisions . The benefit of the DSS is greatest among women with relatively low cancer-related anxiety at baseline', 'Aim : As survival rates for aggressive and conservative breast and lymph node surgery are similar , surgical treatment decisions for patients with early‐stage breast cancer should take patient preference into account . Decision aids have been demonstrated to increase patient knowledge and satisfaction with decision making , while decreasing decisional conflict . Hundreds of decision aids exist ; however , few address lymph node surgery in any detail , and none acknowledge that there is a choice comparable to that between mastectomy and breast‐conserving therapy', 'Abstract OBJECTIVE : Routine screening for prostate cancer is controversial because of frequent false-positive results , the potential for slow , non-life-threatening growth of untreated cancer , the uncertainty regarding whether treatment can extend life , and the potential for treatment complications . This study examines how information about prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) testing and the uncertain benefits of treating prostate cancer affects patients ’ desire for PSA testing . DESIGN : An educational videotape design ed to inform men about the uncertainty surrounding PSA screening and the treatment of early-stage prostate cancer was presented to two groups of male patients 50 years of age or older . SETTING : Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center . PATIENTS / PARTICIPANTS : For study 1 , men seeking a free prostate cancer screening were preassigned to view the educational videotape ( N=184 ) or another videotape ( N=188 ) . For study 2 , men scheduled to visit a general internal medicine clinic viewed either the educational videotape ( N=103 ) or no videotape ( N=93 ) . MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS : The men ’s information and preferences about prostate cancer screening and treatment and actual choice of PSA test at the next test opportunity were measured . Men who viewed the educational videotape were : better informed about PSA tests , prostate cancer , and its treatment ; preferred no active treatment if cancer were found ; and preferred not to be screened ( all significant atp≤.002 in both studies ) . Men viewing the educational video were less likely to have a PSA test ( p=.041 , study 2 ) . This tendency was not significant at the free-PSA clinic ( p=.079 ) . CONCLUSIONS : Preference regarding cancer screening and treatment is greatly affected by information about medical uncertainties . Because informed patient choices vary , PSA screening decisions should incorporate individual preferences', \"PURPOSE This study tested the efficacy of an intervention on end-of-life decision making for patients with advanced cancer . PATIENTS AND METHODS One hundred twenty patients with metastatic cancer who were no longer being treated with curative intent ( and 87 caregivers ) were r and omly assigned to the intervention ( n = 55 ) or treatment as usual ( n = 65 ) . Primary outcome measures were the proportion of patients with do-not-resuscitate ( DNR ) orders , timing of DNR orders , and place of death . Secondary outcome measures were completed at study enrollment , 3 weeks later , and 3 months later , including patients ' knowledge , mood , and caregiver burden . RESULTS High , but equivalent , rates of DNR orders were observed in both groups . In per- protocol analyses , DNR orders were placed earlier for patients who received the intervention ( median , 27 v 12.5 days ; 95 % CI , 1.1 to 5.9 ; P = .03 ) and they were more likely to avoid a hospital death ( 19 % v 50 % ( 95 % CI , 11 % to 50 % ; P = .004 ) . Differences between the groups over time were evident for estimates of cardiopulmonary rehabilitation ( CPR ) success rates ( P = .01 ) but not knowledge of CPR ( P = .2 ) . There was no evidence that the intervention result ed in more anxious or depressive symptoms . Caregivers experienced less burden in terms of disruption to schedule if the patient received the intervention ( P = .05 ) . CONCLUSION An intervention , consisting of an informational pamphlet and discussion , was associated with earlier placement of DNR orders relative to death and less likelihood of death in hospital . There was no negative impact of the intervention on secondary outcomes , although the sample may have been too small to detect differences\", \"BACKGROUND Use of the prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) as a screening test remains highly controversial , particularly in older men . This study was undertaken to assess the impact of information on the preferences of older men for such screening . METHODS The elderly cohort ( age > or = 65 years ) of a larger r and omized trial was studied to determine the effect of a 3-minute scripted informational intervention on primary care patients ' interest in PSA screening and on potential predictors of screening interest . RESULTS Informed patients were significantly less interested in screening than were uninformed patients ( p = .006 ) . Informed patients considered  PSA screening  to be significantly less efficacious than did uninformed patients ( p = .004 ) , but among both uninformed and informed patients , perceived efficacy correlated with interest in screening ( multivariate OR 2.3 , 95 % CI 1.5 - 3.8 for uninformed patients ; OR 2.2 , 95 % CI 1.3 - 3.9 for informed patients ) . Perceived seriousness of prostate cancer predicted interest in screening among uninformed patients ( OR 1.8 , 95 % CI 1.3 - 2.6 ) , but not among informed patients . Informed patients who were married were less interested in screening than those who were single , divorced , or widowed ( OR 0.3 , 95 % CI .08 - 0.9 ) . Marital status did not predict screening interest among uninformed patients . CONCLUSIONS Involving elderly patients in the decision whether to screen with the PSA by providing them with information leads to a significant reduction in interest in such screening . Factors that appear to influence the screening preferences of informed elderly patients include perceived efficacy of screening and marital status , whereas uninformed patients are more likely to weigh the perceived seriousness of prostate cancer in their screening decision\", 'To determine whether different approaches in the choice of treatment affect the treatment chosen by the patient for prostate cancer', 'PURPOSE Decision making in advanced cancer is increasingly complex . We developed a decision aid ( DA ) for patients with advanced colorectal cancer who are considering first-line chemotherapy and review ing treatment options , prognostic information , and toxicities . We examined its impact on patient underst and ing , treatment decisions , decisional conflict , decision making , consultation satisfaction , anxiety , and quality of life by using a r and omized trial design . PATIENTS AND METHODS In all , 207 patients with colorectal cancer who were considering first-line chemotherapy for metastatic disease were r and omly assigned to receive a st and ard medical oncology consultation or a consultation in which the DA ( take-home booklet with audio recording , review ed by an oncologist ) was used . Participants completed question naires postconsultation , postdecision , and 1 month later . RESULTS In this study , 100 patients were r and omly assigned to the  control  arm , and 107 received the DA .  Median age of the sample was 62 years , 58 % were male , 89 % had a performance status of 0 or 1 , and 36 % had received prior adjuvant chemotherapy . Patients receiving the DA demonstrated a greater increase in underst and ing of prognosis , options , and benefits , with higher overall underst and ing ( P < .001 ) . Decisional conflict , treatment decisions , and achievement of involvement preferences were similar between the groups . Anxiety was similar across groups and decreased over time . Most patients were confident in a decision during the first consultation ; 74 % chose chemotherapy , 7 % supportive care alone , and 10 % observation . CONCLUSION This r and omized trial of a decision aid in advanced cancer showed that its use in advanced colorectal cancer improved patient underst and ing of prognosis , treatment options , risks , and benefits without increasing anxiety . DAs can improve informed consent and can be tested through r and omized trials even in the advanced cancer setting', \"BACKGROUND Associations between optimal use of a tailored decision-aid and levels of accuracy of perceived breast cancer risk , confidence in decision-making , and satisfaction with decisions about HRT were evaluated in a r and omized intervention trial with a community sample of women aged 45 - 54 . METHODS Data are from 289 women r and omized to receive a computer-tailored three-step decision-aid .  RESULTS Forty-seven percent of participants reported optimal use of the intervention material s. African American women and those with low confidence in decision-making were less likely to use the intervention optimally than white women and those with higher confidence ( P<0.05 ) . Optimal use of the decision-aid was associated with increased accuracy of perceived risk and confidence to make a decision . DISCUSSION When used optimally , self-directed decision-aids can improve women 's  ability to make decisions about HRT . Additional refinement of these aids is needed . For some subgroups of women , adjuncts such as telephone counseling also might be considered\", 'Background : Adolescent survivors of childhood cancer engage in risky behaviors . Objective : This study tested a decision aid for cancer-surviving adolescents aim ed at difficult decisions related to engaging in substance use behaviors . Methods : This r and omized controlled trial recruited 243 teen survivors at 3 cancer centers . The cognitive-behavioral skills program focused on decision making and substance use within the context of past treatment . Effects at 6 and 12 months were examined for decision making , risk motivation , and substance use behaviors using linear regression models . Results : The majority of the teen cancer survivors ( 90 % ) rated the program as positive . There was an intermediate effect at 6 months for change in risk motivation for low riskers , but this effect was not sustained at 12 months . For quality decision making , there was no significant effect between treatment groups for either time point . Conclusions : The overall program effects were modest . Once teen survivors are in the program and learn what quality decision making is , their written reports indicated adjustment in their perception of their decision-making ability ; thus , a more diagnostic baseline decision-making measure and a more intensive intervention are needed in the last 6 months . With 2 of 3 teen participants dealing with cognitive difficulties , the data suggest that this type of intervention will continue to be challenging , especially when 90 % of their household members and 56 % of their close friends model substance use . Implication s for Practice : This effectiveness trial using late-effects clinics provides recommendations for further program development for medically at-risk adolescents , particularly ones with cognitive difficulties', 'No abstract available .', 'The purpose of this study was to describe and compare  patient preferences for a  genetic counselor  or an interactive computer program for various components of genetic education and counseling for breast cancer susceptibility . As part of a r and omized intervention study on genetics education and counseling for breast cancer risk , 29 women at moderate risk were educated by both a genetic counselor and an interactive computer program . After both educational interventions , participants completed Likert-style and open-ended question naires about what they liked most and least about each intervention , and whether they preferred the counselor or computer for a variety of tasks . Participants were largely satisfied with both the computer program and the genetic counselor . A majority preferred the genetic counselor for addressing their concerns , discussing options and alternatives , being sensitive to emotional concerns , helping to make a decision , being a good listener , assuring underst and ing , helping to make a good choice , helping to underst and genes and breast cancer , telling them what they needed to know , being respectful , setting a relaxed tone , and putting them at ease . However , a majority of the women either preferred the computer program or were neutral about allowing patients to learn at their own pace , helping to avoid embarrassment , making good use of time , explaining genes and breast cancer , and treating the patient as an adult . Qualitative analysis of open-ended questions affirmed that patients valued the personal interactions with the counselors , and liked having their specific questions answered . They liked that the computer was self-paced , informative and private , and could be used without causing embarrassment . We concluded that a computer literate , mostly white group of women at moderate risk for inherited susceptibility to breast cancer preferred interacting with a genetic counselor for personal , individualized components of the genetic counseling process , but accepted or preferred a computer program for being self-paced , private , and informative . By incorporating such a computer program into the genetic education process , it is possible that genetic counselors would be able to spend more time performing the personal , individualized components of genetic counseling', \"OBJECTIVE Does decision navigation ( DN ) increase prostate cancer patients '  confidence and certainty in treatment decisions , while reducing regret associated with the decisions made ? METHODS Two hundred eighty-nine newly diagnosed prostate cancer patients were eligible . 123 consented and were r and omised to usual care  ( n = 60 ) or navigation ( n = 63 ) . The intervention involved a ' navigator ' guiding the patient in creating a personal question list for a consultation and providing a CD and typed summary of the consultation to patients , the general practitioner and physician . The primary outcome was decisional self efficacy . Secondary outcomes included decisional conflict ( DCS ) and decisional regret ( RS ) . Measures of mood ( Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale ) and adjustment ( Mental Adjustment to Cancer Scale ) were included to detect potential adverse effects of the intervention . RESULTS ANOVA showed a main effect for the group ( F = 7.161 , df 1 , p = 0.009 ) . Post hoc comparisons showed significantly higher decisional self efficacy in the navigated patients post-consultation and 6 months later . Decisional conflict was lower for navigated patients initially ( t = 2.005 , df = 105 , p = 0.047 ) , not at follow-up ( t = 1.969 , df = 109 , p = 0.052 ) . Regret scores were significantly lower in the navigation group compared to the controls 6 months later ( t = -2.130 , df = 100 , p = 0.036 ) . There was no impact of the intervention on mood or adjustment . CONCLUSION Compared to control patients , navigated patients were more confident in making decisions about cancer treatment , were more certain they had made the right decision after the consultation and had less regret about their decision 6 months later . Decision navigation was feasible , acceptable and effective for newly diagnosed prostate cancer patients in Scotl and\", 'BACKGROUND Many women who have participated in mammography screening are now approaching 70 years of age . These women are advised to consider both the benefits and harms of continuing to be screened . Doing so may be difficult for individual women , and there are no evaluated decision support tools to assist them . METHODS To assess the effect of a decision aid ( DA ) about whether to continue or stop mammography screening for women aged 70 years , a population -based , r and omized controlled trial was conducted in New South Wales , Australia . Women aged 70 years who had regularly participated in mammography screening were eligible to participate in the trial . Women received a DA providing balanced , quantitative information or st and ard information available from the screening program . The main outcomes were the percentage of women making an informed choice about whether to continue or stop screening and the percentage of women participating in the screening . RESULTS Women who received the DA ( the intervention group ) were better informed than the control group ( mean increase in knowledge score out of 10 , 2.62 for the intervention group vs 0.68 for the control group ; P < .001 ) , and a significantly greater percentage made an informed choice ( 73.5 % vs 48.8 % ; P < .001 ) . The DA did not increase anxiety and slightly reduced decisional conflict . There was no difference in the percentage of women who participated in screening within 1 month . CONCLUSIONS This DA increased knowledge and assisted women to make an informed choice . It did not alter participation in screening . The DA is an effective way to assist women to make a decision about continuing mammography screening and seems to be a feasible intervention within a population screening program', \"BACKGROUND Decision-making about mode of birth after a cesarean delivery presents challenges to women and their caregivers and requires a balance of risks and benefits according to individual circumstances . The study objective was to determine whether a decision-aid for women who have experienced previous cesarean birth facilitates informed decision-making about birth options during a subsequent pregnancy . METHOD A prospect i ve multicenter r and omized controlled trial of 227 pregnant women was conducted within 3 prenatal clinics and 3 private obstetric practice s in New South Wales , Australia . Women with 1 previous cesarean section and medically eligible for trial of vaginal birth were recruited at 12 to 18 weeks ' gestation ; 115 were r and omized to the intervention group and 112 to the control group . A decision-aid booklet describing risks and benefits of elective repeat cesarean section and trial of labor was given to intervention group women at 28 weeks ' gestation . Main outcome measures included level of knowledge , decisional conflict score , women 's preference for mode of birth , and recorded mode of birth . RESULTS Women who received the decision-aid demonstrated a significantly greater increase in mean knowledge scores than the control group ( increasing by 2.17 vs 0.42 points on a 15-point scale ) ( p < 0.001 , 95 % CI for difference = 1.15 - 2.35 ) . The intervention group demonstrated a reduction in decisional conflict score ( p < 0.05 ) . The decision-aid did not significantly affect the rate of uptake of trial of labor or elective repeat cesarean section . Preferences expressed at 36 weeks were not consistent with actual birth outcomes for many women . CONCLUSION A decision-aid for women facing choices about birth after cesarean section is effective in improving knowledge and reducing decisional conflict . However , little evidence suggested that this process led to an informed choice . Strategies are required to better equip organizations and practitioners to empower women so that they can translate informed preferences into practice . Further work needs to examine ways to enhance women 's power in decision-making within the doctor-patient relationship\", 'BACKGROUND R and omized trials of bariatric surgery versus lifestyle treatment likely enroll highly motivated patients , which may limit the interpretation and generalizability of study findings . The objective of this study was to assess the feasibility of a population -based shared decision-making ( SDM ) approach to recruitment for a trial comparing laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery with intensive lifestyle intervention among adults with mild to moderate obesity and type 2 diabetes . METHODS Adult members with a body mass index ( BMI ) between 30 and 45 kg/m(2 ) taking diabetes medications were identified in electronic data bases and underwent a multiphase screening process . C and i date s were given a telephone survey , education about treatment options for obesity and diabetes using decision aids , and an SDM phone call with a nurse practitioner , in addition to st and ard office-based consent . RESULTS We identified 1808 members , and 828 ( 45.7 % ) had a BMI of 30 - 34.9 kg/m(2 ) . Among these , 1063 ( 59 % ) agreed to the telephone survey , 416 ( 23 % ) expressed interest in education about treatment options , and 277 ( 15 % ) completed the SDM process . The preferred treatment options were surgery ( 21 [ 8 % ] ) ,  diet and exercise  ( 149 [ 53.8 % ] ) , pharmacotherapy ( 5 [ 2 % ] ) , none of the above ( 8 [ 3 % ] ) , and unsure ( 94 [ 34 % ] ) . Ultimately , 43 participants were r and omly assigned to the trial . Significant differences , mainly related to sex , disease severity , and hypoglycemic medication use , were observed among people who did and did not agree to participate in our trial . CONCLUSION This population -based , SDM-based recruitment strategy successfully identified , enrolled , and r and omly assigned patients who had balanced views of surgery and lifestyle management . Even with this approach , selection biases may remain , highlighting the need for careful characterization of non participants in all future studies', 'This study sought to evaluate a shared decision-making aid for breast cancer prevention care design ed to help women make appropriate prevention decisions by presenting information about risk in context . The decision aid was implemented in a high-risk breast cancer prevention program and pilot-tested in a r and omized clinical trial comparing st and ard consultations to use of the decision aid .  Physicians completed training with the decision aid prior to enrollment . Thirty participants enrolled ( 15 per group ) and completed measures of clinical feasibility and effectiveness prior to , immediately after , and at 9 months after their consultations . The decision aid was feasible to use during the consultations as measured by consultation duration , user satisfaction , patient knowledge , and decisional conflict . The mean consultation duration was not significantly different between groups ( 24 minutes for intervention group versus 21 minutes for control group , p = 0.42 ) . The majority found the decision aid acceptable and useful and would recommend it to others . Both groups showed an improvement in breast cancer prevention knowledge postvisit , which was significant in the intervention group ( p = 0.01 ) but not the control group ( p = 0.13 ) . However , the knowledge scores returned to baseline at follow-up in both groups . Decision preference for patients who chose chemoprevention post consultations remained constant at follow-up for the intervention group , but not for the control group . The decision framework provides access to key information during consultations and facilitates the integration of emerging biomarkers in this setting . Initial results suggest that the decision aid is feasible for use in the consultation room . The tendency for the decision choices and knowledge scores to return to baseline at follow-up suggests the need for initial and ongoing prevention decision support', \"OBJECTIVE We assessed the short-term effects of a community-based intervention for Hispanic men to encourage informed decision making ( IDM ) about prostate cancer screening with prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) . METHODS All senior social and housing centers in El Paso , TX were r and omized to intervention , a group-based Spanish language educational program facilitated by promotores  ( 12 centers ; 161 men ) [ I 's ] , or to control , promotores-facilitated diabetes video and discussion  ( 13 centers ; 160 men ) [ C 's ] . RESULTS Participants had low levels of schooling and baseline knowledge ; 44 % reported previous PSA testing . At post-test , the I 's made large knowledge gains , increased their underst and ing that experts disagree about testing , shifted toward more active decision making roles , were more likely to believe that it is important to weigh the advantages and disadvantages of screening and to anticipate potential screening outcomes in making a decision , and were less likely to consider the screening decision easy . The I 's did not change in their screening intention or the belief that choosing not to be screened could be a responsible choice . CONCLUSIONS A community-based intervention to support IDM for prostate cancer screening can increase knowledge and may promote more active involvement in decision making about prostate cancer screening . Such an approach can increase knowledge and may promote more active involvement in decision making about prostate cancer screening . PRACTICE IMPLICATION S It is feasible to develop and implement a community-based intervention program to promote IDM for prostate cancer screening\", 'Purpose To compare the effects of three methods of values clarification ( VCM ) : balance sheet ; rating and ranking ; and a discrete choice experiment ( DCE ) on decision-making about  colorectal cancer ( CRC ) screening among adults in the US and Australia . Methods Using online panels managed by a survey research organization in the US and Australia , we recruited adults ages 50–75 at average risk for CRC for an online survey . Those eligible were r and omized to one of the three VCM tasks . CRC screening options were described in terms of five key attributes : reduction in risk of CRC incidence and mortality ; nature of the screening test ; screening frequency ; complications from screening ; and chance of requiring a colonoscopy ( as initial or follow-up testing ) . Main outcomes included self-reported most important attribute and unlabeled screening test preference by VCM and by country , assessed after the VCM . Results A total of 920 participants were enrolled ; 51 % were Australian ; mean age was 59.0 ; 87.0 % were white ; 34.2 % had a 4-year college degree ; 42.8 % had household incomes less than $ 45,000 USD per year ; 44.9 % were up to date with CRC screening . Most important attribute differed across VCM groups : the rating and ranking group was more likely to choose risk reduction as most important attribute ( 69.8 % ) than the balance sheet group ( 54.7 % ) or DCE ( 49.3 % ) , p < 0.0001 ; most important attribute did not vary by country ( p = 0.236 ) . The fecal occult blood test (FOBT)-like test was the most frequently preferred test overall ( 55.9 % ) . Unlabeled test choice did not differ meaningfully by VCM . Australians were more likely to prefer the FOBT ( AU 66.2 % vs. US 45.1 % , OR 2.4 , 95 % CI 1.8 , 3.1 ) . Few participants favored no screening ( US : 9.2 % , AU : 6.2 % ) . Conclusions Screening test attribute importance varied by VCM , but not by country . FOBT was more commonly preferred by Australians than by Americans , but test preferences were heterogeneous in both countries', \"BACKGROUND Patients vary widely in their preferences and capacity for participating in treatment decision-making . There are few interventions targeting patient underst and ing of how doctors make decisions and shared decision-making . This r and omized trial investigates the effects of providing cancer patients with a package design ed to facilitate shared decision-making prior to seeing their oncologist . PATIENTS AND METHODS Sixty-five female cancer patients were r and omized to receive either the  package ( booklet and 15-min video ) or a booklet on living with cancer  , before their initial consultation . Participants completed question naires prior to the intervention , immediately after the oncology consultation , and 2 weeks and 6 months later . The first consultation with the oncologist was audio-taped and transcribed . RESULTS Patients receiving the package were more likely than controls to declare their information and treatment preferences in the consultation , and their perspectives on the costs , side-effects and benefits of treatment . Doctors introduced considerably more new themes in the consultations with intervention subjects than they did with controls ; no other differences in doctor behaviour were noted . CONCLUSIONS This short intervention successfully shifted patient and doctor behaviour closer to the shared decision-making model , although it did not alter patients ' preferences for information or involvement\", 'Background . Eliciting patients ’ preferences within a framework of shared decision making ( SDM ) has been advocated as a strategy for increasing colorectal cancer ( CRC ) screening adherence . Our objective was to assess the effectiveness of a novel decision aid on SDM in the primary care setting . Methods . An interactive , computer-based decision aid for CRC screening was developed and evaluated within the context of a r and omized controlled trial . A total of 665 average-risk patients ( mean age , 57 years ; 60 % female ; 63 % black , 6 % Hispanic ) were allocated to 1 of 2 intervention arms ( decision aid alone , decision aid plus personalized risk assessment ) or a control arm . The interventions were delivered just prior to a scheduled primary care visit . Outcome measures ( patient preferences , knowledge , satisfaction with the decision-making process [ SDMP ] , concordance between patient preference and test ordered , and intentions ) were evaluated using pre study /post study visit question naires and electronic scheduling . Results . Overall , 95 % of patients in the intervention arms identified a preferred screening option based on values placed on individual test features . Mean cumulative knowledge , SDMP , and intention scores were significantly higher for both intervention groups compared with the control group . Concordance between patient preference and test ordered was 59 % . Patients who preferred colonoscopy were more likely to have a test ordered than those who preferred an alternative option ( 83 % v. 70 % ; P < 0.01 ) . Intention scores were significantly higher when the test ordered reflected patient preferences . Conclusions . Our interactive computer-based decision aid facilitates SDM , but overall effectiveness is determined by the extent to which providers comply with patient preferences', 'Background : A deeper engagement into medical decision-making is dem and ed by treatment guidelines for patients with affective disorders . There is to date little evidence on what facilitates active behaviour of patients with depression . In general medicine ‘ question prompt sheets ’ ( QPSs ) have been shown to change patients ’ behaviour in the consultation and improve treatment satisfaction but there is no evidence for such interventions for mental health setting s. Aims : To study the effects of a QPS on active patient behaviour in the consultation . Methods : R and omized controlled trial ( involving N = 100 out patients with depression ) evaluating the effects of a QPS on patients ’ behaviour in the consultation . Results : The QPS showed no influence on the number of topics raised by patients ( p = .13 ) nor on the external rater ’s perception of ‘ Who made the decisions in today ’s consultation ? ’ ( p = .50 ) . Conclusions : A QPS did not change  depressed patients ’ behaviour in the consultation . More complex interventions might be needed to change  depressed patients ’ behaviour within an established doctor – patient dyad . Patient seminars addressing behavioural aspects have been shown to be effective in other setting s and may also be feasible for out patients with affective disorders', 'OBJECTIVE Patient-centred depression care approaches should better address barriers of insufficient patient information and involvement in the treatment decision process . Additional research is needed to test the effect of increased patient participation on outcomes . The aim of this study was to assess , if patient participation in decision-making via a shared decision-making intervention leads to improved treatment adherence , satisfaction , and clinical outcome without increasing consultation time . METHODS Cluster-r and omized controlled intervention study based on physician training and patient-centered decision aid compared to usual care in primary care setting s in Südbaden region of Germany . Twenty-three primary care physicians treating 405 patients with newly diagnosed depression were enrolled . Patient involvement was measured with the patient perceived involvement in care scale ( PICS ) and a patient participation scale ( MSH-scale ) . Patient satisfaction was measured by the CSQ-8 question naire . Treatment adherence was evaluated by patient and provider self-report . Depression severity and remission outcomes were assessed with the Brief PHQ-D. RESULTS Physician facilitation of patient participation improved significantly and to a greater extent in the intervention compared to the control group . There was no intervention effect for depression severity reduction . Doctor facilitation of patient participation , patient-rated involvement , and physician assessment of adherence improved only in the intervention group . Patient satisfaction at post-intervention was higher in the intervention group compared to the control group . The consultation time did not differ between groups . CONCLUSION A shared decision-making intervention was better than usual care for improving patient participation in treatment decision-making , and patient satisfaction without increasing consultation time . Additional research is needed to model causal linkages in the decision-making process in regard to outcomes . PRACTICE IMPLICATION S The study results encourage the implementation of patient participation in primary care of depression', 'A decision aid for the surgical treatment of early breast cancer was evaluated in a r and omized controlled trial . The decision aid , a tape and workbook , includes explicit presentation of probabilities , photographs and graphics , and a values clarification exercise . Community surgeons were r and omized to use the decision aid or a control pamphlet .  Patients completed a question naire prior to using the decision aid , after review ing it but prior to surgery , and 6 months after enrollment . There was no difference in anxiety , knowledge , or decisional regret across the 2 groups . There was a nonsignificant trend toward lower decisional conflict in the decision aid group . A subgroup of women who were initially leaning toward mastectomy or were unsure had lower decisional conflict . Although the decision aid had minimal impact on the main study outcomes , a subgroup may have benefited . Such subgroups should be identified , and appropriate decision support interventions should be developed and evaluated', 'Study Design . A r and omized trial of 100 patients with low back pain who were potential surgical c and i date s. Objectives . To determine whether an interactive videodisc with a booklet is superior to a booklet alone for informing patients about back surgery . Summary of Background Data . Substantial geographic variation has been observed in lumbar spine surgery . Informed patient preferences should play an important role in decisions about surgery . However , little is known about optimal strategies for informing patients . Methods . Subjects were r and omized to receive an interactive videodisc ( with a booklet ) or a booklet alone . A knowledge test administered at baseline and follow-up was used to measure improvement in knowledge about treatment options for lumbar spine problems . Patients ’ reactions to the videodisc and booklet and preferences for treatment were also assessed . Results . The patients ’ knowledge improved after exposure to either intervention . Multivariate analyses adjusted for baseline score , age , education , gender , and diagnosis showed a significant advantage for the videodisc with booklet over the booklet alone . The videodisc – booklet group showed significantly greater gains in knowledge among subjects with the worst baseline knowledge scores . A larger proportion of subjects in the videodisc – booklet group rated the material s easy to underst and ( 93%vs.— 72%,P = 0.04 ) , containing the right amount of information ( 93%vs.— 80%,P = 0.3 ) , and adequate to assist in choice of treatment ( 75%vs.— 51%,P = 0.2 ) . Those who viewed the videodisc expressed a somewhat lower preference for surgery than those who received the booklet alone ( 23%vs.— 42%,P = 0.4 ) . Conclusions . Both the booklet alone and the combination of videodisc and booklet  improved knowledge . The combination produced greater knowledge gains than the booklet alone for the subgroup with the least knowledge at baseline . Patients preferred the combination and hada slightly lower preference for surgery if they hadviewed the videopresentation . For some patients , the video may enhance involvement in clinical decisions', 'Background . Increasingly , women with a strong family history of breast cancer are seeking genetic testing as a starting point to making significant decisions regarding management of their cancer risks . Individuals who are found to be carriers of a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation have a substantially elevated risk for breast cancer and are frequently faced with the decision of whether to undergo risk-reducing mastectomy . Objective . In order to provide BRCA1/2 carriers with ongoing decision support for breast cancer risk management , a computer-based interactive decision aid was developed and tested against usual care in a r and omized controlled trial . Design . Following genetic counseling , 214 female ( aged 21–75 years ) BRCA1/2 mutation carriers were r and omized to usual care  (  UC  ; n = 114 ) or  usual care plus decision aid  ( DA ; n = 100 ) arms . UC participants received no further intervention ; DA participants were sent the CD-ROM – based decision aid to view at home . Main Outcome Measures . The authors measured general distress , cancer-specific distress , and genetic testing – specific distress at 1- , 6- , and 12-month follow-up time points postr and omization . Results . Longitudinal analyses revealed a significant longitudinal impact of the DA on cancer-specific distress ( B = 5.67 , z = 2.81 , P = 0.005 ) , which varied over time ( DA group by time ; B = −2.19 , z = −2.47 , P = 0.01 ) , and on genetic testing – specific distress ( B = 5.55 , z = 2.46 , P = 0.01 ) , which also varied over time ( DA group by time ; B = −2.46 , z = −2.51 , P = 0.01 ) . Individuals r and omized to UC reported significantly decreased distress in the month following r and omization , whereas individuals r and omized to the DA maintained their postdisclosure distress over the short term . By 12 months , the overall decrease in distress between the 2 groups was similar . Conclusion . This report provides new insight into the long-term longitudinal effects of DAs', 'OBJECTIVE To assess whether provision of an educational DVD was more effective in increasing the uptake of elective single embryo transfers ( eSET ) than an educational brochure in an IVF population . DESIGN R and omized controlled trial . SETTING Private IVF clinic . PATIENT(S ) One hundred thirty-one couples starting their first cycle of IVF were r and omized to receive either an educational DVD or brochure . INTERVENTION(S ) Sixty-four couples received the DVD and 67 couples received the brochure . Both provided identical factual information on outcomes and risks of twin pregnancies . The DVD also included two short interviews with mothers of twins . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S ) Preference for eSET after the intervention . RESULT ( S ) There were no significant differences in fertility history or demographics . After the interventions , both groups demonstrated significantly improved knowledge . Patients in the DVD group were significantly more likely to prefer eSET compared with patients who read the brochure ( 82.6 % vs. 66.7 % ) . CONCLUSION ( S ) Patients exposed to the educational DVD were significantly more likely to prefer  eSET .  Provision of an educational DVD , such as the one used in the present study , may provide an affordable and more effective means of delivering health risk information', 'This study compared breastfeeding attitudes , intention , and initiation among low-income women exposed or not exposed to the Best Start program .  A between- ( experimental vs control group ) and within-factor ( pretest vs posttest ) repeated measures design was employed . A nonprobability sample of 54 subjects was r and omly assigned to a control group ( n = 28 ) or an experimental group ( n = 26 ) . Using the Breastfeeding Attrition Prediction Tool , statistically significant group by time interaction effects were found for negative breastfeeding sentiment , positive breastfeeding sentiment , and breastfeeding control scales . Compared to the control group , the experimental group had significantly increased positive breastfeeding sentiment ( P < .01 ) , decreased negative breastfeeding sentiment ( P < .01 ) , and increased breastfeeding control ( P < .01 ) from pretest to posttest . Following exposure to the Best Start program , subjects in the experimental group showed statistically significantly higher breastfeeding intention and initiation than did those in the control group . Practical implication s are discussed . J Hum Lact . 20(3):300 - 305', 'OBJECTIVE The objective of the study was to investigate the effect of a priori information on preferences for treatment elicited in a discrete choice experiment . METHODS A convenience sample of 100 subjects was r and omly split into two groups . The groups received minimal or extensive information on the treatment  of ankle and foot impairment in stroke . Then , they participated in a discrete choice experiment . Possible treatment was described using eight decision criteria with two to four levels each . Part-worth utility coefficients for the criteria levels , criteria importance and overall treatment preference were estimated . It was tested whether the amount of information that was received influenced the outcome of the discrete choice experiment . RESULTS In the extensively informed group fewer reversals in the expected order of part-worth utilities were found . Criteria importance for four of the eight criteria and criteria importance ranking between the minimally and extensively informed subject groups were significantly different . The difference in part-worth utility of the levels had a minor effect on the predicted utility of the available treatments . CONCLUSION The lower number of level rank reversals in the extensively informed subjects indicates a better underst and ing of outcome desirability and thus a better underst and ing of the decision task . The effect of more extensive information on predicted treatment preference was minimal . PRACTICE IMPLICATION S While interpreting the results of a discrete choice experiment , the effect of prior knowledge on the decision problem has to be taken into account . Although information seems to increase the underst and ing of the decision task , outcomes valuation can also be directed by information and more extensive information increases the cognitive burden which is placed on the subjects . Future research should focus on the exact nature and size of the effects and the results of this study should be clinical ly vali date', \"Although practice guidelines suggest that postmenopausal women learn about the benefits and nsks and consider their values when deciding about hormone therapy , the optimal decision-support method has not been established . In a r and omized controlled trial , the authors compared the efficacy of a general educational pamphlet with that of a tailored decision aid . The pamphlet briefly summarized benefits , risks , and likely beneficiaries in general terms . The decision aid , delivered via booklet and audiotape , provided : detailed benefits and risks using functional terms and probabilities tailored to clinical risk ; and steps for considering the issue in a woman 's own situation , including a value-clarification exercise . Compared with the pamphlet group , the decision-aid group had statistically significant ( p < 0.05 ) improvements in terms of realistic personal expectations of the benefits and nsks , decisional conflict , and perceived acceptability of the intervention . Levels of general knowledge about the main benefits and nsks were comparable for the two interventions It is concluded that tailored decision aids prepare women for decision making better than do general pamphlets .

Most primary care physicians , however , routinely order a prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) test with little or no discussion about whether they believe the potential benefits justify the risk of harm . We sought to assess whether educating primary care physicians and activating their patients to ask about prostate cancer screening had a synergistic effect on shared decision making , rates and types of discussion s about prostate cancer screening , and the physician ’s final recommendations . METHODS Our study was a cluster r and omized controlled trial among primary care physicians and their patients , comparing usual education ( control ) , with physician education alone ( MD-Ed ) , and with physician education and patient activation ( MD-Ed+A ) .  Participants included 120 physicians in 5 group practice s , and 712 male patients aged 50 to 75 years . The interventions comprised a Web-based educational program for all intervention physicians and MD-Ed+A patients compared with usual education ( brochures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ) . The primary outcome measure was patients ’ reported postvisit shared decision making regarding prostate cancer screening ; secondary measures included unannounced st and ardized patients ’ reported shared decision making and the physician ’s recommendation for prostate cancer screening . RESULTS Patients ’ ratings of shared decision making were moderate and did not differ between groups . MD-Ed+A patients reported that physicians had higher prostate cancer screening discussion rates ( MD-Ed+A = 65 % , MD-Ed = 41 % , control=38 % ; P < .01 ) . St and ardized patients reported that physicians seeing MD-Ed+A patients were more neutral during prostate cancer screening recommendations ( MD-Ed+A=50 % , MD-Ed=33 % , control=15 % ; P < .05 ) . Of the male patients , 80 % had had previous PSA tests . CONCLUSIONS Although activating physicians and patients did not lead to significant changes in all aspects of physician attitudes and behaviors that we studied , interventions that involved physicians did have a large effect on their attitudes toward screening and in the discussion s they had with patients , including their being more likely than control physicians to engage in prostate cancer screening discussion s and more likely to be neutral in their final recommendations', 'OBJECTIVES ( a ) To determine which of two values clarification exercises ( VCE ) , based on theoretical decision rules used naturally by people , would be more helpful to patients making a treatment decision and ( b ) to evaluate the convergent validity of the most helpful VCE when part of a decision aid for the treatment of early-stage prostate cancer . METHODS Two studies were completed . Study 1 : Ninety community volunteers were assigned at r and om to one of three groups and all made a hypothetical treatment decision . Two groups received VCEs , one with a summary and one without , and the third was a control group . Study 2 : In a multi-centre phase II trial , 69 patients used the decision aid  that included the exercise ranked most helpful in Study 1 . Decision aid assessment s included the decisional conflict scale , treatment valuation assessment and regret . RESULTS Study 1 : Most participants in each group ranked the  VCE  with the summary as most helpful . Study 2 : VCE outputs , such as the size of the summary , were associated in predictable ways with the decision aid assessment s. CONCLUSION The VCE ranked most helpful in Study 1 showed convergent validity with decision aid assessment s. PRACTICE IMPLICATION S With the interpretation of the VCE outputs now vali date d , a r and omized controlled trial is required to determine if the exercise helps patients more than the aid without the exercise', 'OBJECTIVE : Guidelines for fetal aneuploidy testing recommend that screening and diagnostic testing be made available to pregnant women of all ages and that providers explain the differences between these tests to help their patients make informed testing decisions . We sought to estimate the effect of a computerized , interactive prenatal testing decision tool on prenatal testing decision making . METHODS : Four hundred ninety-six English- or Spanish-speaking women at 20 or fewer weeks of gestation were r and omly assigned to view the interactive prenatal testing decision tool or the California Department of Health Services ’ educational booklet . Primary outcomes were knowledge , risk awareness , intervention satisfaction , decisional conflict , and among women aged at least 35 years , use of invasive diagnostic testing . RESULTS : Women assigned to the interactive prenatal testing decision tool had higher knowledge scores ( 79.5 % compared with 64.9 % , P<.001 ) , were more likely to correctly estimate their risk of procedure-related miscarriage ( 64.9 % compared with 48.1 % , P=.002 ) and carrying a Down syndrome-affected fetus ( 63.5 % compared with 15.1 % , P<.001 ) , were more satisfied with the intervention ( P<.001 ) , and had less decision uncertainty ( P<.001 ) than controls after viewing the intervention . Most of these differences persisted over time . Among women aged at least 35 years , the interactive prenatal testing decision tool viewers who were originally less inclined to undergo invasive testing were ultimately more likely than similarly inclined controls to have amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling ( 44.8 % compared with 29.2 % ) , whereas those who were originally more inclined to undergo an invasive procedure ultimately were less likely than similarly inclined controls to have a diagnostic procedure ( 84.6 % compared with 94.9 % ; P=.015 for interaction ) . CONCLUSION : Using an interactive prenatal testing decision tool results in more informed prenatal genetic testing decisions than viewing st and ard educational booklets . CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION : Clinical trials.gov , www . clinical trials.gov , NCT00686062 LEVEL OF EVIDENCE :', \"BACKGROUND Most medical associations recommend that patients make informed decisions about whether to be screened for prostate cancer with the prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) test . Studies assessing how to promote PSA informed decision-making ( IDM ) have been conducted almost exclusively in healthcare setting s ; there is a need for similar research in community setting s. METHODS This paper describes the results of a 5-year study ( 2002 - -2007 ) in which two community-level interventions  were developed , implemented , and evaluated in matched upper- and lower-SES comparison communities in Greensboro and Wilmington , North Carolina . Both interventions promoted PSA informed decision-making . One intervention ( PSA-Only ) consisted of educational information about prostate cancer and the PSA test , and the other ( Men 's Health ) included additional information about recognizing and preventing heart attack , stroke , and colon cancer . Structured survey , semistructured interview , and structured observational data were combined to compare participating community residents ' pre/post changes in knowledge , intentions , and behaviors related to PSA IDM . RESULTS The community-level interventions successfully engaged community participants in discussion s , educated individuals , encouraged deliberation of information , and facilitated PSA test discussion s with physicians .  Men who participated in the PSA-Only educational sessions  were more likely than those who attended the Men 's  Health educational sessions to discuss the PSA test with their physician ( p=0.037 ) . CONCLUSIONS When prospect i ve SES-related confounding factors are matched across comparison communities , PSA IDM interventions can be shown to promote IDM . Framing the PSA test decision relative to less-ambiguous screening decisions does not appear to increase the likelihood of PSA IDM\", \"OBJECTIVES To evaluate the impact of a decision aid for women considering genetic testing for breast/ovarian cancer risk given during genetic counseling . METHODS One hundred and forty-eight women were r and omized to receive the decision aid or a control pamphlet at the beginning of their first consultation with a genetic counselor . When the patient received the decision aid , it was used to complement consultation discussion s about genetic testing . One hundred and ten ( 74.3 % ) women completed the first question naire design ed to elicit information about women 's levels of decisional conflict and knowledge about genetic testing . Of these , 105 ( 70.9 % ) completed a second question naire to assess longer-term outcomes , 6 months postconsultation . RESULTS Results showed that women who received the decision aid felt more informed about genetic testing ( chi(2)(1)=8.69 ; P=0.003 ) , had clearer values ( chi(2)(1)=6.90 ; P=0.009 ) and had higher knowledge levels ( chi(2)(2)=6.49 ; P=0.039 ) than women who received the control pamphlet . CONCLUSIONS The developed decision aid improved patient outcomes better than a control pamphlet when implemented during genetic counseling and given to the patient to take home\", \"OBJECTIVES In advanced dementia , feeding problems are nearly universal , and families face difficult decisions about feeding options . Initial interviews for a r and omized trial were used to describe surrogates ' perceptions of feeding options , and to determine whether a decision aid on feeding options in advanced dementia would improve knowledge , reduce expectation of benefit from tube feeding , and reduce conflict over treatment choices for persons with advanced dementia . DESIGN Semistructured interview with pre study and post study design for surrogates in the intervention group . SETTING Twenty-four skilled nursing facilities across North Carolina participating in a cluster r and omized trial . PARTICIPANTS Two hundred and fifty-five surrogate decision makers for nursing home residents with advanced dementia and feeding problems , in control ( n = 129 ) and intervention ( n = 126 ) groups . INTERVENTION For intervention surrogates only , an audiovisual-print decision aid provided information on dementia , feeding problems in dementia , advantages and disadvantages of feeding tubes or assisted oral feeding options , and the role of surrogates in making these decisions . MEASUREMENTS The interview included open-ended items asking surrogates to report advantages and disadvantages of tube feeding and assisted oral feeding .  Knowledge of feeding options was measured with 19 true/false items and items measuring expectation of benefit from tube feeding . Surrogates reported which of these two feeding options they preferred for the person with dementia , and how confident they were in this choice ; their level of conflict about the choice was measured using the decisional conflict scale . RESULTS Before the decision aid , surrogates described advantages and disadvantages of assisted oral feeding and tube feeding in practical , ethical , and medical terms . After review of the decision aid , intervention surrogates had improved knowledge scores ( 15.5 vs 16.8 ; P < .001 ) , decreased expectation of benefits from tube feeding ( 2.73 vs 2.32 ; P = .001 ) , and reduced decisional conflict ( 2.24 vs 1.91 ; P < .001 ) . Surrogates preferred assisted oral feeding  initially and reported more certainty about this choice after the decision aid . CONCLUSIONS A structured decision aid can be used to improve decision making about feeding options in dementia care\", 'Objectives The aim of this study was to evaluate if the addition of a decision aid ( DA ) decreases decisional conflict in women presenting for the management and treatment of pelvic organ prolapse ( POP ) . Methods Women scheduled for the evaluation and management of POP were r and omized into either of 2 groups : st and ard counseling ( SC ) alone ( n = 51 ) or SC plus a DA ( n = 53 ) . Upon completion of their initial visit , patients filled out a 16-item decisional conflict scale and short form general health survey . Values were assessed for normality and compared between groups . Normally distributed , continuous data were evaluated with a Student t test . A & khgr;2 test was used to compare selected categorical characteristics between groups . Differences in distributions of low and high decisional conflict were assessed with a Mann-Whitney U test . Results One hundred four women were r and omized for this analysis . Baseline characteristics , including pelvic prolapse examination measurements , did not significantly differ between groups . The addition of a DA to SC did not significantly lower the level decisional conflict patients faced when deciding on a treatment plan ( P = 0.566 ) . There were no significant differences between groups in the following subscores : uncertainty , values clarity , support , effective decision , and informed . In addition , there were no between-group differences in choice of treatment plan ( conservative management , pelvic floor physical therapy , pessary , and surgery ; P = 0.835 ) . Conclusions In this relatively small sample , the addition of a DA to SC for women with POP does not significantly decrease the level of decisional conflict in making treatment-related decisions', \"This study examined the immediate effects of exposure to a patient education brochure concerning the risks and benefits of zidovudine ( ZDV ) therapy during pregnancy to reduce perinatal HIV transmission ( protocol ACTG 076 ) on related knowledge , behavioural intentions and attitudes of women with and at-risk for HIV-infection . Self-reports were collected from 653 women of childbearing age from community family planning clinics and hospital-based HIV centres in 19 sites from nine US cities between May and November 1995 . The intervention was a nine-page patient education brochure in Spanish , Creole and English versions , evently presenting the pros and cons of ZDV therapy to reduce perinatal HIV-transmission . Brochure exposure increased knowledge ( p < 0.001 ) for all but one scale concerning ZDV resistance and increased the likelihood of women reporting intentions to take ZDV during pregnancy ( p < 0.001 ) and to believe ZDV reduced transmission ( p < 0.001 ) . Brochure exposure had differential effects for some sub population s. Intentions to have or terminate current or future pregnancies , knowledge about ZDV and attitudes toward ZDV varied mostly by ethnicity/race , language preference and HIV status . Pregnancy status , age , education and having an HIV-positive child had less impact on the brochure 's effect , while income had no impact\", 'Background Despite evidence that decision and communication aids are effective for enhancing the quality of preference-sensitive decisions , their adoption in the field of orthopaedic surgery has been limited . The purpose of this mixed- methods study was to evaluate the perceived value of decision and communication aids among different healthcare stakeholders . Methods Patients with hip or knee arthritis , orthopaedic surgeons who perform hip and knee replacement procedures , and a group of large , self-insured employers ( healthcare purchasers ) were surveyed regarding their views on the value of decision and communication aids in orthopaedics . Patients with hip or knee arthritis who participated in a r and omized controlled trial involving decision and communication aids  were asked to complete an online survey about what was most and least beneficial about each of the tools they used , the ideal mode of administration of these tools and services , and their interest in receiving comparable material s and services in the future . A subset of these patients were invited to participate in a telephone interview , where there were asked to rank and attribute a monetary value to the interventions . These interviews were analyzed using a qualitative and mixed methods analysis software . Members of the American Hip and Knee Surgeons ( AAHKS ) were surveyed on their perceptions and usage of decision and communication aids in orthopaedic practice . Healthcare purchasers were interviewed about their perspectives on patient-oriented decision support . Results All stakeholders saw value in decision and communication aids , with the major barrier to implementation being cost . Both patients and surgeons would be willing to bear at least part of the cost of implementing these tools , while employers felt health plans should be responsible for shouldering the costs . Conclusions Decision and communication aids can be effective tools for incorporating patients preferences and values into preference-sensitive decisions in orthopaedics . Future efforts should be aim ed at assessing strategies for efficient implementation of these tools into widespread orthopaedic practice', \"IMPORTANCE Prenatal genetic testing guidelines recommend providing patients with detailed information to allow informed , preference-based screening and diagnostic testing decisions . The effect of implementing these guidelines is not well understood . OBJECTIVE To analyze the effect of a decision-support guide and elimination of financial barriers to testing on use of prenatal genetic testing and decision making among pregnant women of varying literacy and numeracy levels . DESIGN , SETTING , AND PARTICIPANTS R and omized trial conducted from 2010 - 2013 at prenatal clinics at 3 county hospitals , 1 community clinic , 1 academic center , and 3 medical centers of an integrated health care delivery system in the San Francisco Bay area . Participants were English- or Spanish-speaking women who had not yet undergone screening or diagnostic testing and remained pregnant at 11 weeks ' gestation ( n = 710 ) . INTERVENTIONS A computerized , interactive decision-support guide and access to prenatal testing with no out-of-pocket expense ( n = 357 ) or usual care as per current guidelines ( n = 353 ) . MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was invasive diagnostic test use , obtained via medical record review . Secondary outcomes included testing strategy undergone , and knowledge about testing , risk comprehension , and decisional conflict and regret at 24 to 36 weeks ' gestation . RESULTS Women r and omized to the intervention group , compared with those r and omized to the control group , were less likely to have invasive diagnostic testing ( 5.9 % vs 12.3 % ; odds ratio [ OR ] , 0.45 [ 95 % CI , 0.25 - 0.80 ] ) and more likely to forgo testing altogether ( 25.6 % vs 20.4 % ; OR , 3.30 [ 95 % CI , 1.43 - 7.64 ] , reference group screening followed by invasive testing ) . Women r and omized to the intervention group also had higher knowledge scores ( 9.4 vs 8.6 on a 15-point scale ; mean group difference , 0.82 [ 95 % CI , 0.34 - 1.31 ] ) and were more likely to correctly estimate the amniocentesis-related miscarriage risk ( 73.8 % vs 59.0 % ; OR , 1.95 [ 95 % CI , 1.39 - 2.75 ] ) and their estimated age-adjusted chance of carrying a fetus with trisomy 21 ( 58.7 % vs 46.1 % ; OR , 1.66 [ 95 % CI , 1.22 - 2.28 ] ) . Significant differences did not emerge in decisional conflict or regret . CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Full implementation of prenatal testing guidelines using a computerized , interactive decision-support guide in the absence of financial barriers to testing result ed in less test use and more informed choices . If vali date d in additional population s , this approach may result in more informed and preference-based prenatal testing decision making and fewer women undergoing testing .

We assessed the impact of the PDS on ( 1 ) consistency between the decision to take estrogen replacement therapy ( ERT ) or progesterone/estrogen replacement therapy ( PERT ) and the expected utility of treatment and ( 2 ) likelihood to take ERT and PERT pre- and postintervention . DESIGN Content of the PDS was st and ardized . R and omized trial of three intensities of intervention : ( 1 ) brochure ; ( 2 ) lecture/ discussion ; and ( 3 ) active decision support . SUBJECTS Participants were perimenopausal community volunteers between the ages of 40 and 65 ( n = 248 ) . MEASURES ( 1 ) Consistent with values ( correlation between expected utility ( EU ) and likelihood of taking hormones ) ; and ( 2 ) Likelihood to take hormone replacement therapy . RESULTS ( 1 ) The brochure group was less consistent with the decision analytic model than the lecture/ discussion and active decision support groups . ( 2 ) Influence on decisions : PDS tools increased the number of women certain about whether or not to take hormones . There were no differences among experimental groups . Of 99 women uncertain about ERT pre-PDS , 65 % changed . Twenty-one ( 32 % ) decided against ERT and 44 ( 68 % ) decided for ERT . ( 3 ) More intensive interventions produced modest gains in a normative direction . CONCLUSIONS PDSs using any of 3 formats reduce uncertainty and assist women to make informed decisions . Increased consistency with decision analytic models appears to be driven by better estimates of likelihood of outcomes', 'OBJECTIVE To evaluate an entertainment-based patient decision aid for prostate cancer screening among patients with low or high health literacy . METHODS Male primary care patients from two clinical sites , one characterized as serving patients with low health literacy ( n=149 ) and the second as serving patients with high health literacy ( n=301 ) , were r and omized to receive an entertainment-based decision aid for prostate cancer screening or an audiobooklet-control aid with the same learner content but without the entertainment features . Postintervention and 2-week follow-up assessment s were conducted . RESULTS Patients at the low-literacy site were more engaged with the entertainment-based aid than patients at the high-literacy site . Overall , knowledge improved for all patients . Among patients at the low-literacy site , the entertainment-based aid was associated with lower decisional conflict and greater self-advocacy ( i.e. , mastering and obtaining information about screening ) when compared to patients given the audiobooklet . No differences between the aids were observed for patients at the high-literacy site . CONCLUSION Entertainment education may be an effective strategy for promoting informed decision making about prostate cancer screening among patients with lower health literacy . PRACTICE IMPLICATION S As barriers to implementing computer-based patient decision support programs decrease , alternative models for delivering these programs should be explored', \"Purpose . To compare the effectiveness of an individualized decision aid ( DA ) with st and ard educational material s on decisions about menopausal treatments and to assess the feasibility of integrating this DA into clinical practice , with and without coaching . Methods . We conducted a 3-armed r and omized controlled trial in 3 clinics , enrolling menopausal women between the ages of 45 and 65 years with primary care appointments . Of the 145 women included , 99 completed a 2-week follow-up . The control group received generic educational material s , 1 intervention group received an individualized computer-generated DA mailed to patients and their clinicians before clinic appointment , and the 2nd intervention group received the same DA along with coached care before clinic appointment ( DA + CC ) .  Decisional conflict , satisfaction , and knowledge were measured 2 weeks after clinic appointment . Results . Participants ' mean age was 52 years , and 97 % were white . Most women ( 98 % ) read all or most of the documents . Decisional conflict was significantly lower in both intervention groups but not in the control group . DA  reduced decisional conflict from preintervention to postintervention ( pre — post change ) by 0.70 ( SD = 0.56 ) points ( on a 1—5 scale ) , compared to reductions of 0.51 ( SD = 0.51 ) and 0.09 ( SD = 0.44 ) for the DA + CC group and the control group , respectively . Satisfaction with the decision made was significantly higher at 2 weeks in the DA v. control group . Self-reported knowledge significantly improved in DA + CC compared to controls . Conclusion . Our decision aid lowered decisional conflict and improved patient satisfaction ; adding coaching provided little additional benefit\", \"A r and omised trial was carried out to assess the effect of a  Down syndrome screening video on test uptake , knowledge and psychological stress .  A total of 2000 women referred for antenatal care were allocated to two equal groups : one to be sent a video to their home , before their hospital booking visit , and a control group . All women also received screening information in the form of a leaflet before booking and from a midwife at booking . The video had no effect on the screening uptake rate : 638/993 ( 64.2 % ) and 652/1007 ( 64.7 % ) in the video and control groups , respectively . Women were requested to return the video for reuse in other pregnancies and 612 ( 62 % ) did so . A subset of 1200 women were selected to be posted at 17 - 19 weeks ' gestation a self-completed question naire to assess the psychological endpoints . Knowledge of screening was increased in the video group with a mean score of 7.3 compared with 6.7 in the controls , a statistically significant difference ( t=3.24 , p=0.0005 ) . There were no significant differences between the groups in specific worries about abnormalities in the baby , and general anxiety . We conclude that a video can increase knowledge without affecting the uptake of the test , or psychological stress\", 'OBJECTIVE To describe how clinicians use decision aids . BACKGROUND A 98-patient factorial- design r and omized trial of the Statin Choice decision vs. st and ard educational pamphlet ; each participant had a 1:4 chance of receiving the decision aid during the encounter with the clinician result ing in 22 eligible encounters . DESIGN Two research ers working independently and in duplicate review ed and coded the 22 encounter videos . SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS Twenty-two patients with diabetes ( 57 % of them on statins ) and six endocrinologists working in a referral diabetes clinic r and omly assigned to use the decision aid during the consultation . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Proportion and nature of unintended use of the Statin Choice decision aid .  RESULTS We found eight encounters involving six clinicians who did not use the decision aid as intended either by not using it at all ( n = 5 ; one clinician did use the decision aid in three encounters ) , offering inaccurate quantitative and probabilistic information about the risks and benefits of statins ( n = 2 ) , or using the decision aid to advance the agenda that all patients with diabetes should take statin ( n = 1 ) . Clinicians used the decision aid as intended in all other encounters . CONCLUSIONS Unintended decision aid use in the context of videotaped encounters in a practical r and omized trial was common . These instances offer insights to research ers seeking to design and implement effective decision aids for use during the clinical visit , particularly when clinicians may prefer to proceed in ways that the decision aid apparently contradicts', 'An evaluation of the long term impact of a health education intervention in primary care , for premenopausal women ( 45 years of age ) , is presented . The intervention included information and group discussion about menopause , stress management , health behaviours ( smoking , exercise , diet ) and treatment choices . Question naires were sent to 86 women who had been r and omised into two groups ( prepared/control ) and were now aged 50 ( response rate 91 % ) . The prepared group had significantly greater knowledge of menopause and attributed fewer symptoms to the menopause than the controls . There were no group differences in measures of general health or mood , but there was a tendency for the prepared group to report more interest in sexual activity . Subjective evaluation of the intervention was positive in terms of increasing knowledge and helping women to deal with the emotional and practical aspects of the menopause', 'Objective To assess the effects of a patient oriented decision aid for prioritising treatment goals in diabetes compared with usual care on patient empowerment and treatment decisions . Design Pragmatic r and omised controlled trial . Setting 18 general practice s in the north of the Netherl and s. Participants 344 patients with type 2 diabetes aged ≤65 years at the time of diagnosis and managed in primary care between April 2011 and August 2012 : 225 were allocated to the intervention group and 119 to the usual care group . Intervention The intervention comprised a decision aid for people with diabetes , with individually tailored risk information and treatment options for multiple risk factors . The aid was intended to empower patients to prioritise between clinical domains and to support treatment decisions . It was offered to participants before a regular diabetes check-up and to their healthcare provider during the consultation . Four different formats of the decision aid were included for additional explorative analyses . Main outcome measures The primary outcome was the effects on patient empowerment for setting and achieving goals . The secondary outcomes were changes in the prescribing of drugs to regulate glucose , blood pressure , lipids , and albuminuria . Data were collected through structured question naires and automated data extraction from electronic health records during six months before and after the intervention . Results Of all intervention participants , 103 ( 46 % ) reported to have received the basic elements of the intervention . For the primary outcome analysis , 199 intervention and 107 control patients with sufficient baseline and follow-up data could be included . The mean empowerment score increased 0.1 on a 5 point scale in the overall intervention group , which was not significantly different from that of the control group ( mean difference after adjusting for baseline 0.039 , 95 % confidence interval −0.056 to 0.134 ) . Lipid regulating drug treatment was intensified in 25 % of intervention and 12 % of control participants with increased cholesterol levels , which did not reach significance when the intervention was compared with the usual care group ( odds ratio 2.54 , 95 % confidence interval 0.89 to 7.23 ) . Prespecified explorative analyses showed that this effect was significant for the printed version of the decision aid in comparison to usual care ( 3.90 , 1.29 to 11.80 ) . No relevant or significant changes were seen for other treatments . Conclusion We found no evidence that the patient oriented treatment decision aid  improves patient empowerment by an important amount . The aid was not used to its full extent in a substantial number of participants . Trial registration Dutch trial register NTR1942', \"R and omised evaluations of re sources to facilitate informed decisions about prostate cancer screening are rarely conducted . In this study , 421 men recruited from the community were r and omly allocated to receive a leaflet ( n = 140 ) or one of two re sources meeting criteria for a decision-aid : a video ( n = 141 ) or an evidence -based booklet , developed by the authors ( n = 140 ) . Men in all three groups demonstrated significant increases in knowledge scores from pre to post-test . Scores were significantly higher at post-test amongst those who had received our evidence -based booklet compared with men who received the leaflet or video ( P < 0.001 ) . Scores were significantly modified by men 's preferences for decisional control ( P = 0.002 ) . Decisional conflict was significantly lower amongst men receiving the evidence -based booklet ( P = 0.038 ) . Men receiving the evidence -based booklet also were less likely to accept a recommendation by a GP to undergo prostate-specific-antigen ( PSA ) screening ( P = 0.003 ) . Men require detailed information about the pros and cons of PSA screening in order to make an informed decision . Re sources are not equivalent in achieving these outcomes\", 'BACKGROUND Many people who are depressed do not receive any professional help and their beliefs about the helpfulness of treatment do not always correspond with those of health professionals . To facilitate choices about treatment , the present study examined the effects of providing depressed people in the community with evidence on whether various treatment options work . METHOD A r and omized controlled trial was carried out with 1094 persons selected at r and om from the community who screened positive for depressive symptoms and agreed to participate . Participants were mailed either an evidence -based consumer guide to treatments for depression or , as a control , a general brochure on depression . Outcomes were the rated usefulness of the information provided , changes in attitudes to depression treatments , actions taken to reduce depression , and changes in depressive symptoms , anxiety symptoms and disability . RESULTS Participants rated the evidence -based consumer guide as more useful than the control brochure . Attitudes to some treatments changed . Improvements in symptoms and disability did not differ significantly between interventions . CONCLUSION Providing people who are depressed with evidence on which treatments work produces some changes in attitudes and behaviour . However , this intervention may need to be enhanced if it is to produce symptom change', \"BACKGROUND Prostate cancer screening with serum prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) and digital rectal examination ( DRE ) continues to increase . Our goal was to test the effect of a prostate cancer screening decision-aid on patients ' knowledge , beliefs , and use of prostate cancer screening tests . METHODS Our study was a r and omized controlled trial of a prostate cancer screening decision-aid consisting of an illustrated pamphlet as opposed to a comparison intervention .  We included 257 men aged 50 to 80 years who were receiving primary care at a Department of Veterans Affairs Hospital in Milwaukee , Wisconsin . The decision-aid provided quantitative outcomes of prostate cancer screening with DRE and PSA . We subsequently evaluated prostate cancer screening knowledge , beliefs , and test use . RESULTS The illustrated pamphlet decision-aid was effective in improving knowledge of prostate cancer screening tests : 95 % of the experimental group were aware of the possibility of false-negative test results compared with 85 % of the comparison group ( P < .01 ) . Ninety-one percent of the experimental group were aware of the possibility of a false-positive screening test result compared with 65 % of the comparison group ( P < .01 ) . However , there was no difference in the use of prostate cancer screening between the experimental ( 82 % ) and comparison ( 84 % ) groups , ( P > .05 ) . CONCLUSIONS When used in a primary care setting , an illustrated pamphlet decision-aid was effective in increasing knowledge of prostate cancer screening tests but did not change the use of these tests\", 'OBJECTIVE To describe relationships between use of the Personal Patient Profile-Prostate ( P3P ) decision support system and patient characteristics , and perceived preparation for decision making ( PrepDM ) , satisfaction and decisional regret in the context of prostate cancer treatment choice . METHODS 494 men with localized prostate cancer ( LPC ) were r and omized to receive the P3P intervention or usual care and completed pre-treatment , 1-month and 6-month outcome measures . Multivariable linear regression models were fit for each outcome . RESULTS Physician consult visits prior to enrollment , race/ethnicity , and use of clinic-provided books were significant predictors of perceived PrepDM at 1 month . Prior Internet use and PrepDM significantly predicted 6-month decision satisfaction . Decisional regret was significantly predicted by demographics , anxiety , PrepDM score , and EPIC bowel domain score at 6 months . Use of P3P did not predict any outcome . CONCLUSION While the P3P intervention did not significantly affect the outcomes , pre-enrollment information and preparation were strong predictors of the 1- and 6-month outcomes . Decision regret was significantly influenced by personal characteristics and post-treatment symptoms/side effects . PRACTICE IMPLICATION S Information received and used between biopsy and the treatment options consult visit is likely to make a difference in decision satisfaction', 'The authors investigated the feasibility of using computer-assisted instruction in patients of varying literacy levels by examining patients ’ preferences for learning and their ability to use 2 computer-based educational programs . A total of 263 participants 50–74 years of age with varying health literacy levels interacted with 1 of 2 educational computer programs as part of a r and omized trial of a colorectal cancer screening decision aid . A baseline and postprogram evaluation survey were completed . More than half ( 56 % ) of the participants had limited health literacy . Regardless of literacy level , doctors were the most commonly used source of medical information — used frequently by 85 % of limited and adequate literacy patients . In multivariate logistic regression , only those with health insurance ( OR = 2.35 , p = .06 ) and computer use experience ( OR = 0.39 , p = .03 ) predicted the ability to complete the programs without assistance compared with those without health insurance or prior computer use , respectively . Although patients with limited health literacy had less computer experience , the majority completed the programs without any assistance and stated that they learned more than they would have from a brochure . Future research should investigate ways that computer-assisted instruction can be incorporated in medical care to enhance patient underst and ing', \"PURPOSE Many patients with locally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer ( LA-NSCLC ) are eligible for combined-modality therapy ( CMT ; chemotherapy and radiotherapy ) . Although CMT offers slightly higher chances of survival than radiotherapy alone ( RT ) , it also carries a higher probability of toxicity , raising the possibility that some patients may prefer to decline CMT . We report a pilot study of a decision aid design ed for patients in this setting . PATIENTS AND METHODS The aid included a structured description of the treatment options and trade-off exercises design ed to help clarify the patient 's values for the relevant outcomes by determining the patient 's survival advantage threshold ( SAT ; the increase in survival conferred by CMT over RT that the patient deemed necessary for choosing CMT ) . Additional outcome measures included each patient 's strength of treatment preference , decisional conflict , objective underst and ing of survival information , and decisional role preference . RESULTS Twenty-seven patients met the eligibility criteria for the study . Of these , seven declined the decision aid because they had a clear treatment preference . The remaining 20 participants completed the decision aid ; 18 chose CMT , and two chose RT . All 20 patients wished to participate in the decision to some extent . All patients reported that using the decision support was useful to them and recommended its use for others . No patient or physician reported that the aid interfered with the physician-patient relationship . Patients ' 3-year SATs and median SATs were each strongly correlated with their strengths of treatment preference ( rho = 0.83 , P < .001 and rho = 0.67 , P = .02 , respectively ) . For all but one patient , either their 3-year or median survival threshold was consistent with their final treatment choice . Ten patients reported a stronger treatment preference after using the decision aid . CONCLUSION We conclude that implementing the decision-aid for patients with LA-NSCLC is feasible , that it demonstrates convergent validity , and that it is favorably evaluated by patients and their physicians . The aid seems to help patients underst and the benefits and risks of treatment and to choose the treatment that is most consistent with their values . Further evaluation of the aid is warranted\", 'IMPORTANCE The conflicting recommendations for prostate cancer ( PCa ) screening and the mixed messages communicated to the public about screening effectiveness make it critical to assist men in making informed decisions . OBJECTIVE To assess the effectiveness of 2 decision aids in helping men make informed PCa screening decisions . DESIGN , SETTING , AND PARTICIPANTS A racially diverse group of male out patients aged 45 to 70 years from 3 sites were interviewed by telephone at baseline , 1 month , and 13 months , from 2007 through 2011 . We conducted intention-to-treat univariate analyses and multivariable linear and logistic regression analyses , adjusting for baseline outcome measures . INTERVENTION R and om assignment to print-based decision aid ( n = 628 ) , web-based interactive decision aid ( n = 625 ) , or usual care ( UC ) ( n = 626 ) . MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Prostate cancer knowledge , decisional conflict , decisional satisfaction , and whether participants underwent PCa screening . RESULTS Of 4794 eligible men approached , 1893 were r and omized . At each follow-up assessment , univariate and multivariable analyses indicated that both decision aids result ed in significantly improved PCa knowledge and reduced decisional conflict compared with UC ( all P < .001 ) . At 1 month , the st and ardized mean difference ( Cohen ’s d ) in knowledge for the web group vs UC was 0.74 , and in the print group vs UC , 0.73 . Decisional conflict was significantly lower for web vs UC ( d = 0.33 ) and print vs UC ( d = 0.36 ) . At 13 months , these differences were smaller but remained significant . At 1 month , high satisfaction was reported by significantly more print ( 60.4 % ) than web participants ( 52.2 % ; P = .009 ) and significantly more web ( P = .001 ) and print ( P = .03 ) than UC participants ( 45.5 % ) . At 13 months , differences in the proportion reporting high satisfaction among print ( 55.7 % ) compared with UC ( 49.8 % ; P = .06 ) and web participants ( 50.4 % ; P = .10 ) were not significant . Screening rates at 13 months did not differ significantly among groups . CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Both decision aids improved participants ’ informed decision making about PCa screening up to 13 months later but did not affect actual screening rates . Dissemination of these decision aids may be a valuable public health tool . TRIAL REGISTRATION clinical trials.gov Identifier : NCT00196807', \"OBJECTIVE To evaluate a patient-educational approach to shared decision making for prostate cancer screening . DESIGN R and omized controlled trial with preoffice visit assessment and 2-week follow-up . SETTING University-based family practice center . PATIENTS Men aged 45 through 70 years with no history of prostate cancer or treatment for prostate disease ( N = 160 ) . Two patients were unavailable for follow-up . INTERVENTION Twenty-minute educational videotape on advantages and disadvantages of prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) screening for prostate cancer . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES A measure of patients ' core knowledge of prostate cancer developed for this study , reported preferences for PSA testing , and ratings of the videotape . RESULTS Patients '  core knowledge at baseline was poor . At 2-week follow-up , subjects undergoing videotape intervention showed a 78 % improvement in the number of knowledge questions answered correctly ( P = .001 ) , and knowledge increased about mortality due to early-stage prostate cancer , PSA screening performance , treatment-related complications , and disadvantages of screening . No overall change was observed for control subjects . At follow-up , 48 ( 62 % ) of 78 intervention patients planned to have the PSA test compared with 64 ( 80 % ) of 80 control patients ( 18.5 % absolute reduction ; 95 % confidence interval , 4.6%-32.4 % ; P = .009 ) . Intervention subjects rated favorably the amount of information provided and the clarity , balance , and length of the videotape and would recommend the videotape to others . CONCLUSIONS Patient education regarding the potential benefits and harms of early detection of prostate cancer can lead to more informed decision making . Incorporating the PSA videotape into the periodic health examination for asymptomatic men aged 50 years and older is recommended\", 'OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of a theory-based decision-making uncertainty management intervention ( DMUMI ) providing newly diagnosed prostate cancer patients with information , communication skills and personally design ed prompts . METHODS A r and omized clinical trial was conducted using a 3x2 design with intervention and control groups including both Caucasian and African-American men . General linear mixed models were used to compare intervention groups over time . RESULTS Significant main effects for the treatment groups were found for uncertainty management ( cancer knowledge , problem-solving , and patient-provider communication ) , medical communication competence , number and helpfulness of re sources for information , and decisional regret . CONCLUSION The intervention was effective in uncertainty management for Caucasian and African-American men , specifically in preparing competent patients with improved knowledge , problem-solving skills , information re sources , and communication skills . Using the Uncertainty in Illness Theory , specific skills were selected with a focus on the antecedents of uncertainty . PRACTICE IMPLICATION S In the treatment decision-making context , patients and supportive others need information about disease , treatment options and side effects but they also need communication skills training prior to the treatment decision consultation', \"OBJECTIVE To determine which of three different approaches increased women 's underst and ing of risk of pregnancy associated with different contraceptive methods . METHODS We r and omly assigned 461 reproductive-age women to one of three tables presenting pregnancy risk ( Food and Drug Administration table with numbers , World Health Organization table with numbers and categories , or table with categories ) . We evaluated participant knowledge before and after being shown the assigned table . RESULTS The most important reason for choosing a contraceptive was how well it works ( 53 % ) , followed by ease of use ( 13 % ) , and protection against sexually transmitted disease or human immunodeficiency virus ( 11 % ) . Before looking at the tables , about half the participants knew that hormone shots are more effective than pills ( 48 % ) and that pills are more effective than condoms ( 57 % ) . For these two key comparisons , the category table compared to the Food and Drug Administration table with numbers improved knowledge significantly more ( 37 % versus 20 % and 27 % versus 14 % ; both P < .05 ) . Compared with those assigned to the Food and Drug Administration table with numbers , significantly fewer participants assigned to the category table said the table was difficult to read ( 6 % versus 19 % ; P < .01 ) . Most participants in all three groups said their assigned table provided enough information to choose a contraceptive method . CONCLUSION The table with categories communicated relative contraceptive effectiveness better than the tables with numbers . However , without being presented with numbers , participants grossly overestimated the absolute risk of pregnancy using contraceptives . A combination of categories and a general range of risk for each category may provide the most accurate underst and ing of both relative and absolute pregnancy risk\", 'BACKGROUND Most women are not getting regular mammograms , and there is confusion about several mammography-related issues , including the age at which women should begin screening . Numerous groups have called for informed decision making about mammography , but few programs have result ed . Our research is intended to fill this gap . METHODS We conducted a r and omized controlled trial , which ran from 1997 to 2000 . Women aged 40 to 44 and 50 to 54 , who were enrolled in Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina , were r and omly assigned to one of three groups : usual care ( UC ) , tailored print ( TP ) material s , or TP plus tailored telephone counseling ( TP+TC ) . We assessed the impact of tailored interventions on knowledge about breast cancer and mammography , accuracy of breast cancer risk perceptions , and use of mammography at two time points after intervention-12 and 24 months . RESULTS At 12 and 24 months , women who received TP+TC had significantly greater knowledge and more accurate breast cancer risk perceptions . Compared to UC , they were 40 % more likely to have had mammograms ( odds ratio=0.9 - 2.1 ) . The effect was primarily for women in their 50s . TP had significant effects for knowledge and accuracy , but women who received TP were less likely to have had mammography . CONCLUSIONS Decision-making interventions , comprised of two tailored print interventions ( booklet and newsletter ) , delivered a year apart , with or without two tailored telephone calls , significantly increased knowledge and accuracy of perceived breast cancer risk at 12 and 24 months post-intervention . The effect on mammography use was significant in bivariate relationships but had a much more modest impact in multivariate analyses', \"After publication of this protocol a change in study design was needed.1 Due to changes in the service configuration in the host physiotherapy department individual r and omisation as originally planned could not be implemented . It was necessary to change to cluster r and omisation with the unit of r and omisation being the treating physiotherapist . Potential participants are given outpatient appointments by booking staff unaware of the physiotherapist 's r and omisation . Trial recruitment is also done blind to physiotherapist allocation . In this manner we have ensured allocation concealment prior to participants joining the study . Cluster r and omised trials need to inflate their sample size to account for clustering . Typically primary care trials use an intra-cluster correlation coefficient ( ICC ) of 0.05 in this calculation.2 Our past experience is that clustering effects by therapist in trials of this nature may be very small.3 To account for this we developed a provisional revised sample size using an ICC of 0.05 and did an interim analysis of pooled data , just for ICC of the primary outcome , after the first 40 participants had completed the three month follow-up question naire . The ICC was close to zero , suggesting that using an ICC of 0.05 was too conservative . We therefore assumed an ICC of 0.01 to estimate the design effect due to clustering . Based on an average cluster size of nine this results in a revised final sample size of 158\", \"BACKGROUND Despite evidence that shared decision-making tools for treatment decisions improve decision quality and patient engagement , they are not commonly employed in orthopaedic practice . The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of decision and communication aids on patient knowledge , efficiency of decision making , treatment choice , and patient and surgeon experience in patients with osteoarthritis of the hip or knee . METHODS One hundred and twenty-three patients who were considered medically appropriate for hip or knee replacement were r and omized to either a shared decision-making intervention or usual care . Patients in the intervention group received a digital video disc and booklet describing the natural history and treatment alternatives for hip and knee osteoarthritis and developed a structured list of questions for their surgeon in consultation with a health coach .  Patients in the control group received information about the surgeon 's practice . Both groups reported their knowledge and stage in decision making and their treatment choice , satisfaction , and communication with their surgeon . Surgeons reported the appropriateness of patient questions and their satisfaction with the visit . The primary outcome measure tracked whether patients reached an informed decision during their first visit . Statistical analyses were performed to evaluate differences between groups . RESULTS Significantly more patients in the intervention group ( 58 % ) reached an informed decision during the first visit compared with the control group ( 33 % ) ( p = 0.005 ) . The intervention group reported higher confidence in knowing what questions to ask their doctor ( p = 0.0034 ) . After the appointment , there was no significant difference between groups in the percentage of patients choosing surgery ( p = 0.48 ) . Surgeons rated the number and appropriateness of patient questions higher in the intervention group ( p < 0.0001 ) , reported higher satisfaction with the efficiency of the intervention group visits ( p < 0.0001 ) , and were more satisfied overall with the intervention group visits ( p < 0.0001 ) . CONCLUSIONS Decision and communication aids used in orthopaedic practice had benefits for both patients and surgeons . These findings could be important in facilitating adoption of shared decision-making tools into routine orthopaedic practice\", 'Objective : Shared decision making is inadequate in intensive care units . Decision aids can improve decision making quality , though their role in an intensive care units setting is unclear . We aim ed to develop and pilot test a decision aid for shared decision makers of patients undergoing prolonged mechanical ventilation . Setting : Intensive care units at three medical centers . Subjects : Fifty-three surrogate decision makers and 58 physicians . Design and Interventions : We developed the decision aid using defined method ological guidelines . After an iterative revision process , formative cognitive testing was performed among surrogate – physician dyads . Next , we compared the decision aid to usual care control in a prospect i ve , before/after design study . Measurements and Main Results : Primary outcomes were physician – surrogate discordance for expected patient survival , comprehension of relevant medical information , and the quality of communication . Compared to control , the intervention group had lower surrogate – physician discordance ( 7 [ 10 ] vs. 43 [ 21 ] ) , greater comprehension ( 11.4 [ 0.7 ] vs. 6.1 [ 3.7 ] ) , and improved quality of communication ( 8.7 [ 1.3 ] vs. 8.4 [ 1.3 ] ) ( all p < .05 ) post-intervention . Hospital costs were lower in the intervention group ( $ 110,609 vs. $ 178,618 ; p = .044 ) ; mortality did not differ by group ( 38 % vs. 50 % , p = .95 ) . Ninety-four percent of the surrogates and 100 % of the physicians reported that the decision aid was useful in decision making . Conclusion : We developed a prolonged mechanical ventilation decision aid that is feasible , acceptable , and associated with both improved decision-making quality and less re source utilization . Further evaluation using a r and omized controlled trial design is required to evaluate the decision aid ’s effect on long-term patient and surrogate outcomes', 'Study Design . Secondary analysis within a large clinical trial . Objective . To evaluate the changes in treatment preference before and after watching a video decision aid as part of an informed consent process . Summary of Background Data . A r and omized trial with a similar decision aid in herniated disc patients had shown decreased rate of surgery in the video group , but the effect of the video on expressed preferences is not known . Methods . Subjects enrolling in the Spine Patient Outcomes Research Trial ( SPORT ) with intervertebral disc herniation , spinal stenosis , or degenerative spondylolisthesis at 13 multidisciplinary spine centers across the United States were given an evidence -based videotape decision aid viewed prior to enrollment as part of informed consent . Results . Of the 2505 patients , 86 % ( n = 2151 ) watched the video and 14 % ( n = 354 ) did not . Watchers shifted their preference more often than nonwatchers ( 37.9 % vs. 20.8 % , P < 0.0001 ) and more often demonstrated a strengthened preference ( 26.2 % vs. 11.1 % , P < 0.0001 ) . Among the 806 patients whose preference shifted after watching the video , 55 % shifted toward surgery ( P = 0.003 ) . Among the 617 who started with no preference , after the video 27 % preferred nonoperative care , 22 % preferred surgery , and 51 % remained uncertain . Conclusion . After watching the evidence -based patient decision aid ( video ) used in SPORT , patients with specific lumbar spine disorders formed and /or strengthened their treatment preferences in a balanced way that did not appear biased toward or away from surgery', 'OBJECTIVE Abdominal aortic aneurysm patients tend to be informed inconsistently and incompletely about their disorder and the treatment options open to them . The objective of this trial was to evaluate whether these patients are better informed and experience less decisional conflict regarding their treatment options after viewing a decision aid . DESIGN A six-centre , r and omised clinical trial comparing a decision aid plus regular information versus regular information from the surgeon . METHODS Included patients had recently been diagnosed with an asymptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysm at least 4 cm in diameter . The decision aid consisted of a one-time viewing of an interactive CD-ROM elaborating on elective surgery versus watchful waiting . Generally , the decision aid advised patients with aneurysms less than 5.5 cm to agree to watchful waiting , for larger aneurysms the decision aid provided insight into the balance of benefit and harm of surgical and conservative approaches , taking into account age , co-morbidity and size of the aneurysm . The primary outcome was patient decisional conflict measured at 1 month follow-up ( Decisional Conflict Scale ) . Secondary outcomes were patient knowledge , anxiety and satisfaction . RESULTS In 178 aneurysm patients , decisional conflict scores did not differ significantly between the decision aid and the regular information groups ( 22 vs. 24 on the 0 - 100 Decisional Conflict Scale ; p = .33 ) . Patients in the decision aid group had significantly better knowledge ( 10.0 vs. 9.4 out of 13 points ; p = .04 ) , whereas anxiety levels ( 4.4 and 5.0 on a 0 - 21 scale ; p = .73 ) and satisfaction scores ( 74 and 73 on a 0 - 100 scale ; p = .81 ) were similar in both groups . CONCLUSION In addition to regular patient-surgeon communication , a decision aid helps to share treatment decisions with abdominal aortic aneurysm patients by increasing their knowledge about the disorder and available treatment options without raising anxiety levels ; however , it does not reduce decisional conflict , nor does it improve satisfaction', 'Background . Computerized decision aids have the potential to increase patient involvement in the decision-making process . However , most published evidence concerning the effectiveness of decision aids is from secondary care . Aim . To evaluate whether the addition of a computerized decision aid to written information improves decision making in women consulting their general practitioner with menorrhagia comparedwithwritten informationalone . Design of study . R and omized controlled trial . Setting . Nineteen general practice s in the North of Engl and . Method . One hundred forty-nine women presenting with menorrhagia were r and omized to receive written information and access to a computerized decision aid or written information alone . Outcomes were assessed using postal question naires . These were scores on the Decisional Conflict Scale and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory anxiety scale at 2 weeks and the Menorrhagia Specific Utility quality -of-life scale , knowledge about menorrhagia , and anxiety and process measures at 6 months . Results . Two weeks after the intervention , there was significantly less decisional conflict in the intervention group ( adjusted difference = −16.6 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] = −21.5 to −11.7 ; P < 0.001 ) . At 6 months , the intervention group showed better knowledge about menorrhagia ( adjusted difference = 9.3 ; 95 % CI = 1.9 to 16.6 ; P = 0.014 ) and menorrhagia quality of life ( adjusted difference = 10.9 ; 95 % CI = 0.9 to 21.0 ; P = 0.033 ) . There was no difference in anxiety scores at either 2 weeks or 6 months . Conclusions . A computerized decision aid , used outside of the primary care consultation , is effective in increasing patient involvement in decision making in primary care', 'OBJECTIVE To compare patient satisfaction with 3 different postpartum contraceptive counseling methods . STUDY DESIGN R and omized , prospect i ve trial in an urban medical center . Patients were r and omized to receive physician-patient counseling , written literature or an educational video . The main outcome variable was patient satisfaction with the contraceptive teaching method .  Patient satisfaction was analyzed as a categorical variable and compared with chi2 tests . Secondary outcomes were compared with chi2 tests and ANOVA . RESULTS Greater than 90 % of patients in each arm were satisfied with the contraceptive counseling that they received . Patients receiving physician-patient counseling  expressed a 99 % satisfaction rate ( p = 0.044 ) . African American ( 98.2 % ) and Hispanic ( 93.5 % ) patients were more satisfied than Caucasian ( 83.3 % ) patients ( p = 0.026 ) . Satisfaction with contraceptive counseling decreased with age . CONCLUSION An organized program of contraceptive counseling provides adequate information for patients to be comfortable with their decision about their postpartum contraceptive method . Patients were most satisfied with physician counseling', \"BACKGROUND There is a lack of evidence regarding the value of tools design ed to aid decision making in patients with newly diagnosed hypertension . AIM To evaluate two interventions for assisting newly diagnosed hypertensive patients in the decision whether to start drug therapy for reducing blood pressure . DESIGN OF STUDY Factorial r and omised controlled trial . SETTING Twenty-one general practice s in south-west Engl and , UK . METHOD Adults aged 32 to 80 years with newly diagnosed hypertension were r and omised to receive either : ( a ) computerised utility assessment interview with individualized risk assessment and decision analysis ; or ( b ) information video and leaflet about high blood pressure ; or ( c ) both interventions ; or ( d ) neither intervention . Outcome measures were decisional conflict , knowledge , state anxiety , intentions regarding starting treatment , and actual treatment decision . RESULTS Of 217 patients r and omised , 212 ( 98 % ) were analysed at the primary follow-up ( mean age = 59 years , 49 % female ) . Decision analysis patients had lower decisional conflict than those who did not receive this intervention ( 27.6 versus 38.9 , 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] for adjusted difference = -13.0 to -5.8 , P < 0.001 ) , greater knowledge about hypertension ( 73 % versus 67 % , adjusted 95 % CI = 2 % to 9 % , P = 0.003 ) and no evidence of increased state anxiety ( 34.8 versus 36.8 , adjusted 95 % CI = -5.6 to 0.1 , P = 0.055 ) . Video/leaflet patients had lower decisional conflict than corresponding controls ( 30.3 versus 36.8 , adjusted 95 % CI = -7.4 to -0.6 , P = 0.021 ) , greater knowledge ( 75 % versus 65 % , adjusted 95 % CI = 6 % to 13 % , P < 0.001 ) and no evidence of increased state anxiety ( 35.7 versus 36.1 , adjusted 95 % CI = -3.9 to 1.7 , P = 0.46 ) . There were no differences between either of the interventions and their respective controls in the proportion of patients prescribed antihypertensive medication ( 67 % ) . CONCLUSIONS This trial demonstrates that , among patients facing a real treatment decision , interventions to inform patients about hypertension and to clarify patients ' values concerning outcomes of treatment are effective in reducing decisional conflict and increasing patient knowledge , while not result ing in any increases in state anxiety\", 'The aim of this prospect i ve study is to assess the reliability and validity of a multi-dimensional measure of informed choice ( MMIC ) . Participants were 225 pregnant women in two general hospitals in the UK , women receiving low-risk results following serum screening for Down syndrome . The MMIC was administered before testing and the Ottawa Decisional Conflict Scale  was administered 6 weeks later . The component scales of the MMIC , knowledge and attitude , were internally consistent ( alpha values of 0.68 and 0.78 , respectively ) . Those who made a choice categorised as informed using the MMIC rated their decision 6 weeks later as being more informed , better supported and of higher quality than women whose choice was categorised as uninformed . This provides evidence of predictive validity , whilst the lack of association between the MMIC and anxiety shows construct ( discriminant ) validity . Thus , the MMIC has been shown to be psychometrically robust in pregnant women offered the choice to undergo prenatal screening for Down syndrome and receiving a low-risk result . Replication of this finding in other groups , facing other decisions , with other outcomes , should be assessed in future research', \"OBJECTIVE Assessment of the use of a computerized information-tool  in the context of a shared decision-making process with chronic pain patients . METHODS In the scope of a prospect i ve and r and omized study on shared decision-making with Fibromyalgia patients , a total of 75 patients had access to computer-based information about their illness . Fibromyalgia is a condition of chronic wide-spread pain , belonging to rheumatism , which mainly affects mature female patients . The majority of the patients in our study are female ( 93 % ) with an average age of 50 years . The computer-based information-tool provided the patients with detailed information about pathogenesis , typical symptoms , treatment options and prognosis . Six evaluative questions were posed to the participants concerning the assessment of the information presented , the h and ling of the programme , the need for an introduction to the programme , the quality of the layout and the assessment of the length of time spent in front of the computer and the assessment of the usefulness of such a tool in general practitioners ' offices . Furthermore , psychological self- assessment question naires were filled out by the participants . RESULTS The patients highly appreciate the possibility of using  computer-based information-tools  and endorse the implementation of such tools in general practitioners ' offices . CONCLUSION Computerized information leads to a better underst and ing of the illness and the treatment options on the part of the patient . PRACTICAL IMPLICATION S For further practical use it is crucial to provide an introduction to the h and ling of a computer to unskilled patients\", 'PURPOSE Decision-making on adjuvant radioactive iodine ( RAI ) treatment for early-stage papillary thyroid cancer ( PTC ) is complex because of uncertainties in medical evidence . Using a parallel , two-arm , r and omized , controlled trial design , we examined the impact of a patient-directed computerized decision aid ( DA ) on the medical knowledge and decisional conflict in patients with early-stage PTC considering the choice of being treated with adjuvant RAI or not . The DA describes the rationale , possible risks and benefits , and the medical evidence uncertainty relating to the choice . PATIENTS AND METHODS We recruited 74 patients with early-stage PTC after thyroidectomy . Participants were assigned by using 1:1 central computerized r and omization to either the DA group with usual care ( intervention ) or usual care alone ( control ) .  Medical knowledge about PTC and  RAI treatment ( the primary outcome ) , as well as decisional conflict ( a secondary outcome ) , were measured by using vali date d question naires , and the respective scores were compared between groups . RESULTS Consistent with PTC epidemiology , 83.8 % ( 62 of 74 ) of the participants were women , and the mean age was 45.8 years ( range , 19 to 79 years ) . Medical knowledge about PTC and RAI treatment was significantly greater and decisional conflict was significantly reduced in the DA group compared with the control group ( respective P values < .001 ) . The use of adjuvant RAI treatment was not significantly different between groups ( DA group , 11 of 37 [ 29.7 % ] ; controls , seven of 37 [ 18.9 % ] ; P = .278 ) . CONCLUSION A computerized DA improves informed decision making in patients with early-stage PTC who are considering adjuvant RAI treatment . DAs are useful for patients facing decisions subject to medical evidence uncertainty', \"OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effects of an information film on making an informed choice regarding Down syndrome screening , and women 's knowledge and experiences of information . METHODS R and omized controlled trial including 184 women in the intervention group and 206 controls recruited from maternity units in Stockholm , Sweden . The intervention was an information film presented as a complement to written and verbal information . Data were collected via a question naire in gestational week 27 . Three different measures were combined to measure informed choice : attitudes towards Down syndrome screening , knowledge about Down syndrome and Down syndrome screening , and uptake of CUB ( combined ultrasound and biochemical screening ) . RESULTS In the intervention group 71.5 % made an informed choice versus 62.4 % in the control group . Women in the intervention group had significantly increased knowledge , and to a greater extent than the control group , experienced the information as being sufficient , comprehensible , and correct . CONCLUSIONS An information film tended to increase the number of women who made an informed choice about Down syndrome screening . Participants were more satisfied with the information received . PRACTICE IMPLICATION S Access to correct , nondirective , and sufficient information is essential when making a choice about prenatal diagnostics . It is essential with equivalent information to all women\", 'Background In 2003 Germany started to replace its per-day hospital payment system by a prospect i ve payment system based on diagnosis related groups ( DRG ) . The primary objective of the program was to increase economic efficiency of hospital care . The introduction was accompanied by fears that quality of care could deteriorate when hospitals withhold necessary care in order to increase profits . Outpatient physicians expected an increase in their workload , which could probably lead to financial losses if it were not followed by an increase of their reimbursement . In order to detect possible adverse effects , the Statutory Health Insurance ( SHI ) was obligated by law to commission independent observational research on this question', \"Context Direct-to-consumer drug advertisements do not provide st and ardized information about the benefits and harms of drug therapies . Contribution These r and omized trials tested whether adding a drug facts box to consumer prescription advertisements improved consumer knowledge and judgment . The facts box showed numbers of outcomes , including adverse events , which might occur with 2 alternative drug therapies . Consumers given advertisements that included the box had more accurate perceptions of drug benefits and side effects than consumers given advertisements without the box . Implication A st and ardized table quantifying outcomes that might occur with different therapies improved consumer knowledge of drug benefits and side effects . The Editors Direct-to-consumer advertising surpasses all other efforts to alert the U.S. public about prescription drugs . Industry spent more than $ 5 billion on these ads in 2007 (1)more than twice the total U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) budget ( 2 ) . Although the ads are often justified as serving an educational purpose , they generally fail to provide the most fundamental information consumers need to make informed decisions : data on how well the drug works . To address this problem , we developed a drug facts box , a 1-page summary of a drug 's benefit and side effects . The central information is provided in a table that shows the chance of various outcomes for people who do and do not take the drug . In previous studies , we showed that consumers underst and and value this information ( 3 , 4 ) . We performed 2 r and omized , controlled trials in nationally representative sample s of U.S. adults ( the target audience for direct-to-consumer advertising ) to test whether a drug facts box improves consumer knowledge and helps people make better choices . Methods Design We conducted 2 r and omized , controlled trials with the same basic design from October 2006 through April 2007 : the symptom drug box trial and the prevention drug box trial . We conducted a pair of trials because consumers generally face decisions about 2 categories of drugs : those taken to treat current symptoms and those taken to reduce the risk for future events ( prevention ) . In the symptom drug box trial , we used direct-to-consumer ads for drugs to treat heartburn , an outcome ( heartburn relief ) that is common and experienced directly . We chose to include a proton-pump inhibitor ( PPI ) and a histamine-2 (H2)blocker because both drugs are used to treat current symptoms of the same disease and have similar side effect profiles , but PPIs clearly outperform H2-blockers ; we could therefore assess whether the box helped consumers choose the superior drug . In the prevention drug box trial , we used advertisements for a statin and clopidogrel for secondary cardiovascular prevention . These drugs are used to reduce the risk for future events that are important but relatively rare ( heart attack and death ) , so absolute effects can only be small . The goal of this trial was to see whether the box improved the accuracy of consumers ' perceptions about drugs used to reduce cardiovascular risk . Figure 1 shows the ads used in each trial . Figure 1 . Advertisements given to trial participants . Appendix 1 and Appendix 2 provide full-size images of all 8 ads . PPI = proton-pump inhibitor . Supplement . Appendix 1 Supplement . Appendix 2 Committees for the protection of human subjects at Dartmouth Medical School and the University of Massachusetts approved the trials . Trial protocol s were registered with Clinical Trials.gov before recruitment began . Sample Selection Figure 2 summarizes participant flow into the study . Figure 2 . Study flow diagram . R and om-Digit Dialing Protocol The Center for Survey Research , University of Massachusetts ( who conducted both surveys ) , created 2 national , r and om-digit dial sample s , each with about 3000 telephone numbers . Trained interviewers used a st and ard protocol in which they called each telephone number at least 6 times ( different days , weeks , and times ) . Whenever someone answered , the interviewer explained that we are conducting an important study about how people feel about different ways to provide information about prescription drugs in advertising . English-speaking adults age 35 to 70 years in the household were invited to participate ( if > 1 adult was eligible , the computerwhich guided these screening interviewsr and omly selected one ) . R and omization and Mail Survey Protocol Participants were r and omly assigned to the drug box or control group by using a central computerized r and om-number generator ( to ensure allocation concealment ) and were mailed survey material s ( 2 drug ads , the survey , and a stamped return envelope ) plus a prepaid $ 10 incentive with a promise of an additional $ 10 upon survey completion . Participants were not told about the alternate survey form . Nonresponders received reminder postcards after 2 weeks , a replacement question naire after 4 weeks , a telephone call after 6 weeks , and a question naire after 8 weeks . Response Rates We used st and ard Association for Public Opinion Research methods to calculate overall response rates ( 5 ) . The numerator is completed surveys ( 231 symptom drug box trial participants [ 122 in the drug box group and 109 in the control group ] and 219 prevention drug box trial participants [ 111 in the drug box group and 108 in the control group ] ) . The denominator is individuals known to be eligible ( 289 in the symptom drug box trial and 290 in the prevention drug box trial ) plus an estimate of eligible individuals in households that could not be screened . In the symptom drug box trial , this number184was calculated by applying the 44.4 % eligibility fraction observed among screened households to the 414 unscreened households . The overall response rates were 49 % in the symptom drug box trial ( 231/[289 + 184 ] ) and 46 % in the prevention drug box trial ( 219/[290 + 182 ] ) . Completion rates were calculated by using completed surveys as the numerator and participants as the denominator . For the symptom drug box trial , the completion rate was 89 % ( 231/258 ) ; the drug box group had a higher completion rate than the control group ( 95 % [ 122/129 ] vs. 84 % [ 109/129 ] ; P= 0.010 ) . In the prevention drug box trial , the completion rate was 84 % ( 219/260 ) and did not differ between groups . Study Material s We modified actual drug ads by disguising the name of the drug and manufacturer to avoid preconceived notions that participants might hold . Appendix 1 and Appendix 2 include all material s. Ad Image Page All participants received the same ad image page ( the colorful front page ) . Participants in the symptom drug box trial received ads for an H2-blocker ( Amcid ) and a PPI ( Maxtor ) . In the prevention drug box trial , the ads were for a statin ( Concor ) and clopidogrel ( Pridclo ) . Second Page In both trials , the second page differed according to r and omization . For control participants , the second page was the actual ad 's brief summary : the drug label excerpt that the FDA requires in drug ads . The drug box groups received drug facts boxes . These boxes ( Figure 3 shows the Pridclo [ clopidogrel ] box ) include a descriptive section with basic drug information ( such as indications and other things to consider doing ) . The central element is a summary table of efficacy and side effects presented as the chance of various outcomes for people who do or do not take the drug . We completed the boxes by using data from individual trials because that is how the FDA approaches drug approval ; they do not use meta- analysis to judge efficacy . Figure 3 . Pridclo ( clopidogrel ) drug facts box . FDA = U.S. Food and Drug Administration . To find efficacy data for the boxes in the symptom drug box trial , we used the Cochrane Collaboration review ( 6 ) on short-term treatment of gastroesophageal reflux diseaselike symptoms to identify all placebo-controlled trials of PPIs and H2-blockers for empirical therapy . For each drug , we chose the largest of the trials with same outcome : sustained relief , which is no heartburn episodes for 3 consecutive days . To facilitate comparisons , we st and ardized the base rate of sustained relief by averaging the findings in the placebo groups of the 2 studies ( 23 % in the H2-blocker study [ 7 ] vs. 15 % in the PPI study [ 8 ] , yielding an average base rate of 19 % ) . We calculated the relative risk ( drug vs. placebo ) for sustained relief in the H2-blocker ( relative risk , 1.87 ) and PPI ( relative risk , 4.67 ) trials by using the observed findings . To get st and ardized rates , we multiplied the averaged placebo rate by each relative risk . To frame the outcome as the proportion of patients still having heartburn , we used the complement of these calculated rates . Side effect data for the drug boxes were abstract ed from the corresponding brief summaries ( given to control participants ) to ensure that both groups had access to similar information . Although many side effects are listed throughout the brief summary , the drug box includes only the most important and largest relative to placebo or other comparator ( organized into life-threatening and symptom categories ) to focus the reader 's attention and minimize cognitive burden . To find efficacy data for the boxes in the prevention drug box trial , we began with the currently approved label for clopidogrel ( 9 ) . The label cites a single trial supporting the use of clopidogrel for heart attack prevention : CAPRIE ( Clopidogrel vs. Aspirin in Patients at Risk of Ischemic Events ) ( 10 ) . To find a similar study for the statin ( in terms of sample size , high-risk population , and outcome of heart attack ) , we review ed a meta- analysis of cholesterol-lowering treatment ( 11 ) . We chose the Medical Research Council Heart Protection Study of simvastatin ( 12 ) . To facilitate comparisons , we st and ardized the base rates of heart attack and all-cause mortality by taking the average risk in the comparator groups of the 2 studies . To get the st and ardized risk in both drug groups , we multiplied the st and ardized\", \"BACKGROUND Decision aids are tools that help patients make specific and deliberative choices among options . This study was a group r and omized controlled trial of a novel decision aid to help patients with breast cancer make adjuvant therapy ( AT ) decisions . METHODS Fourteen oncology practice s ( n=58 physicians ) were r and omized to receive the decision aid or a control pamphlet . Complete data were obtained from 405 patient-oncologist pairs . Eligible patients had stage I-III disease and had completed their primary treatment . The decision aid is a simple to use computer program , titled Adjuvant ! , that provides estimates of outcome with and without AT . Graphical representations of outcome are shared with patients . Consultations were audiotaped , patients interviewed , and physicians completed a self-administered survey . RESULTS In a multivariable model , the 54 patients ( 13.3 % ) who took no AT were more likely to have received the decision aid ( p=0.02 ) . A differential effect of the Adjuvant !  Decision Guide was noted between node negative and positive patients . It was stated by 86.2 % of patients that the decision aid was influential when making their treatment decision . Over 95 % of patients reported that the Adjuvant Decision Guide was easy to underst and and 75 % of physicians believed that it helped them underst and their patient 's treatment preferences and 81.4 % reported the information as useful for themselves . CONCLUSIONS This study showed that a decision aid made a difference in the choice of whether or not to take AT . The decision aid allowed patients and physicians to consider the benefits of AT in an easy to underst and format . Treatment decisions were more individualized for patients in the intervention than in the control group . The use of the decision aid was acceptable to both patients and physicians\", 'OBJECTIVES To design a tool for nonvalvular atrial fibrillation ( NVAF ) to inform individuals of their individual stroke and bleeding risks , assist in clarifying priorities , and promote communication . DESIGN Clustered r and omized controlled trial . SETTING Primary care clinics . PARTICIPANTS Individuals with NVAF ( N = 135 ) . INTERVENTION Completion of tool before regularly scheduled visit . MEASUREMENTS Primary outcomes included the 100-point informed and values clarity subscales of the decisional conflict scale ( lower scores indicate individual is more informed and has greater clarity ) . Secondary outcomes included knowledge , patient-clinician communication , and change in treatment . RESULTS Sixty-nine individuals were enrolled in the intervention group and 66 in the control group . After their visit , intervention participants had lower scores on the informed ( mean difference = -11.9 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) = -21.1 to -2.7 ) and values clarity subscales ( mean difference = -14.6 , 95 % CI = -22.6 to -6.6 ) . Greater proportions of intervention participants knew medications for reducing stroke risk ( 61 % vs 31 % , P < .001 ) and side effects ( 49 % vs 37 % , P = .07 ) . Stroke ( 71 % vs 12 % ) and bleeding risk ( 69 % vs 20 % ) were discussed more frequently in the intervention than control group ( P < .001 ) . Five intervention participants expressed a preference for medication that was not concordant with their current treatment plan . There was no change in treatment plan in either group . CONCLUSION The tool was effective in improving perceived and actual knowledge and values clarity and in increasing physician-patient communication but did not change treatment', 'OBJECTIVE To evaluate the level of informed decision making in a r and omized controlled trial comparing colonoscopy and CT-colonography for colorectal cancer screening . METHODS 8844 citizens aged 50 - 75 were r and omly invited to colonoscopy ( n=5924 ) or CT-colonography ( n=2920 ) screening . All invitees received an information leaflet . Screenees received a question naire within 4 weeks before the planned examination , non-screenees 4 weeks after the invitation . A decision was categorized as informed when characterized by sufficient decision-relevant knowledge and consistent with personal attitudes toward participation in screening . RESULTS Knowledge and attitude items were completed by 1032/1276 colonoscopy screenees ( 81 % ) , by 698/4648 colonoscopy non-screenees ( 15 % ) , by 824/982 CT-colonography screenees ( 84 % ) and by 192/1938 CT-colonography non-screenees ( 10 % ) . 1027 colonoscopy screenees ( > 99 % ) and 815 CT-colonography screenees ( 99 % ) had adequate knowledge ; 915 ( 89 % ) and 742 ( 90 % ) had a positive attitude . 675 non-screenees invited to colonoscopy ( 97 % ) and 182 invited to CT-colonography ( 95 % ) had adequate knowledge ; 344 ( 49 % ) and 94 ( 49 % ) expressed a negative attitude . CONCLUSION A large majority of screenees made an informed decision on participation . Almost half of responding non-screenees , made an uninformed decision , suggesting additional barriers to participation . PRACTICE IMPLICATION S Efforts to underst and the additional barriers will create opportunities to facilitate informed participation to colorectal cancer screening', 'OBJECTIVE We conducted an economic evaluation of mammography promotion interventions in a population -based , nationally representative sample of 5500 women veterans . METHODS Women 52 years and older were r and omly selected from the National Registry of Women Veterans and r and omly assigned to a survey-only control group and two intervention groups that varied in the extent of personalization ( tailored vs. targeted ) . Effectiveness measures were the prevalence of at least one self-reported post-intervention mammogram and two post-intervention mammograms 6 - 15 months apart . Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios ( ICERs ) were the incremental cost per additional person screened . Uncertainty was examined with sensitivity analysis and bootstrap simulation . RESULTS The targeted intervention cost $ 25 per person compared to $ 52 per person for the tailored intervention . About 27 % of the cost was incurred in identifying and recruiting the eligible population . The percent of women reporting at least one mammogram were .447 in the control group , .469 in the targeted group , and .460 in the tailored group . The ICER was $ 1116 comparing the targeted group to the control group ( 95 % confidence interval (CI)=$493 to dominated ) . The tailored intervention was dominated ( more costly and less effective ) by the targeted intervention . CONCLUSION Decision-makers should consider effectiveness evidence and the full recruitment and patient time costs associated with the implementation of screening interventions when making investments in mammography screening promotion programs . Identification and recruitment of eligible participants add substantial costs to outreach screening promotion interventions . Tailoring adds substantial cost to the targeted mammography promotion strategy without a commensurate increase in effectiveness . Although cost-effectiveness has been reported to be higher for some in-reach screening promotion interventions , a recent meta- analysis revealed significant heterogeneity in the effect sizes of published health-plan based intervention studies for repeat mammography ( i.e. , some studies reported null effects compared with control groups )', \"BACKGROUND Multimedia technology can be a valuable re source for health promotion and patient education initiatives because it allows messages to be presented within an environment that is both sensory-rich and interactive ( i.e. , the user can explore the information according to his or her particular needs and interests ) . Using clinic waiting time as an opportunity for breast cancer education , this investigation examined whether an educational intervention promoting breast cancer screening would be more effective when using interactive multimedia than when using written material s. METHODS Over a five-month period , 108 women ( 40 - 70 years of age ) from two clinics ( a family practice clinic and a free clinic for the poor ) participated in the study . Participants initially completed measures assessing perceptions of the personal importance of breast cancer , knowledge , and anxiety about screening procedures . They then were r and omly assigned to receive breast cancer education by using an interactive multimedia program or by reading a brochure . Following the intervention , the participants once again completed the perceived importance , knowledge , and anxiety measures , and evaluated the educational material s. RESULTS These women perceived breast cancer to be a more personally important health issue , learned more , and reported less anxiety about cancer screening following the intervention regardless of method . Younger women learned more from the educational material s than did older women . Although the multimedia program received more favorable evaluations than the brochure , this effect was mediated by the message recipient 's age , as younger women responded more favorably to the multimedia material s than did older women . CONCLUSION Preconsultation education is a valuable but rarely used opportunity to promote breast cancer screening . If well constructed , educational material s using a variety of media can be effective . While preferences for media may in part depend on the audience 's age , considerably more research is needed to better underst and how the interplay of media , message , and audience characteristics can help accomplish health-promotion objectives\", \"PURPOSE To investigate the effects of the Interactive Breast Cancer CDROM as a decision aid for breast cancer patients with a choice between breast conserving therapy ( BCT ) and mastectomy ( MT ) .  PATIENTS AND METHODS Consecutive patients with stage I and II breast cancer were enrolled . A quasi-experimental , longitudinal , and pretest/posttest design was used . Follow-up was scheduled 3 and 9 months after discharge from the hospital . Control patients ( n = 88 ) received st and ard care ( oral information and brochures ) . The CDROM was provided to patients in the experimental condition ( n = 92 ) as a supplement to st and ard procedures . Outcome variables were treatment decision , satisfaction , and quality of life ( QoL ) . RESULTS No effect on treatment decision was found . CDROM patients expressed more general satisfaction with information at 3 and 9 months ( 95 % confidence interval for the difference ( d ) between the means ( d : 4.1 to 12.5 and 5.7 to 14.2 respectively ) . CDROM patients were also more satisfied with their treatment decision at 3 and at 9 months ( d : 0.1 to 0.4 ; 0.2 to 0.5 ) . Moreover , at 9 months , CDROM patients were more satisfied with breast cancer-specific information ( d : 0.9 to 16.5 ) , the decision-making process ( d : 0.1 to 0.4 ) , and communication ( d : 0.2 to 11.0 ) . At 3 and 9 months , a positive effect was found on general health ( d : 0.2 to 14.5 and 0.3 to 15.0 ) . Moreover , at 9 months , CDROM patients reported better physical functioning ( d : 5.1 to 19.8 ) , less pain ( d : -17.9 to -4.5 ) , and fewer arm symptoms ( d : -14.1 to -0.5 ) . CONCLUSION The Interactive Breast Cancer CDROM improved decision making in patients with early-stage breast cancer with a choice between BCT and MT , as evaluated in terms of patients ' satisfaction and\", 'The study goal was to evaluate the impact of the telemedicine consult on patients with chronic wounds . Thirty patients from long-term care skilled nursing facilities , referred to the ambulatory wound care program for wound assessment and preparation of management plans , were the subject of this prospect i ve , r and omized trial . To facilitate communication with a surgical wound care specialist , telemedicine feedback was provided prior to face-to-face consultation to 15 patients . The telemedicine consult included ( 1 ) wound assessment , ( 2 ) rationale for the suggested wound management with emphasis on wound risk projections , and ( 3 ) prevention and benefits of surgical intervention . This was communicated to the patient by the field wound care nurse . The telemedicine impact was measured by assessing the duration of the subsequent face-to-face consultation and patient satisfaction with further care decisions as well as by validation of a decisional conflict scale . The average duration of the face-to-face consultation was 50 + /- 12 minutes versus 35 + /- 6 ( p < 0.01 ) minutes for patients subjected to the telemedicine feedback preceding the direct contact with the specialist . The telemedicine consult was found to be a useful aid in increasing the satisfaction rate from care decisions ultimately made during the direct consult ( acceptance rate 93 % vs. 47 % in those subjected to treatment without the intermediate telemedicine consult , p < 0.01 ) . The decisional conflict as a state of uncertainty about the course of action to take was reduced in patients subjected to telemedicine decision aid . The average Decisional Conflict Scale score was 14 + /- 1.73 in patients subjected to telemedicine feedback as opposed to 35 + /- 4.26 ( p < 0.001 ) in no-telemedicine contact . The telemedicine consult preceding face-to-face evaluation improved patient satisfaction and underst and ing of their care as well as increased the perception of shared decision making regarding the wound care', 'In this paper , we draw on the analytic perspectives of ethno methodology to explore  doctor-patient encounters in an experimental trial of a complex intervention : an efficacy r and omised controlled trial ( RCT ) of decision-support tools in the UK . We show how the experimental context in which these encounters take place pervades the interactions within them . We argue that two interactional orders were at work in the encounters that we observed : ( i ) the ceremonial order of the consultation and ( ii ) the assemblage of the decision-support tool trial . We demonstrate how doctors in the trial oscillate between positions as authoritative clinician and neutralistic decision-support tool-implementer , and patients move between positions as passive recipients of clinical knowledge and as active subjects required to render their experience as calculable in terms of the dem and s of the decision-support tools and the broader trial they are embedded in . We demonstrate how the RCT  coordinates the world of the clinical environment and the world of experimental evidence', 'Background : In the last decades , shared decision-making ( SDM ) models have been developed to increase patient involvement in treatment decisions . The purpose of this study was to evaluate a SDM intervention ( SDMI ) for patients dependent on psychoactive substances in addiction health care programs . The intervention consisted of a structured procedure to reach a treatment agreement and comprised 5 sessions . Methods : Clinicians in 3 treatment centres in the Netherl and s were r and omly assigned to the SDMI or a st and ard procedure to reach a treatment agreement . Results : A total of 220 substance-dependent patients receiving inpatient treatment were r and omised either to the intervention ( n = 111 ) or control ( n = 109 ) conditions . Reductions in primary substance use ( F(1 , 124 ) = 248.38 , p < 0.01 ) and addiction severity ( F(8 ) = 27.76 , p < 0.01 ) were found in the total population . Significant change was found in the total population regarding patients ’ quality of life measured at baseline , exit and follow-up ( F(2 , 146 ) = 5.66 , p < 0.01 ) . On the European Addiction Severity Index , SDMI  showed significantly better improvements than st and ard decision-making regarding drug use ( F(1 , 164 ) = 7.40 , p < 0.01 ) and psychiatric problems ( F(1 , 164 ) = 5.91 , p = 0.02 ) at 3-month follow-up . Conclusion : SDMI showed a significant add-on effect on top of a well-established 3-month inpatient intervention . SDMI offers an effective , structured , frequent and well-balanced intervention to carry out and evaluate a treatment agreement', \"Objective Effectively communicating information about the complex decisions that face women at midlife , including whether to use hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) , is an ongoing challenge . Although numerous decision-making tools exist , few have been evaluated . The objective of this study was to examine women 's use of a workbook design ed to promote informed HRT decision-making . Design We developed a workbook to prepare women to discuss HRT , osteoporosis , heart disease , and breast cancer with their providers . To evaluate the workbook , women aged 45–65 years were r and omly assigned to one of three groups : ( 1 ) workbook plus baseline and 6-month surveys , ( 2 ) workbook and 6-month survey , or ( 3 ) no workbook with both surveys . Results are based on the responses of 580 women in groups 1 and 2 ( response rate , 84.2 % ) . Results At 6 months , 79 % of women recalled receiving the workbook , of whom 51 % read all or most of it , 35 % skimmed or read part of it , and 14 % did not read it . The percentages of women completing self- assessment s were 55 % osteoporosis ; 56 % heart disease ; 58 % breast cancer ; 57 % advantages and disadvantages of HRT ; and 52 % personal preferences about HRT . As a result of the workbook , 10 % made an appointment with their providers , and 12 % had a discussion about HRT with their providers . Use of the workbook was not associated with menopause symptoms , attitudes about or use of HRT , hysterectomy , or provider discussion s about menopause and HRT . Conclusion This simple approach of using a mailed workbook holds promise as a successful mechanism to prepare women to discuss HRT and other related health issues with their providers\", 'This study is a 3-year follow-up of a factorial r and omised controlled trial of two decision aids - decision analysis and information video plus leaflet - for newly diagnosed hypertensive patients . We found no evidence of differences for either of the two decision aids compared with controls for the primary outcome of blood pressure control at follow-up . There were also no differences in any of the secondary outcomes measured - the proportion taking blood pressure lowering drugs , self-reported medication adherence , or consulting behaviour . The r and omised controlled trial cohort as a whole , irrespective of r and omised group , demonstrated substantial reductions in blood pressure and 10-year cardiovascular risk over the follow-up period', 'PURPOSE We wanted to determine the effect of promoting the effective communication of absolute cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) risk and shared decision making through disseminating a simple decision aid for use in family practice consultations . METHODS The study was based on a pragmatic , cluster r and omized controlled trial ( phase III ) with  continuing medical education ( CME ) groups of family physicians  as the unit of r and omization . In the intervention arm , 44 physicians ( 7 CME groups ) consecutively recruited 550 patients in whom cholesterol levels were measured . Forty-seven physicians in the control arm ( 7 CME groups ) similarly included 582 patients . Four hundred sixty patients ( 83.6 % ) of the intervention arm and 466 patients ( 80.1 % ) of the control arm were seen at follow-up . Physicians attended 2 interactive CME sessions and received a booklet , a paper-based risk calculator , and individual summary sheets for each patient . Control physicians attended 1 CME-session on an alternative topic . Main outcome measures were patient satisfaction and participation after the index consultation , change in CVD risk status , and decisional regret at 6 months ’ follow-up . RESULTS Intervention patients were significantly more satisfied with process and result ( Patient Participation Scale , difference 0.80 , P<.001 ) . Decisional regret was significantly lower at follow-up ( difference 3.39 , P = .02 ) . CVD risk decreased in both groups without a significant difference between study arms . CONCLUSION A simple transactional decision aid based on calculating absolute individual CVD risk and promoting shared decision making in CVD prevention can be disseminated through CME groups and may lead to higher patient satisfaction and involvement and less decisional regret , without negatively affecting global CVD risk', \"BACKGROUND We assessed the short-term impact of decision-making interventions on knowledge about mammography , accuracy of women 's breast cancer risk perceptions , attitudes toward mammography , satisfaction with decisions , and mammography use since the intervention . METHODS The study was conducted among women who were members of Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina and were in their 40s or 50s at the time the study began in 1997 . Women were r and omly assigned to usual care ( UC ) , tailored print booklets ( TP ) alone , or TP plus telephone counseling ( TP+TC ) . RESULTS 12-month interviews were completed by 1127 women to assess short-term intervention effects . Generally , women who received TP+TC were significantly more knowledgeable about mammography and breast cancer risk and were more accurate in their breast cancer risk perceptions than women in the TP and UC groups . They also were more likely to have had a mammogram since the baseline interview . In multivariable analyses , we found significant benefits of the combination of TP+TC compared to TP and to UC for knowledge , accuracy of risk perceptions , and mammography use . DISCUSSION For complex decision-making tasks , such as women 's decisions about mammography in the face of controversy , the combination of TP and TC may be more effective than TP alone , and certainly more effective than UC . It is critical that investigators determine the topics for which TP is appropriate and the situations that require additional supportive interventions\", 'OBJECTIVES We conducted pilot studies of the feasibility and efficacy of an interactive , computerized educational tool , Banking on Fatherhood ( BOF ) . METHODS Two small r and omized trials were conducted , with 20 male cancer patients eligible to bank sperm in Study 1 and 19 oncology fellows or residents in Study 2 . In each trial , half of the subjects viewed BOF before completing question naires , and half viewed it afterward . Outcome measures included a knowledge test in both trials and a Decisional Conflict scale in the patient trial . All participants , plus a panel of 10 experts , ultimately viewed BOF and completed a form evaluating its usability and value . RESULTS Patients who completed question naires after viewing BOF had significantly less decisional conflict about banking sperm than those who had not viewed it ( P=0.0065 ) , but knowledge scores were not significantly different between groups . Physicians who filled out question naires after viewing BOF scored significantly higher on the knowledge test ( P<0.006 ) . Patients , physicians and experts rated BOF as easy to use , informative and addressing important psychosocial concerns , with videos and animations adding to the value of the educational tool . CONCLUSION Pilot studies suggest that BOF is a feasible intervention that could enhance decisions about sperm banking . Research with larger groups is needed to vali date its effectiveness', 'OBJECTIVES To identify the decision-making factors and personal characteristics of women who opt for and against amniocentesis following a screen-positive maternal serum screen ( MSS ) result . METHODS A question naire was mailed to 597 women who were r and omly selected among women in the province of British Columbia ( BC ) who screened positive for Down syndrome ( DS ) on the MSS between January and June 2005 . Subjects were evenly distributed across two main parameters : screen-positive women who opted for , and declined , amniocentesis  ( Groups 1 and 2 , respectively ) . RESULTS Significant differences ( P < 0.05 ) between Groups 1 and 2 include ; reasons for wanting the MSS , post-positive MSS anxiety level , risk of miscarriage associated with amniocentesis , MSS risk estimate , reasons for wanting , or not wanting amniocentesis , normal fetal ultrasound , attitudes towards termination and religious beliefs . About half of all women across both groups did not find the MSS helpful in their pregnancy , primarily stating that it caused unnecessary increased anxiety . CONCLUSIONS To help avoid , or at least prepare women for the likelihood of increased anxiety following a screen-positive MSS result , and help prepare them for decision making , it is important to target MSS counselling to the individuality of the patient , and address these factors before MSS is undertaken', 'OBJECTIVE To examine who reported using unsolicited prostate cancer screening decision aids distributed as part of a r and omized controlled trial , whether reported use varied by type of aid ( video or pamphlet ) , and what affect reported use had on study outcomes . METHODS A total of 1,152 men aged 50 and older from four medical facilities in the United States were r and omly assigned to pamphlet , video or usual care ( control ) . Material s were mailed 2 weeks prior to clinic appointments in general internal medicine . Outcomes were assessed by phone survey 1 week after appointments . Analyses examined the reported use of material s by study group , the association between patient characteristics and reported use , and the impact of reported use ( adjusting for patient characteristics ) on a 10-item knowledge index . RESULTS Fifty-six percent of those r and omized to receive the video and 50 % of those r and omized to receive the pamphlet reported using the material s. Reported use of the video  was higher for patients who had greater than a high school education ( OR 1.73 ) , were married ( OR 2.20 ) , and reported no prior abnormal prostate cancer screening test results ( OR 3.39 ) . Reported use of the  pamphlet  did not vary by patient characteristics . In intent-to-treat analyses ( ignoring reported use ) , individuals r and omized to the video and pamphlet groups had significantly higher knowledge scores relative to the control group ( 7.44 , 7.26 and 6.90 respectively ) . Adjusting for reported use modestly increased the estimated differences across treatment groups but did not substantially change conclusions about the relative effects of these aids on knowledge . CONCLUSIONS Only half of men receiving unsolicited prostate cancer screening decision aids before a visit reported using the aids , and who reported using them varied by type of aid . Efforts to broadly implement decision aids may need to offer a variety of approaches , and incorporate creative strategies to enhance reaching all population subgroups', \"OBJECTIVE To describe a theoretical framework for assessing knowledge about the possible outcomes of participating in bowel cancer screening for the faecal occult blood test . METHODS The content of the knowledge measure was based on the UK General Medical Council 's screening guidelines and a theory-based approach to assessing gist knowledge ( Fuzzy Trace Theory ) . It comprised conceptual and numeric questions to assess knowledge of the underlying construct ( e.g. false positive concept ) and the approximate numbers affected ( e.g. likelihood of a false positive ) . The measure was used in a r and omised controlled trial involving 530 adults with low education , to compare the impact of a bowel screening decision aid with a screening information booklet developed for the Australian Government National Bowel Cancer Screening Program . RESULTS The numeric knowledge scale was particularly responsive to the effects of the decision aid ; at follow-up decision aid participants ' numeric knowledge was significantly greater than the controls ( P<0.001 ) . This contrasts with the conceptual knowledge scale which improved significantly in both groups from baseline to follow-up ( P<0.001 ) . CONCLUSION Our theory-based knowledge measure was responsive to change in conceptual knowledge and to the effect on numeric knowledge of a decision aid . PRACTICE IMPLICATION S This theoretical framework has the potential to guide the development of knowledge measures in other screening setting\", \"OBJECTIVE To examine the effects of using positive or negative frames to describe influenza vaccine benefits and side effects on patients ' expectations , decisions , decisional conflict , and reported side effects . METHODS 292 previously unimmunized patients with chronic respiratory or cardiac disease were r and omly assigned to receive benefit/risk information that was framed : ( 1 ) positively as the percentage who remain free of influenza and have no vaccine side effects , or ( 2 ) negatively as the percentage who acquire influenza and have vaccine side effects . Question naires elicited expectations , decisions , and decisional conflict . Vaccines were telephoned 3 days later for a self-report of local and systemic side effects and work absenteeism . RESULTS Both groups had similar immunization rates and decisional conflict scores . The positive frame group had lower and more realistic expectations of vaccine side effects , fewer systemic side effects , and less work absenteeism ( p < 0.05 ) . CONCLUSION In contrast to previous studies of health care workers , framing did not influence patients ' decisions , possibly due to the patients ' awareness of their higher risk of influenza complications and greater desire to follow recommendations . The common practice of using negative frames when describing probabilities of side effects may need to be reexamined , considering its deleterious influence on self-reported side effects and work absenteeism\", 'BACKGROUND Because of the many uncertainties surrounding screening for prostate cancer , authorities recommend that patients be involved in the screening decision . OBJECTIVE To determine the impact of informed consent on patient interest in undergoing  prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) screening . METHODS Men 50 years or older with no prior PSA testing and no history of prostate cancer presenting to 1 of 4 university-affiliated primary care practice s were eligible for enrollment . Patients were r and omized to receive either a scripted informational intervention simulating an informed consent presentation ( intervention group , n = 103 ) or a single sentence about the PSA ( control group , n = 102 ) . The main outcome measure was patient interest in undergoing PSA screening measured on a 5-point Likert scale . RESULTS Patients who received the informational intervention were significantly less interested in undergoing PSA screening than controls ( mean difference in interest , 0.8 on 5-point scale , P < .001 ) . Informed patients were much less likely to indicate high interest in screening ( odds ratio , 0.34 ; 95 % confidence interval , 0.19 - 0.60 ; P < .001 ) . In a multivariate model , family history of prostate cancer was associated with increased interest and advancing age with decreased interest in PSA screening , but the informational intervention remained the strongest predictor of interest . CONCLUSIONS Among primary care patients of predominantly lower socioeconomic status , those who received informed consent were significantly less interested in PSA screening than those who did not . For physicians who offer the PSA as a screening test , this finding highlights the importance of apprising patients of the associated benefits , burdens , and uncertainties and allowing them to participate in the screening decision', \"A r and omized study was conducted to compare a generic and individualized approach to providing decisional support to men newly diagnosed with localized prostate cancer . Patients ( N = 324 ) were referred by community urologists to a patient education center where they were r and omly assigned to receive either an individualized or generic information intervention . Men assigned to the generic group viewed a video on the various treatments available for localized prostate cancer . Men in the individualized information group used a computer program to identify their information preferences . Computer printouts on top information preferences were individualized according to patient 's specific disease characteristics , followed by a discussion of the pros and cons of each recommended treatment option . Both groups received a st and ardized package of written information . Men completed measures of decision control , satisfaction , and decision conflict at baseline and after a definitive treatment decision was made . Results demonstrated that overall both groups reported increased levels of decision control and lower levels of decision conflict after their treatment decision . All men reported being satisfied with their preparation to make a treatment decision . Compared to the generic information group , men who received the individualized information were more satisfied with the type , amount and method of providing information , and role played in treatment decision making with their physician ( P < .002 ) . Both information interventions seem to be similar in providing decisional support to this group of men at the time of diagnosis . Further research is required to determine how to identify men who may benefit from a more individualized approach\", \"Context Many patients who might benefit from colorectal cancer screening do not get screening . Time pressure may prevent physicians from fully educating their patients about colorectal cancer screening . Contribution In this r and omized , controlled trial , an educational video about colorectal cancer screening mailed to patients before a primary care visit did not increase the rate of screening compared with usual care . Caution s The video focused on sigmoidoscopy rather than colonoscopy , and the study sample had a higher than average baseline rate of colorectal cancer screening . Colorectal cancer is a major cause of cancer death ( 1 ) . Evidence about screening test effectiveness ( 2 ) continues to mount , and guidelines from many organizations promote several screening options ( 3 - 7 ) . Rates of screening , however , remain lower than rates of other preventive services ( 8 - 10 ) . Barriers to screening are numerous . Physicians report inadequate time to educate patients and facilitate decision making ( 11 , 12 ) . Contributing factors include competing dem and s placed on clinicians ( 13 ) and the need to manage acute problems ( 12 , 14 ) . Prominent patient barriers include lack of knowledge about colorectal cancer and fears of cancer and screening tests ( 15 , 16 ) . Interventions to increase screening have generally focused on individual providers and clinical systems . Provider education programs , use of support staff , on-site sigmoidoscopy services , and reminder systems have all increased testing ( 11 , 16 - 23 ) . Patient-focused interventions have used education , reminders , and cost reduction to increase use of fecal occult blood testing ( 17 - 19 ) and sigmoidoscopy ( 20 , 21 ) . This study examined the effectiveness of an educational video design ed to increase  colorectal cancer screening , particularly via sigmoidoscopy ; the video was mailed to patients ' homes before a scheduled periodic health examination . We studied the effectiveness of this patient education video for several reasons . First , the information that patients need for colorectal cancer screening is complex and voluminous because of the multiple screening options and the increased emphasis on informed decision making and informed consent ( 22 - 26 ) . Clinicians view time dem and s and competing medical needs as screening barriers ( 27 - 29 ) . The video contains considerable information , and thus clinicians can spend less time explaining the information to patients . Second , video assures st and ardized content that is not subject to providers ' individual opinions or weak communication skills . Video overcomes some weaknesses of mass media health messages : brevity , superficial rendering of complex issues , and lack of opportunity for review ( 30 ) . Third , the public is more oriented toward viewing than reading , and video is particularly attractive to population s with low literacy ( 31 , 32 ) . Last , to our knowledge no other study has evaluated the effect of a mailed video ( an aspect that solves in-clinic logistic problems ) independent of other systems changes ( 21 ) . Methods Study Overview We used a r and omized , controlled design to assess the effectiveness of a video intended to encourage discussion of colorectal cancer screening with the primary care provider and increase use of screening , particularly by sigmoidoscopy . St and ardized telephone interviews were conducted twice . Participants completed the baseline interview several weeks before their scheduled visit and were then r and omly assigned within age and sex strata to the experimental or the control group . Follow-up assessment was completed 4 to 6 months after the periodic examination . Study Sites Participants were recruited from 5 sites in central Massachusetts . Most were patients in internal medicine and family medicine clinics of an academic medical center ( university practice ) . Other sites were a suburban clinic of a staff-model health maintenance organization ( HMO ) ; 3 university-affiliated , community-based practice s ; a rural practice ; and 2 suburban practice s , which were combined for analyses because of small sample sizes and similar patient population s ( community practice s ) . The Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects of the University of Massachusetts Medical School and the Institutional Review Board of Fallon Community Health Plan review ed and approved the study . Participant Recruitment Eligible participants were patients 50 to 74 years of age who had an upcoming periodic health assessment and were eligible for sigmoidoscopy according to screening guidelines ( no sigmoidoscopy within 5 years or colonoscopy within 10 years ) . A computerized appointment system identified potentially eligible participants because appointments are coded by type , including appointments for physical examinations , and by appointment length ( 30 minutes ) . Records used to determine previous tests varied by site and included patient information systems , medical records , and a log of completed procedures . To assure sex and age representation ( men age 50 to 64 years , men age 65 to 74 years , women age 50 to 64 years , and women age 65 to 74 years ) , we determined that a sample size of 225 in each of the younger agesex groups and a sample size of 100 in each of the older agesex groups would assure 80 % power to detect significant differences ( at an level of 0.05 ) ranging from 7 % to 16 % depending on the outcome in the comparison group overall . Patients were enrolled from February 1999 through December 2000 . We sent 1883 eligible patients an invitation letter several weeks before their appointment . Of the 1788 who were contacted by telephone , 1575 ( 88 % ) consented to participate . Consenting persons were screened for additional eligibility criteria . Those excluded reported recent ( n= 339 ) or planned ( n= 26 ) tests ; did not undergo scheduled sigmoidoscopy in the past 10 months ( n= 3 ) ; reported a colorectal cancer diagnosis or related symptoms ( n= 30 ) ; canceled their periodic examination appointment ( n= 41 ) ; could not participate because of illness , death , disability , or dementia or because they were institutionalized ( n= 69 ) ; did not speak English ( n= 35 ) ; had a spouse enrolled in the study ( n= 17 ) ; had moved out of the area ( n= 12 ) ; or were older than 74 years of age ( n= 2 ) . The baseline sample consisted of 1001 persons . After the baseline interview was completed , we sorted consenting participants into the 4 sexage groups . A computer-generated r and om-number table determined assignment in each group . The project director , who was not located at any clinical site , allocated enrollees to the intervention or control group using the computer-generated assignment , tracked group assignment , and mailed intervention material s. The project director was the only individual with knowledge of or access to group or individual assignment . The interviewer was blinded to group assignment at both baseline ( conducted before r and omization ) and follow-up interviews . Subsequently , 63 patients were not eligible : 50 did not keep an index appointment , and 13 could not participate because of death , poor health , or decline in cognitive inability . Of the 938 persons eligible for follow-up ( 97.9 % ) , 926 were contacted by an interviewer who was blinded to group assignment , and 918 completed the follow-up interview . Intervention The objective of the video was to encourage patients to discuss colorectal cancer screening , particularly using sigmoidoscopy , with their physician at their upcoming appointment . This intervention builds on the promising literature about the effectiveness of video to improve health behavior ( 30 , 33 - 35 ) , increase patient knowledge ( 36 - 40 ) , reduce anxiety ( 41 , 42 ) , and provide role modeling ( 43 ) . The intervention consisted of a 15-minute video titled Say Yes to the Test . Development was guided by the PRECEDE/PROCEED model for health promotion planning ( 44 ) and the behavioral model of utilization ( 45 ) , incorporating elements of social cognitive theory ( 46 , 47 ) . We were also interested in testing a mailed outreach strategy . Showing videos in busy clinics is logistically difficult , presenting time , equipment , noise , space , and privacy problems . Friedman and colleagues ( 48 ) found that episodic technical difficulties hindered video education in the clinic setting . Mead and colleagues ( 49 ) reported that patient education material s ( video , pamphlets , posters ) placed in clinic waiting rooms did not increase use of preventive services . Of note , widespread ownership of video players and affordable per-unit cost make a mail-out approach feasible . The video , hosted by a nationally known actress who has had colorectal cancer , described screening by using graphics , footage of physicians discussing screening importance , and footage of a patient undergoing sigmoidoscopy .  It addressed benefits and barriers to sigmoidoscopy , primarily with clips of several patients who had screening-detected colorectal cancer , and featured patients discussing sigmoidoscopy experiences ( 50 ) . Barriers included minimal knowledge of colorectal cancer , lack of screening information , low perceived risk , fear of cancer , and expectation of pain and embarrassment ( 16 , 20 , 51 - 60 ) . Videos were mailed to each participant 's home before the scheduled physical examination ; each package contained a letter , signed by the primary care physician , encouraging the participant to view the video . Participants in the control group received usual care with no special material s. Data Collection and Measures Fifteen- to 20-minute telephone surveys were conducted at baseline and 4 to 6 months after the primary care appointment . The timing of the follow-up survey allowed all recommended tests to be scheduled and completed . We developed survey items by using our previous work ( 50 , 61 ) and other studies ( 62 ) . The survey described all tests : For example , a fecal occult blood test was defined as a test taken at home , with cards mailed back . The follow-up survey also covered the intervention group 's experience with the video . Colorectal Cancer Screening\", 'Introduction : After first-line treatment , cancer antigen 125 ( CA-125 ) levels can rise many months before there are other signs of recurrent ovarian cancer , leading to a difficult choice about when to initiate second-line treatment . To assist with shared decision making , a decision aid ( DA ) booklet that compared the options of \" wait and see , \" chemotherapy , and tamoxifen was developed and piloted . Methods : Twenty patients attending clinics at 2 cancer centers agreed to read the DA booklet , complete a set of st and ardized and purpose - design ed measures , and provide feedback on the DA booklet via a semistructured telephone interview .  Participants were either currently making the decision about treatment ( n = 14 ) or had progressed and were now receiving treatment of recurrent cancer ( n = 6 ) . Results : Most patients found information in the DA easy to underst and ( 79 % ) and presented in a balanced way ( 90 % ) , and almost all ( 95 % ) would recommend the booklet to others facing a similar decision . Women showed a good underst and ing of information contained in the booklet , with a mean of 88 % answering each of the knowledge questions correctly . Compared with other ovarian cancer studies , decisional conflict scores were lower , whereas anxiety scores were high but similar to 1 comparable study . Suggestions for improvement related to information about recurrent ovarian cancer and the decision making worksheets . Conclusions : The DA seems an acceptable and useful decision making re source in this setting . Strategies for reducing anxiety levels linked to booklet administration are outlined . The DA has been revised to reflect pilot findings and changes in clinical evidence , and the effectiveness of the DA in reducing decisional conflict and regret is being evaluated in a r and omized controlled trial', 'The antenatal clinics in the catchment area of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology , University Hospital , Lund , were divided into a study group and a control group . At the study antenatal clinics during a 15-month period 1,004 pregnant women received a written and verbal information that a routine ultrasound examination during gestational week 18 should be considered as a prenatal diagnostic method . They even got information on alternatives : to decline all , to have an early abdominal ultrasound examination , or to have both a routine ultrasound examination and an amniocentesis performed . At the control antenatal clinics , 1,408 pregnant women received st and ard information . No women in either group chose not to have an ultrasound examination performed , but 1 % chose an early abdominal examination in the study group . The percentage of women older than 35 years who asked for an amniocentesis  was equal in the two groups . However , women younger than 35 years in the study group requested amniocentesis  significantly more frequently than the women in the control group', 'OBJECTIVE : To assess the effect of providing structured information about the benefits and harms of mammography in differing frames on women ’s perceptions of screening . DESIGN : R and omized control trial . SETTING : General internal medicine academic practice . PARTICIPANTS : One hundred seventy-nine women aged 35 through 49.INTERVENTION : Women received 1 of 3 5-minute videos about the benefits and harms of screening mammography in women aged 40 to 49 . These videos differed only in the way the probabilities of potential outcomes were framed ( positive , neutral , or negative ) . MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS : We measured the change in accurate responses to questions about potential benefits and harms of mammography , and the change in the proportion of participants who perceived that the benefits of mammography were more important than the harms . Before seeing the videos , women ’s knowledge about the benefits and harms of mammography was inaccurate ( 82 % responded incorrectly to all 3 knowledge questions ) . After seeing the videos , the proportion that answered correctly increased by 52 % , 43 % , and 30 % for the 3 knowledge questions , respectively , but there were no differences between video frames . At baseline , most women thought the benefits of mammography outweighed the harms ( 79 % positive frame , 80 % neutral frame , and 85 % negative frame ) . After the videos , these proportions were similar among the 3 groups ( 84 % , 81 % , 83 % , P=.93 ) . CONCLUSIONS : Women improved the accuracy of their responses to questions about the benefits and harms of mammography after seeing the videos , but this change was not affected by the framing of information . Women strongly perceived that the benefits of mammography outweighed the harms , and providing accurate information had no effect on these perceptions , regardless of how it was framed', 'ABSTRACT PURPOSE To compare two techniques for eliciting and clarifying patient values for decision making about colorectal cancer ( CRC ) screening :  choice-based conjoint analysis and a rating and ranking task . METHODS Using our decision lab registry and university e-mail lists , we recruited average risk adults ages 48–75 for a written , mailed survey . Eligible participants were given basic information about CRC screening and six attributes of CRC screening tests , then r and omized to complete either a choice-based conjoint analysis with 16 discrete choice tasks or a rating and ranking task . The main outcome was the most important attribute , as determined from conjoint analysis or participant ranking . Conjoint analysis -based most important attribute was determined from individual patient-level utilities generated using multinomial logistic regression and hierarchical Bayesian modeling . RESULTS Of the 114 eligible participants , 104 completed and returned question naires . Mean age was 57 ( range 48–73 ) , 70 % were female , 88 % were white , 71 % were college graduates , and 62 % were up to date with CRC screening .  Ability to reduce CRC incidence and mortality was the most frequent most important attribute for both the conjoint analysis ( 56 % of respondents ) and rating/ranking ( 76 % of respondents ) groups , and these proportions differed significantly between groups ( absolute difference 20 % , 95 % CI 3 % , 37 % , p = 0.03 ) . There were no significant differences between groups in proportion with clear values ( p = 0.352 ) , intent to be screened ( p = 0.226 ) or unlabelled test preference ( p = 0.521 ) CONCLUSIONS Choice-based conjoint analysis produced somewhat different patterns of attribute importance than a rating and ranking task , but had little effect on other outcomes', 'BACKGROUND Black individuals eligible for an implantable cardioverter/defibrillator ( ICD ) are considerably less likely than white individuals to receive one . This disparity may , in part , be explained by racial differences in patient preferences . We hypothesized that a targeted patient-centered educational video could improve knowledge of sudden cardiac arrest ( SCA ) and ICDs and reduce racial differences in ICD preferences . We conducted a pilot study to assess the feasibility of testing this hypothesis in a r and omized trial . METHODS We created a video that included animation , physician commentary , and patient testimonials on SCA and ICDs . The primary outcome was the decision to have an ICD implanted as a function of race and intervention . Between January 1 , 2011 , and December 31 , 2011 , 59 patients ( 37 white and 22 black ) were r and omized to the video or health care provider counseling/usual care . RESULTS Relative to white patients , black patients were younger ( median age , 55 vs 68 years ) and more likely to have attended college or technical school . Baseline SCA and ICD knowledge was similar and improved significantly in both racial groups after the intervention . Black patients viewing the video were as likely as white patients to want an ICD ( 60.0 % vs 79.2 % , P = .20 ) ; and among those in the usual care arm , black patients were less likely than white patients to want an ICD ( 42.9 % vs 84.6 % P = .05 ) . CONCLUSION Among individuals eligible for an ICD , a video decision aid increased patient knowledge and reduced racial differences in patient preference for an ICD', 'AIMS To compare the effect of our newly developed online evidence -based patient information vs. st and ard patient information about sub-threshold elevated blood glucose levels and primary prevention of diabetes on informed patient decision making . METHODS We invited visitors to the cooperating health insurance company , Techniker Krankenkasse , and the German Diabetes Center websites to take part in a web-based r and omized controlled trial . The population after r and omization comprised 1120 individuals aged between 40 and 70 years without known diabetes , of whom 558 individuals were r and omly assigned to the intervention group receiving evidence -based patient information , and 562 individuals were r and omly assigned to the control group receiving st and ard information from the Internet . The primary endpoint was acquired knowledge of elevated blood glucose level issues and the secondary outcomes were attitude to metabolic testing , intention to undergo metabolic testing , decisional conflict and satisfaction with the information . RESULTS Overall , knowledge of elevated glucose level issues and the intention to undergo metabolic testing were high in both groups . Participants who had received evidence -based patient information , however , had significantly higher knowledge scores . The secondary outcomes in the evidence -based patient information subgroup that completed the 2-week follow-up period yielded significantly lower intention to undergo metabolic testing , significantly more critical attitude towards metabolic testing and significantly higher decisional conflict than the control subgroup ( n=466 ) . Satisfaction with the information was not significantly different between both groups . CONCLUSIONS Evidence -based patient information significantly increased knowledge about elevated glucose levels , but also increased decisional conflict and critical attitude to screening and treatment options . The intention to undergo metabolic screening decreased . Future studies are warranted to assess uptake of metabolic testing and satisfaction with this decision in a broader population of patients with unknown diabetes', \"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE To evaluate the effects of an evidence -based patient decision aid ( DA ) on  multiple sclerosis ( MS ) immunotherapy . METHODS Two hundred and ninety-seven MS patients who were considering or reconsidering immunotherapy participated in a r and omized community-based controlled trial in Germany . An intervention group ( IG ) received the DA and a control group ( CG ) received st and ard information . Primary outcome measure was the match between the patient 's preferred and actual roles during consultation with the physician . Secondary end-point was treatment choice . The course of the decision-making process and patients ; evaluation of the decision were also evaluated . Data were collected at baseline , after receiving the information , after consultation with the physician and 6 months after baseline . RESULTS The percentage of preference matches did not differ between groups ( IG 49 % , CG 51 % , P = 0.71 ) . There were no differences in immunotherapy choices between groups . IG patients temporarily became more critical of immunotherapy and rated the information as significantly more helpful . CONCLUSIONS Although the intervention led to intensified processing of the information it affected neither the roles adopted in physician-patient encounters nor the immunotherapy choices made . Providing patients with balanced information may not be sufficient to alter the decision-making process\", 'Background : Decision aids provide balanced information about the benefits and risks of treatment options and improve the match between patient preferences and the treatment received . Objective : To assess the impact of a decision aid regarding the treatment options for patients with localized prostate cancer . Methods : A 2-arm r and omized controlled trial was used to compare booklet patient decision aid ( intervention group n = 61 ) with st and ard information for localized prostate cancer ( control group  n = 61 ) . The study was conducted at 3 hospitals between 2011 and 2013 . The main outcome measures were knowledge , decisional conflict , satisfaction with the decision-making process , and coping . Results : The respective mean Decisional Conflict Scale scores before and after the intervention were 53.0 ± 16.9 and 31.2 ± 10.2 in the intervention group and 49.1 ± 13.7 and 51.7 ± 13.3 in the control group ( P < .001 ) . Mean Knowledge scores were 38.6 ± 16.5 and 75.7 ± 19.0 in the intervention group and 42.0 ± 17.6 and 49.9 ± 16.0 in the control group ( P < .001 ) . Mean Satisfaction With Decision Scale scores were 81.1 ± 8.92 and 95.7 ± 6.89 in the intervention group and 82.5 ± 12.0 and 79.3 ± 10.3 in the control group ( P < .001 ) . Conclusions : Decision aid not only improved patient knowledge about localized prostate cancer and its treatment and their satisfaction with decision making but also decreased their decisional conflict . Implication s for Practice : Decision aid represents a rather innovative approach for a health insurance fund to develop and offer this format of information and decision support . This opens a new field of study for nurses to empower patients in the decision-making process and develop new roles in this area', 'Background : An interactive digital education aid for breast reconstruction patients was developed because of a perceived need to provide patients with more education regarding the treatment so that they can make better informed treatment decisions . A prospect i ve r and omized study was conducted to assess its effectiveness . Methods : Breast cancer patients who were c and i date s for breast reconstruction were recruited and r and omized into a control group and a study group . Both groups received routine assessment and education in the plastic surgery clinic , but the study group also watched the interactive digital education aid .  Question naires assessing knowledge , anxiety , and satisfaction were administered ( 1 ) before the initial plastic surgery consultation , ( 2 ) immediately before surgery , and ( 3 ) 1 month after surgery . Results : A total of 133 women participated , 66 in the control group and 67 in the study group . Women in both groups showed decreased anxiety , increased knowledge , and enhanced satisfaction with their decision-making ability associated with preoperative instructions about reconstructive surgery . However , the study group was significantly more satisfied than the control group with the method of receiving information and showed a less steep learning curve regarding the different techniques of breast reconstruction . They also tended to have a reduced mean level of anxiety and increased satisfaction with the treatment choice compared with the control group . Conclusions : An interactive digital education aid is a beneficial educational adjunct for patients contemplating breast reconstruction . Patients who use an interactive digital education aid demonstrate greater factual knowledge , reduced anxiety , and increased postoperative satisfaction compared with patients given preoperative instructions using st and ard methods alone . The benefit of an interactive digital education aid is expected to be higher in a broad-based practice setting outside of a comprehensive cancer center', \"Our aim was to study the impact of information on the behaviour of patients who were to have an oral biopsy specimen taken . Patients were r and omly assigned either to be given the basic information about oral biopsy or a more extensive amount of information . The Krantz Health Opinion Survey was used as a measure of preferences in decisions made about oral biopsy , and we used a question naire to assess anxiety .  A total of 260 patients were studied . The participants were satisfied with the information provided ( both form and content ) , but significantly more of those given basic information would have liked to know more ( p=0.02 ) . We conclude that information exerts a clear effect on patients ' attitude to oral biopsy . Provision of preoperative information leads to significantly less anxiety in all patients having a procedure under local anaesthesia . The results emphasise that patients need to be adequately informed about oral biopsy\", 'Background . Experts have called for the inclusion of values clarification ( VC ) exercises in decision aids ( DAs ) as a means of improving their effectiveness , but little research has examined the effects of such exercises . Objective . To determine whether adding a VC exercise to a DA on heart disease prevention improves decision-making outcomes . Design . R and omized trial . Setting . UNC Decision Support Laboratory . Patients . Adults ages 40 to 80 with no history of cardiovascular disease . Intervention . A Web-based heart disease prevention DA with or without a VC exercise . Measurements . Pre- and postintervention decisional conflict and intent to reduce coronary heart disease ( CHD ) risk and postintervention self-efficacy and perceived values concordance . Results . The authors enrolled 137 participants ( 62 in DA ; 75 in DA + VC with moderate decisional conflict ( DA 2.4 ; DA + VC 2.5 ) and no baseline differences among groups . After the interventions , they found no clinical ly or statistically significant differences between groups in decisional conflict ( DA 1.8 ; DA + VC 1.9 ; absolute difference VC — DA 0.1 , 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] : —0.1 to 0.3 ) , intent to reduce CHD risk ( DA 98 % ; DA + VC 100 % ; absolute difference VC — DA : 2 % , 95 % CI : —0.02 % to 5 % ) , perceived values concordance ( DA 95 % ; DA + VC 92 % ; absolute difference VC — DA —3 % , 95 % CI : —11 % to + 5 % ) , or self-efficacy for risk reduction ( DA 97 % ; DA + VC 92 % ; absolute difference VC — DA —5 % , 95 % CI : —13 % to + 3 % ) . However , DA + VC tended to change some decisions about risk reduction strategies . Limitations . Use of a hypothetical scenario ; ceiling effects for some outcomes . Conclusions . Adding a VC intervention to a DA did not further improve decision-making outcomes in a population of highly educated and motivated adults responding to scenario-based questions . Work is needed to determine the effects of VC on more diverse population s and more distal outcomes', 'Objective To evaluate the efficacy of an evidence -based patient information programme aim ing to increase informed choice in patients with early multiple sclerosis ( MS ) . Background Patients with early MS face a number of uncertainties concerning diagnosis , prognosis and effectiveness of immunotherapy . Prior studies suggest that evidence -based patient information combined with group education can promote informed choice in MS patients . Methods A 12-month , six-centre , double-blind r and omised controlled clinical trial with 192 patients with a diagnosis of confirmed relapsing-remitting MS or clinical isolated syndrome in Germany . A 4-h interactive evidence -based educational programme was compared with a 4-h MS-specific stress management programme . The primary endpoint was informed choice after 6 months comprising risk knowledge and congruency between attitude towards immunotherapy and actual immunotherapy uptake . Secondary endpoints included autonomy preference , decision autonomy , decisional conflict and satisfaction , anxiety and depression , and number of immunotherapies . Results For the primary endpoint , a significant difference was shown with 50 of 85 ( 59 % ) participants in the intervention group achieving informed choice after 6 months compared with 18 of 89 ( 20 % ) in the control group ( OR 0.2 ( 95 % CI 0.1 to 0.4 ) , p<0.001 ) . Four weeks after the intervention , more participants in the intervention group showed good risk knowledge ( difference between groups 39 % ( 95 % CI 26 % to 53 % ) , p<0.001 ) . There were no significant differences between groups for attitude towards immunotherapy and for immunotherapy uptake . There were trends towards increased autonomy preference after the intervention and increased adherence to immunotherapies in the intervention group . Conclusions The intervention significantly increased informed choice and relevant risk knowledge without negative side effects', 'OBJECTIVES As a result of the impact of HIV among men who have sex with men ( MSM ) , multiple strategies for reducing HIV risks have emerged from within the gay community . One common HIV risk reduction strategy limits unprotected sex partners to those who are of the same HIV status ( serosorting ) . We tested a novel , brief , one-on-one intervention , based on informed decision-making and delivered by peer counselors , design ed to address the limitations of serosorting ( e.g. , risk for HIV transmission ) . METHODS In 2009 , we recruited a group of 149 at-risk men living in Atlanta , Georgia , and r and omly assigned them to an intervention condition addressing serosorting or a st and ard-of-care control condition . RESULTS Men in the serosorting intervention reported fewer sexual partners ( Wald χ(2 ) = 8.79 , P < .01 ) at the study follow-ups . Behavioral results were also consistent with changes in psychosocial variables , including condom use self-efficacy and perceptions of risk for HIV transmission . CONCLUSIONS With the current intervention , service providers can offer risk reduction for men arguably at the highest risk for HIV infection in the United States . Addressing risks associated with serosorting in a feasible , low-cost intervention has the potential to significantly affect the HIV epidemic', \"OBJECTIVE To assess patients ' opinion toward receiving written or specialized verbal pharmacists ' interventions and to determine the effect of these interventions on patients ' medication knowledge . METHODS 150 newly diagnosed patients with unipolar depression and initiated with a single antidepressant  were r and omized into 3 groups : control , leaflet and counselling , and interviewed at initiation and after 6 - 8 weeks of treatment at the outpatient department of the Psychiatric Hospital in Kuwait . RESULTS 50 % of respondents asserted that clinicians did not give them sufficient information while 90 % favoured the idea of receiving further information about therapy . Forty seven percent of participants failed to return for the second follow-up appointment . The drop-out rate was 66 % in the control , 42 % in the Leaflet and only 34 % in the counselling groups ( P=0.004 ) . A broad support for receiving leaflets and drug counselling ( 97 % ) was found among attendees . Moreover , 94 % of the counselling and 79 % of the leaflets group affirmed that they received adequate information compared to 47 % of the control ( P=0.001 ) . Counselling was found to be significantly associated with a much higher recall of medicine name ( OR=9.6 , P=0.01 ) , how to manage missed doses ( OR=8.9 , P=0.007 ) , and correct use of medication ( OR=31.3 , P<0.001 ) . Leaflet use was less strongly associated than counselling and was statistically significant for recall regarding correct use of medication ( OR=8.4 , P=0.009 ) . CONCLUSION Pharmacists in a psychiatric institution can play an important role in satisfying patient dem and s for specialized information about their medications . Patients with depression appear very eager to receive additional drug information with modest difference between the written and the verbal counselling interventions . Patients looked at the two interventions in a very positive manner and no difference was observed between patients in the leaflets and in the counselling group with regards to how helpful , sufficient , supportive and reassuring was the educational material . However , both interventions were more informative than the control in conveying elemental drug information to patients . PRACTICE IMPLICATION S In contrast with the lack of enthusiasm that some clinicians express , the affirmativeness that was expressed by patients towards receiving written or verbal specialized educational interventions by pharmacists may support the psychiatric hospital pharmacists ' st and s in providing them for all patients which may aid in improving patients compliance and probably treatment outcome\", 'OBJECTIVE Our community-based participatory research partnership previously evaluated Consultation Planning ( CP ) , a question -listing intervention delivered in-person . We now report on effectiveness , cost , and value of delivering CP by telephone ( Tele-CP ) . METHODS Between 2007 and 2010 , we r and omly assigned rural women with a diagnosis of breast cancer to receive Tele-CP or In-Person CP .  We compared ratings of decision self-efficacy ( 0 minimum to 4 maximum ) with a pre-specified non-inferiority margin of 15 % . We also explored psychosocial and economic outcomes . RESULTS Tele-CP ( n=35 ) recipients reported mean decision self-efficacy ratings of 3.53 versus 3.44 for in-person ( n=32 ) . Under intent-to-treat analysis , we rejected the null hypothesis of greater than 0.52 inferiority for Tele-CP ( 95 % CI for difference : -0.44 to 0.13 , p=0.006 ) . The intervention costs averaged $ 48 for Tele-CP versus $ 78 in-person ( 95 % CI for difference : -$63 to $ 2 ) . Mean willingness-to-pay was $ 154 for Tele-CP and $ 144 for in-person ( 95 % CI for difference : -$88 to $ 108 ) . CONCLUSION Tele-CP was non-inferior to In-Person CP , cost no more , and was equally valued by patients . PRACTICE IMPLICATION S Telephone delivery of Consultation Planning can achieve comparable quality , cost , and value as in-person . Organizations offering Consultation Planning or similar question -listing interventions should consider adopting telephone delivery', 'PURPOSE We wanted to assess the impact of an electronic health record – based diabetes clinical decision support system on control of hemoglobin A1c ( glycated hemoglobin ) , blood pressure , and low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) cholesterol levels in adults with diabetes . METHODS We conducted a clinic-r and omized trial conducted from October 2006 to May 2007 in Minnesota . Included were 11 clinics with 41 consenting primary care physicians and the physicians ’ 2,556 patients with diabetes . Patients were r and omized either to receive or not to receive an electronic health record (EHR)–based clinical decision support system design ed to improve care for those patients whose hemoglobin A1c , blood pressure , or LDL cholesterol levels were higher than goal at any office visit . Analysis used general and generalized linear mixed models with repeated time measurements to accommo date the nested data structure . RESULTS The intervention group physicians used the EHR-based decision support system at 62.6 % of all office visits made by adults with diabetes . The intervention group diabetes patients had significantly better hemoglobin A1c ( intervention effect −0.26 % ; 95 % confidence interval , −0.06 % to −0.47 % ; P=.01 ) , and better maintenance of systolic blood pressure control ( 80.2 % vs 75.1 % , P=.03 ) and borderline better maintenance of diastolic blood pressure control ( 85.6 % vs 81.7 % , P = .07 ) , but not improved low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels ( P = .62 ) than patients of physicians r and omized to the control arm of the study . Among intervention group physicians , 94 % were satisfied or very satisfied with the intervention , and moderate use of the support system persisted for more than 1 year after feedback and incentives to encourage its use were discontinued . CONCLUSIONS EHR-based diabetes clinical decision support  significantly improved glucose control and some aspects of blood pressure control in adults with type 2 diabetes', 'Background Decision support interventions have been developed to help men clarify their values and make informed decisions about prostate cancer testing , but they seldom target high-risk black and immigrant men . Purpose This study evaluated the efficacy of a decision support intervention focused on prostate cancer testing in a sample of predominantly immigrant black men . Methods Black men ( N = 490 ) were r and omized to tailored telephone education about prostate cancer testing or a control condition . Results Post-intervention , the intervention group had significantly greater knowledge , lower decision conflict , and greater likelihood of talking with their physician about prostate cancer testing than the control group . There were no significant intervention effects on prostate specific antigen testing , congruence between testing intention and behavior , or anxiety . Conclusions A tailored telephone decision support intervention can promote informed decision making about prostate cancer testing in black and predominantly immigrant men without increasing testing or anxiety', 'Within the Veterans Health Administration , post-traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) treatment decisions are left to the patient and provider , allowing substantial variability in the way treatment decisions are made . Theorized to increase treatment engagement , shared decision-making interventions provide a st and ardized framework for treatment decisions . This study sought to develop ( phase 1 ) and pilot test the feasibility and potential effectiveness ( phase 2 ) of a brief shared decision-making intervention to promote engagement in evidence -based PTSD treatment . An initial version of the intervention was developed and then modified according to stakeholder feedback . Participants in the pilot trial were 27 Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans recruited during an intake assessment at a Veterans Affairs PTSD clinic . Participants r and omized to the intervention condition ( n = 13 ) participated in a 30-minute shared decision-making session , whereas patients r and omized to the  usual care condition  ( n = 14 ) completed treatment planning during their intake appointment , per usual clinic procedures . Among the 20 study completers , a greater proportion of participants in the intervention condition preferred an evidence -based treatment and received an adequate ( ≥9 sessions ) dose of psychotherapy . Results provide preliminary support for the feasibility and potential effectiveness of the intervention and suggest that larger-scale trials are warranted']\n",
