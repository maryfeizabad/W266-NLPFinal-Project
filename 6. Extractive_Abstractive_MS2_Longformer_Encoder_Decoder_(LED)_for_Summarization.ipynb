controversial and made necessary large studies . The European R and omized study of Screening for Prostate cancer ( ERSPC ) was initiated in 1994 . Eight countries including France are participating . METHODS ERSPC is a multicentric r and omised study and started with the aim to determine whether a 20 % reduction in prostate cancer mortality can be achieved with PSA-based screening .  Men aged 50 - 74 and living in the Tarn or H\\u00e9rault were included . After r and omization and exclusion of men who died or had a prostate cancer were invited to participate by giving their consent and had a PSA test . In case of PSA greater than or equal to 3 ng/ml , biopsy was recommended . Included men in both screening and control group were followed through cancer registries . Objective was to present first round results of French participation to ERSPC , to determine factors of participation and to compare detected cancers cases between both groups . RESULTS Population of men included was 84,781 and were r and omized in screening ( n=42,590 ) or control ( n=42,191 ) group .  Participation rate was 36.9 % in Tarn and 24.3 % in H\\u00e9rault . PSA was greater than or equal to 3 ng/ml in 15,4 % of cases ( n=1812 ) and 45.9 % of men ( n=832 ) who were biopsied . Age , previous PSA performed within two years prior to invitation , health insurance and department of residence were significantly associated to participation rate . Cumulated incidence with a four years follow-up was 2.48 % ( n=1053 ) in screening and 1.99 % ( n=840 ) in control group , with a relative risk ( RR ) of 1.242 . Corresponding RR for Tarn and H\\u00e9rault were 1.37 and 1.20 respectively . Clinical parameters and treatments modalities were similar between both screening and control groups ( radical prostatectomy 68 % and radiation therapy 20 % ) . CONCLUSION Participation rate at first round was modest . Profile of men who participated compared to men who did not were different . The control group was probably contaminated by PSA testing outside study protocol . Consequences at ERSPC level of this low participation rate on final analysis remain to be determined', 'The objectives of the Prostate , Lung , Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial are to determine in screenees ages 55 - 74 at entry whether screening with flexible sigmoidoscopy ( 60-cm sigmoidoscope ) can reduce mortality from colorectal cancer , whether screening with chest X-ray can reduce mortality from lung cancer , whether screening men with digital rectal examination ( DRE ) plus serum prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) can reduce mortality from prostate cancer , and whether screening women with CA125 and transvaginal ultrasound ( TVU ) can reduce mortality from ovarian cancer . Secondary objectives are to assess screening variables other than mortality for each of the interventions including sensitivity , specificity , and positive predictive value ; to assess incidence , stage , and survival of cancer cases ; and to investigate biologic and /or prognostic characterizations of tumor tissue and biochemical products as intermediate endpoints . The design is a multicenter , two-armed , r and omized trial with 37,000 females and 37,000 males in each of the two arms . In the intervention arm , the  PSA and CA125 tests  are performed at entry , then annually for 5 years . The  DRE , TVU , and chest X-ray exams  are performed at entry and then annually for 3 years . Sigmoidoscopy is performed at entry and then at the 5-year point . Participants in the control arm follow their usual medical care practice s. Participants will be followed for at least 13 years from r and omization to ascertain all cancers of the prostate , lung , colorectum , and ovary , as well as deaths from all causes . A pilot phase was undertaken to assess the r and omization , screening , and data collection procedures of the trial and to estimate design parameters such as compliance and contamination levels . This paper describes eligibility , consent , and other design features of the trial , r and omization and screening procedures , and an outline of the follow-up procedures . Sample -size calculations are reported , and a data analysis plan is presented', 'BACKGROUND Prostate cancer ( PC ) screening with prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) has been shown to decrease PC mortality by the European R and omized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer ( ERSPC ) . We evaluated mortality results in the Finnish Prostate Cancer Screening Trial , the largest component of ERSPC . The primary endpoint was PC-specific mortality . METHODS A total of 80 144 men were identified from the population registry and r and omized to either a  screening arm ( SA ) or a  control arm ( CA ) . Men in the SA were invited to serum PSA determination up to three times with a 4-year interval between each scan and referred to biopsy if the PSA concentration was greater than or equal to 4.0 ng/mL or 3.0 to 3.99 ng/mL with a free/total PSA ratio less than or equal to 16 % . Men in the CA received usual care . The analysis covers follow-up to 12 years from r and omization for all men . Hazard ratios ( HRs ) were estimated for incidence and mortality using Cox proportional hazard model . All statistical tests were two-sided . RESULTS PC incidence was 8.8 per 1000 person-years in the SA and 6.6 in the CA ( HR = 1.34 , 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] = 1.27 to 1.40 ) . The incidence of advanced PC was lower in the SA vs CA arm ( 1.2 vs 1.6 , respectively ; HR = 0.73 , 95 % CI = 0.64 to 0.82 ; P < .001 ) . For PC mortality , no statistically significant difference was observed between the SA and CA ( HR = 0.85 , 95 % CI = 0.69 to 1.04 ) ( with intention-to-screen analysis ) . To avoid one PC death , we needed to invite 1199 men to screening and to detect 25 PCs . We observed no difference in all-cause mortality between trial arms . CONCLUSIONS At 12 years , a relatively conservative screening protocol produced a small , non-statistically significant PC-specific mortality reduction in the Finnish trial , at the cost of moderate overdiagnosis', 'BACKGROUND Prostate cancer is one of the leading causes of death from malignant disease among men in the developed world . One strategy to decrease the risk of death from this disease is screening with prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) ; however , the extent of benefit and harm with such screening is under continuous debate . METHODS In December , 1994 , 20,000 men born between 1930 and 1944 , r and omly sample d from the population register , were r and omised by computer in a 1:1 ratio to either a screening group invited for PSA testing every 2 years ( n=10,000 ) or to a control group not invited ( n=10,000 ) . Men in the screening group were invited up to the upper age limit ( median 69 , range 67 - 71 years ) and only men with raised PSA concentrations were offered additional tests such as digital rectal examination and prostate biopsies . The primary endpoint was prostate-cancer specific mortality , analysed according to the intention-to-screen principle . The study is ongoing , with men who have not reached the upper age limit invited for PSA testing . This is the first planned report on cumulative prostate-cancer incidence and mortality calculated up to Dec 31 , 2008 . This study is registered as an International St and ard R and omised Controlled Trial IS RCT N54449243 . FINDINGS In each group , 48 men were excluded from the analysis because of death or emigration before the r and omisation date , or prevalent prostate cancer . In men r and omised to screening , 7578 ( 76 % ) of 9952 attended at least once . During a median follow-up of 14 years , 1138 men in the screening group and 718 in the control group  were diagnosed with prostate cancer , result ing in a cumulative prostate-cancer incidence of 12.7 % in the screening group and 8.2 % in the  control  group ( hazard ratio 1.64 ; 95 % CI 1.50 - 1.80 ; p<0.0001 ) . The absolute cumulative risk reduction of death from prostate cancer at 14 years was 0.40 % ( 95 % CI 0.17 - 0.64 ) , from 0.90 % in the control group to 0.50 % in the screening group . The rate ratio for death from prostate cancer was 0.56 ( 95 % CI 0.39 - 0.82 ; p=0.002 ) in the screening compared with the control group . The rate ratio of death from prostate cancer for attendees compared with the control group was 0.44 ( 95 % CI 0.28 - 0.68 ; p=0.0002 ) . Overall , 293 ( 95 % CI 177 - 799 ) men needed to be invited for screening and 12 to be diagnosed to prevent one prostate cancer death . INTERPRETATION This study shows that prostate cancer mortality was reduced almost by half over 14 years . However , the risk of over-diagnosis is substantial and the number needed to treat is at least as high as in breast-cancer screening programmes . The benefit of prostate-cancer screening compares favourably to other cancer screening programs . FUNDING The Swedish Cancer Society , the Swedish Research Council , and the National Cancer Institute', 'Objective To assess whether screening for prostate cancer reduces prostate cancer specific mortality . Design Population based r and omised controlled trial . Setting Department of Urology , Norrk\\u00f6ping , and the South-East Region Prostate Cancer Register . Participants All men aged 50 - 69 in the city of Norrk\\u00f6ping , Sweden , identified in 1987 in the National Population Register ( n=9026 ) . Intervention From the study population , 1494 men were r and omly allocated to be screened by including every sixth man from a list of date s of birth . These men were invited to be screened every third year from 1987 to 1996 . On the first two occasions screening was done by digital rectal examination only . From 1993 , this was combined with prostate specific antigen testing , with 4 \\u00b5g/L as cut off . On the fourth occasion ( 1996 ) , only men aged 69 or under at the time of the investigation were invited . Main outcome measures Data on tumour stage , grade , and treatment from the South East Region Prostate Cancer Register . Prostate cancer specific mortality up to 31 December 2008 . Results In the four screenings from 1987 to 1996 attendance was 1161/1492 ( 78 % ) , 957/1363 ( 70 % ) , 895/1210 ( 74 % ) , and 446/606 ( 74 % ) , respectively . There were 85 cases ( 5.7 % ) of prostate cancer diagnosed in the screened group and 292 ( 3.9 % ) in the control group . The risk ratio for death from prostate cancer in the screening group was 1.16 ( 95 % confidence interval 0.78 to 1.73 ) . In a Cox proportional hazard analysis comparing prostate cancer specific survival in the control group with that in the screened group , the hazard ratio for death from prostate cancer was 1.23 ( 0.94 to 1.62 ; P=0.13 ) . After adjustment for age at start of the study , the hazard ratio was 1.58 ( 1.06 to 2.36 ; P=0.024 ) . Conclusions After 20 years of follow-up the rate of death from prostate cancer did not differ significantly between men in the screening group and those in the  control group . Trial registration Current Controlled Trials , IS RCT N06342431', 'BACKGROUND The effect of screening with prostate-specific-antigen ( PSA ) testing and digital rectal examination on the rate of death from prostate cancer is unknown . This is the first report from the Prostate , Lung , Colorectal , and Ovarian ( PLCO ) Cancer Screening Trial on prostate-cancer mortality . METHODS From 1993 through 2001 , we r and omly assigned 76,693 men at 10 U.S. study centers to receive either annual screening ( 38,343 subjects ) or usual care as the control ( 38,350 subjects ) . Men in the screening group were offered annual PSA testing for 6 years and digital rectal examination for 4 years . The subjects and health care providers received the results and decided on the type of follow-up evaluation . Usual care sometimes included screening , as some organizations have recommended . The numbers of all cancers and deaths and causes of death were ascertained . RESULTS In the screening group , rates of compliance were 85 % for PSA testing and 86 % for digital rectal examination . Rates of screening in the control group increased from 40 % in the first year to 52 % in the sixth year for PSA testing and ranged from 41 to 46 % for digital rectal examination . After 7 years of follow-up , the incidence of prostate cancer per 10,000 person-years was 116 ( 2820 cancers ) in the screening group and 95 ( 2322 cancers ) in the control group ( rate ratio , 1.22 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 1.16 to 1.29 ) . The incidence of death per 10,000 person-years was 2.0 ( 50 deaths ) in the screening group and 1.7 ( 44 deaths ) in the control group ( rate ratio , 1.13 ; 95 % CI , 0.75 to 1.70 ) . The data at 10 years were 67 % complete and consistent with these overall findings . CONCLUSIONS After 7 to 10 years of follow-up , the rate of death from prostate cancer was very low and did not differ significantly between the two study groups . ( Clinical Trials.gov number , NCT00002540 .', 'BACKGROUND The prostate component of the Prostate , Lung , Colorectal , and Ovarian ( PLCO ) Cancer Screening Trial was undertaken to determine whether there is a reduction in prostate cancer mortality from screening using serum prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) testing and digital rectal examination ( DRE ) . Mortality after 7 - 10 years of follow-up has been reported previously . We report extended follow-up to 13 years after the trial . METHODS A total of 76 685 men , aged 55 - 74 years , were enrolled at 10 screening centers between November 1993 and July 2001 and r and omly assigned to the intervention  ( organized screening of annual PSA testing for 6 years and annual DRE for 4 years ; 38 340 men ) and control ( usual care , which sometimes included opportunistic screening ; 38 345 men ) arms . Screening was completed in October 2006 . All incident prostate cancers and deaths from prostate cancer through 13 years of follow-up or through December 31 , 2009 , were ascertained . Relative risks ( RRs ) were estimated as the ratio of observed rates in the intervention and control arms , and 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs ) were calculated assuming a Poisson distribution for the number of events . Poisson regression modeling was used to examine the interactions with respect to prostate cancer mortality between trial arm and age , comorbidity status , and pretrial PSA testing . All statistical tests were two-sided . RESULTS Approximately 92 % of the study participants were followed to 10 years and 57 % to 13 years . At 13 years , 4250 participants had been diagnosed with prostate cancer in the intervention arm compared with 3815 in the control arm . Cumulative incidence rates for prostate cancer in the intervention and control arms were 108.4 and 97.1 per 10 000 person-years , respectively , result ing in a relative increase of 12 % in the intervention arm ( RR = 1.12 , 95 % CI = 1.07 to 1.17 ) . After 13 years of follow-up , the cumulative mortality rates from prostate cancer in the intervention and control arms were 3.7 and 3.4 deaths per 10 000 person-years , respectively , result ing in a non-statistically significant difference between the two arms ( RR = 1.09 , 95 % CI = 0.87 to 1.36 ) . No statistically significant interactions with respect to prostate cancer mortality were observed between trial arm and age ( P(interaction ) = .81 ) , pretrial PSA testing ( P(interaction ) = .52 ) , and comorbidity ( P(interaction ) = .68 ) . CONCLUSIONS After 13 years of follow-up , there was no evidence of a mortality benefit for organized annual screening in the PLCO trial compared with opportunistic screening , which forms part of usual care , and there was no apparent interaction with age , baseline comorbidity , or pretrial PSA testing', \\\"PURPOSE This clinical trial is aim ed at evaluating the impact of prostate cancer screening on cancer-specific mortality . SUBJECTS AND METHODS Forty-six thous and four hundred and eighty-six ( 46,486 ) men aged 45 - 80 years registered in the electoral roll of the Quebec city area were r and omized in 1988 between screening and no screening . Screening included measurement of serum prostatic specific antigen ( PSA ) using 3.0 ng/ml as upper limit of normal and digital rectal examination ( DRE ) at first visit . At follow-up visits , serum PSA only was used . RESULTS Seventy-four ( 74 ) deaths from prostate cancer occurred in the 14,231 unscreened controls while 10 deaths were observed in the screened group of 7,348 men during the first 11 years following r and omization . Median follow-up of screened men was 7.93 years . A Cox proportional hazards model of the age at death from prostate cancer shows a 62 % reduction ( P < 0.002 , Fisher 's exact test ) of cause-specific mortality in the screened men ( P = 0.005 ) . These results are in agreement with the continuous decrease of prostate cancer mortality observed in North America\\\", 'BACKGROUND The incidence of prostate cancer has increased substantially since it became common practice to screen asymptomatic men for the disease . The European R and omized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer ( ERSPC ) was initiated in 1993 to determine how prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) screening affects prostate cancer mortality . Variations in the screening algorithm , such as the interval between screening rounds , likely influence the morbidity , mortality , and quality of life of the screened population . METHODS We compared the number and characteristics of interval cancers , defined as those diagnosed during the screening interval but not detected by screening , in men in the screening arm of the ERSPC who were aged 55 - 65 years at the time of the first screening and were participating through two centers of the ERSPC : Gothenburg ( 2-year screening interval , n = 4202 ) and Rotterdam ( 4-year screening interval , n = 13301 ) . All participants who were diagnosed with prostate cancer through December 31 , 2005 , but at most 10 years after the initial screening were ascertained by linkage with the national cancer registries . A potentially life-threatening ( aggressive ) interval cancer was defined as one with at least one of the following characteristics at diagnosis : stage M1 or N1 , plasma PSA concentration greater than 20.0 ng/mL , or Gleason score greater than 7 . We used Mantel Cox regression to assess differences between rates of interval cancers and aggressive interval cancers at the two centers . All statistical tests were two-sided . RESULTS The 10-year cumulative incidence of all prostate cancers in Rotterdam versus Gothenburg was 1118 ( 8.41 % ) versus 552 ( 13.14 % ) ( P<.001 ) , the cumulative incidence of interval cancer was 57 ( 0.43 % ) versus 31 ( 0.74 % ) ( P = .51 ) , and the cumulative incidence of aggressive interval cancer was 15 ( 0.11 % ) versus 5 ( 0.12 % ) ( P = .72 ) . CONCLUSION The rate of interval cancer , especially aggressive interval cancer , was low in this study . The 2-year screening interval had higher detection rates than the 4-year interval but did not lead to lower rates of interval and aggressive interval prostate cancers', 'The extent of effective prostate\\u2010specific antigen ( PSA ) contamination in the Rotterdam section of the ongoing European R and omized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer ( ERSPC ) trial was evaluated and defined as when opportunistic PSA testing of \\u2265 3.0 ng/ml was followed by biopsy , similar to the regular procedure within the trial . Records of participants aged 55\\u201374 years at entry were linked to the regional data base of the general practitioner ( GP ) laboratory to obtain PSA tests requested by GPs in the period 1 July 1997 to 31 May 2000 ( 2.9 years ) , and to the national pathology data base to quantify the number of biopsies . All men r and omized were included , only those with prostate cancer screen\\u2010detected or clinical ly diagnosed before July 1997 were omitted from the analyses . 2,895 out of the 14,349 men ( 20.2 % ) in the control arm and 1,981 out of the 14,052 men ( 14.1 % ) in the screening arm were  PSA\\u2010tested  , at an average annual rate of 73 and 52 per 1,000 person\\u2010years , respectively . These rates were higher than those recorded at the national and regional levels , 33 and 38 per 1,000 person\\u2010years , respectively . Opportunistic PSA testing in the control arm reached a peak within the first months of r and omization , after which it decreased to around 70 per 1,000 person\\u2010years . An opposite pattern was observed in the screening arm , where participants already had received the scheduled screening within the trial . The proportion of men in the control arm with PSA \\u2265 3.0 ng/ml followed by biopsy and prostate cancer was 7\\u20138 % and 3 % , respectively ( 3 % and 0.4\\u20130.6 % in the screening arm ) , over the whole study period . Over a 4\\u2010year rescreening interval , the average PSA and effective contamination amount were approximately 28 % and 10 % , respectively . PSA testing in the control arm in the Rotterdam ERSPC section is high , but was not followed by a substantial increase in prostate biopsies . Although the reasons for ordering PSA test or indicating biopsy are unknown , effective PSA contamination in the Rotterdam ERSPC section is low and not likely to jeopardize the power of the trial . \\u00a9 2003 Wiley\\u2010Liss ,', 'OBJECTIVE To address if prostate cancer ( PCa ) screening decreases PCa mortality in the asymptomatic population , within the setting of the Spanish arm of the European R and omized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer ( ERSPC ) . MATERIAL AND METHODS From 1996 to 1999 , 4,278 men aged 45 - 70 years were recruited and r and omized to the screening arm ( PSA every 4 years , prostate biopsy when PSA \\u22653 ng/ml ) and control arm ( no tests ) . Date s and causes of death were collected on an annual basis . A Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to calculate overall and cancer-specific survival . RESULTS A total of 2,416 men were recruited in the screening arm and 1,862 in the control arm . Mean age was 57.8 years , median follow-up was 13.3 years . At the end of the follow-up period , 427 deaths ( 9 from PCa ) were observed . Survival analysis did not show any difference between the study arms with respect to overall and cancer-specific survival ( p=0.939 and p=0.544 respectively ) . Most relevant causes of death were malignant tumors ( 52.9 % ) , cardiovascular disease ( 17.3 % ) and respiratory ( 8.9 % ) . Only 2.1 % of deaths ( 0.2 % of all recruited men ) were due to PCa ( 2.5 % screening , 1.6 % control ) . CONCLUSIONS The Spanish arm of ERSPC failed to reproduce the long-term results shown in the whole study . No differences in mortality ( overall or cancer-specific ) were observed after 15 years of follow-up . PCa mortality was infrequent ( less than 1 % ) . These results suggest limited yield of PCa screening in our setting', 'Screening for prostate cancer ( PC ) remains a controversial issue despite some new evidence on the mortality benefits of PC screening . We conducted a prospect i ve , r and omized screening trial in Finl and to investigate whether screening decreases PC incidence . Here , we report the incidence results from three screening rounds during a 12-year period . Of the 80,144 men enrolled , 31,866 men were r and omized to the screening arm ( SA ) and invited for screening with prostate-specific antigen test ( cut-off 4.0 ng/ml ) every 4 years , while the remaining men formed the control arm ( CA ) that received no interventions . The mean follow-up time for PC incidence in both arms was over 9 years . The incidence rate of PC ( including screen-detected and interval cancers as well as cases among non participants ) was 9.1 per 1,000 person-years in the SA and 6.2 in the CA , yielding an incidence rate ratio ( IRR ) 1.5 ( 95 % confidence interval 1.4 - 1.5 ) . The incidence of advanced PC was 1.1 in the SA and 1.5 in the CA , IRR = 0.7 ( 0.6 - 0.8 ) and the difference emerges after 5 - 6 years of follow-up . The incidence of localized PC was 7.5 in the SA and 4.6 in the CA , IRR = 1.6 ( 1.5 - 1.7 ) . The results from our large population -based trial indicate that screening for PC decreases the incidence of advanced PC . When compared with the CA , the PC detected in the SA there were substantially more often localized , low- grade PCs due to overdiagnosis', \\\"To report the results from  Switzerl and 's participation in the ERSPC from 1998 ; importantly , epidemiological data showed that Switzerl and has one of the highest rates of morbidity and mortality from prostate cancer in the world . The local study protocol was accepted by the ethical committee and after the successful pilot study phase , the centre joined the ERSPC\\\", 'BACKGROUND Screening for prostate cancer ( PC ) with prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) has been shown to decrease mortality , but has adverse effects , such as false-positive ( FP ) screening results . We describe the frequency of FP results and assess their relation to subsequent screening attendance , test results and prostate cancer risk in a large r and omized trial . MATERIAL S AND METHODS We included data from five centres of the European R and omized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer , altogether over 61,000 screened men . Men were screened with PSA test at a 2 - 7 year interval depending on the centre ; PSA cut-off was 3.0 - 4.0 ng/ml . A positive screen with no histologically confirmed PC in biopsy within 1 year was defined as an FP result . RESULTS Of the 61,604 men who were screened at least once , 17.8 % had one or more FP result ( s ) . Almost 20 % of men who participated at all screening rounds had one or more FP result ( s ) . More than half of the men with an FP result had another FP if screened again . Men with FP results had a fourfold risk of PC at subsequent screen ( depending on the round , 10.0 % versus 2.6 - 2.7 % of men with negative screen , risk ratio 3.8 - 3.9 ) . The PCs following an FP result were in 92.8 % of cases localised and low- grade versus 90.4 % following a screen-negative result . CONCLUSIONS Our results show that FP results are common adverse effects in PC screening , as they affect at least one in six screened men . False-positive men are more prone to be diagnosed with PC but are also likely to have consistently high PSA levels', \\\"PURPOSE Estimates of prostate cancer-specific mortality ( PCSM ) were similar for men r and omly assigned to intervention compared with usual care  on the Prostate , Lung , Colorectal and Ovarian PC screening study . However , results analyzed by comorbidity strata remain unknown . PATIENTS AND METHODS Between 1993 and 2001 , of 76,693 men who were r and omly assigned to usual care or intervention at 10 US centers , 73,378 ( 96 % ) completed a question naire that inquired about comorbidity and prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) testing before r and om assignment . Fine and Gray 's multivariable analysis was performed to assess whether the r and omized screening arm was associated with the risk of PCSM in men with no or minimal versus at least one significant comorbidity , adjusting for age and prer and omization PSA testing . RESULTS After 10 years of follow-up , 9,565 deaths occurred , 164 from PC . A significant decrease in the risk of PCSM ( 22 v 38 deaths ; adjusted hazard ratio [ AHR ] , 0.56 ; 95 % CI , 0.33 to 0.95 ; P = .03 ) was observed in men with no or minimal comorbidity r and omly assigned to intervention versus usual care , and the additional number needed to treat to prevent one PC death at 10 years was five . Among men with at least one significant comorbidity , those r and omly assigned to intervention versus usual care did not have a decreased risk of PCSM ( 62 v 42 deaths ; AHR , 1.43 ; 95 % CI , 0.96 to 2.11 ; P = .08 ) . CONCLUSION Selective use of PSA screening for men in good health appears to reduce the risk of PCSM with minimal overtreatment\\\", 'The specific details of the French national programme are based on the design of a local mass screening programme .  Men in the screening group are repeatedly invited by mail to be screened while no information other that the national available guidelines on the use of prostate\\u2010specific antigen ( PSA ) is offered to the control group . The protocol includes r and omization before information and consent . In addition , knowledge of any pre\\u2010existing PSA test is obtained through the health insurance data base . This will allow separate analysis , if necessary , between groups with previous PSA testing ( low participation rate expected ) and without ( higher participation rate expected )', 'From 1992 - 2001 , 7 countries in Europe gradually recruited men for the European R and omised Screening for Prostate Cancer ( ERSPC ) trial . Centres recruit different age groups and have different design s for recruiting and countries have different underlying risks for prostate cancer . Recruitment has reached 163,126 men aged 55 - 69 at entry now . Our purpose was to calculate the power of the trial and at what point in time can statistically significant differences in prostate cancer mortality be expected . Recruitment data were collected from the screening centres .  We calculated the expected number of prostate cancer deaths in each follow-up year , based on national statistics and expected rate in trial entrants . The power was calculated using different assumptions on intervention effect and contamination rate and also if the ERSPC trial would cooperate with other trials . With an assumed 25 % intervention effect in men actually screened and a 20 % contamination rate , the trial will reach a power of 0.86 in 2008 . With an assumed intervention effect of 40 % , the power reaches 0.90 in 2003 - 2004 . Pooling data with those of the Prostate , Lung , Colorectal and Ovary ( PLCO ) trial early is expected to improve the power to 79 % ( 20 % intervention effect ) to 92 % ( 40 % intervention effect PLCO ) . Adding more centres with compliance rates lower than 45 % decreases the power of the trial . The ERSPC trial has sufficient power to detect a significant difference in prostate cancer mortality between the 2 arms if the true reduction in mortality by screening is 25 % or more or if contamination remains limited to 10 % if the true effect is 20 % or more . If early detection and treatment turns out to have a stronger effect as may be suggested by observational data , the ERSPC trial is likely to conclusively show that within the next 5 years', 'Two large\\u2010scale r and omized screening trials , the Prostate , Lung , Colorectal and Ovary ( PLCO ) cancer trial in the USA and the European R and omized Screening for Prostate Cancer ( ERSPC ) trial in Europe are currently under way , aim ed at assessing whether screening reduces prostate cancer mortality . Up to the end of 1998 , 102,691 men have been r and omized to the intervention arm and 115,322 to the control arm ( which represents 83 % of the target sample size ) from 7 European countries and 10 screening centers in the USA . The principal screening method at all centers is determination of  serum prostate\\u2010specific antigen ( PSA ) . The PLCO trial and some European centers use also  digital rectal examination ( DRE )  as an ancillary screening test . In the core age group ( 55\\u201369 years ) , 3,362 of 32,486 men screened ( 10 % ) had a  serum PSA concentration of 4 ng/ml or greater , which is 1 cut\\u2010off for biopsy ( performed in 84 % ) . An additional 6 % was referred for further assessment based on other criteria , with much less efficiency . Differences in PSA by country are largely attributable to the age structure of the study population . The mean age\\u2010specific PSA levels are lower in the PLCO trial ( 1.64 ng/ml [ in the age group 55\\u201359 years ] , 1.80 [ 60\\u201364 years ] and 2.18 [ 65\\u201369 years ) than in the ERSPC trial ( 1.28\\u20131.71 [ 55\\u201359 ] , 1.75\\u20132.87 [ 60\\u201364 ] and 2.48\\u20133.06 [ 65\\u201369 years ] ) . Detection rates at the first screen in the ERSPC trial range from 11 to 42/1,000 men screened and reflect underlying differences in incidence rates and screening procedures . In centers with consent to r and omization design , adherence in the screening arm is 91 % , but less than half of the men in the target population are enrolled in the trial . In population \\u2010based centers in which men were r and omized prior to consent , all eligible subjects are enrolled , but only about two\\u2010thirds of the men in the intervention arm undergo screening . Considerable progress has been made in both trials . Enrollment will be completed in 2001 . A substantial number of early prostate cancers have been detected . The differences between countries seem to reflect both underlying prostate cancer incidence and screening policy . The trials have the power to show definitive results in 2005\\u20132008 . \\u00a9 2002 Wiley\\u2010Liss ,', \\\"Prostate cancer has become the most frequent cancer and the second cause of cancer mortality in men . This public health problem is becoming increasingly important due to the increasing life expectancy . At the present time , prostate cancer will be discovered in one in every eight men during their lifetime . Prostate cancer represents 25 % of all new cases of male cancers . Prostate cancer screening is design ed to detect early stage , asymptomatic prostate cancer , as the patient 's chances of cure are higher when the cancer is diagnosed at an early stage . The conclusions of the ANAES evaluation in 1998 did not recommend mass screening for prostate cancer . Several international prospect i ve r and omized studies based on serum PSA assay , sometimes associated with digital rectal examination , are currently underway . France is participating in the European ERSPC study ( European R and omized Study of Screening for Cancer Prostate ) and is organizing a national study on high-risk population s. While waiting for the final results of these studies , a recommendation needs to be proposed to inform general practitioners and specialists about optimal use of the currently available tests . Based on the conclusions of its oncology committee ( composed of urologists , medical oncologists , radiotherapists , pathologists and radiologists ) , the Association Fran\\u00e7aise d'Urologie proposes a recommendation concerning prostate cancer screening and defines its modalities , especially concerning the target population , screening tests and the information given to men before screening . The Association Fran\\u00e7aise d'Urologie recommends prostate cancer screening by PSA assay ( prostate specific antigen ) and digital rectal examination annually between the ages of 50 and 75 years , and from the age of 45 years in men with a family or ethnic risk . If total PSA is above the normal value of the test or if digital rectal examination is abnormal , referral to a urologist is recommended . Information concerning the limits , benefits and risks of screening and the available treatment options must be given before performing these examinations\\\", 'OBJECTIVE To test the feasibility of a population -based prostate cancer screening programme in general practice and explore the outcome after a 15-year follow-up period . METHODS From the total population of men aged 50 - 69 years in Norrk\\u00f6ping ( n = 9026 ) every sixth man ( n = 1494 ) was r and omly selected to be screened for prostate cancer every third year over a 12-year period . The remaining 7532 men were treated as controls . In 1987 and 1990 only  digital rectal examination ( DRE )  was performed , in 1993 and 1996 DRE was combined with a test for Prostate-Specific Antigen ( PSA ) .  TNM categories , grade of malignancy , management and cause of death were recorded in the South-East Region Prostate Cancer Register . RESULTS There were 85 ( 5.7 % ) cancers detected in the screened group ( SG ) , 42 of these in the interval between screenings , and 292 ( 3.8 % ) in the unscreened group ( UG ) . In the SG 48 ( 56.5 % ) of the tumours and in the UG 78 ( 26.7 % ) were localised at diagnosis ( p < 0.001 ) . In the SG 21 ( 25 % ) and in the UG 41 ( 14 % ) received curative treatment . There was no significant difference in total or prostate cancer-specific survival between the groups . CONCLUSIONS Although PSA had not been introduced in the clinical practice at the start of the study , we were still able to show that it is possible to perform a long-term population -based r and omised controlled study with st and ardised management and that screening in general practice is an efficient way of detecting prostate cancer whilst it is localised . Complete data on stage , treatment and mortality for both groups was obtained from a vali date d cancer register , which is a fundamental prerequisite when assessing screening programmes', 'OBJECTIVE To describe the natural history of initially untreated early-stage prostate cancer . A key secondary objective was to calculate long-term survival rates by stage , grade , and age at diagnosis . DESIGN Prospect i ve cohort study . SETTING Population -based in 1 county of Sweden , without screening for prostate cancer . PATIENTS A group of 642 patients with prostate cancer of any stage , consecutively diagnosed between 1977 and 1984 at a mean age of 72 years with complete follow-up to 1994 . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Proportion of patients who died from prostate cancer , and 15-year survival ( with 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] ) , corrected for causes of death other than prostate cancer . RESULTS In the entire cohort , prostate cancer accounted for 201 ( 37 % ) of all 541 deaths . Among 300 patients with a diagnosis of localized disease ( T0-T2 ) , 33 ( 11 % ) died of prostate cancer . In this group , the corrected 15-year survival rate was similar in 223 patients with deferred treatment ( 81 % ; 95 % CI , 72%-89 % ) and in 77 who received initial treatment ( 81 % ; 95 % CI , 67%-95 % ) . The corrected 15-year survival was 57 % ( 95 % CI , 45%-68 % ) in 183 patients with locally advanced cancer ( T3-T4 ) and 6 % ( 95 % CI , 0%-12 % ) in those 159 who had distant metastases at the time of diagnosis . CONCLUSION Patients with localized prostate cancer have a favorable outlook following watchful waiting , and the number of deaths potentially avoidable by radical initial treatment is limited . Without reliable prognostic indicators , an aggressive approach to all patients with early disease would entail substantial overtreatment . In contrast , patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease need trials of aggressive therapy to improve their poor prognosis', 'PURPOSE We evaluated long-term survival in attendees and nonattendees of a 1-time screening for prostate cancer . MATERIAL S AND METHODS A total of 2,400 men 55 to 70 years old in 1988 were r and omly selected and invited to a screening for prostate cancer . Of the invited men 1,782 ( 74 % ) attended . Screening attendees were examined with digital rectal examination , transrectal ultrasound and prostate specific antigen analysis .  When cancer was suspected , prostate biopsies were taken . A total of 65 men with prostate cancer were detected by this procedure . The entire source population comprising 27,204 men , including 618 nonattendees ( 26 % ) , was followed for prostate cancer diagnosis and survival for 15 years . RESULTS Incidence rate ratios were calculated using Poisson regression models . We found no effect of this screening procedure on the risk of death from prostate cancer and other causes of death ( incidence rate ratio 1.10 , 95 % CI 0.83 - 1.46 and 0.98 , 95 % CI 0.92 - 1.05 , respectively ) when comparing all invited men with the source population . However , attending the screening program was associated with a significantly decreased risk of death from causes other than prostate cancer ( vs source population incidence rate ratio 0.82 , 95 % CI 0.76 - 0.90 ) . In contrast , the corresponding incidence rate ratio in nonattendees was 1.53 ( 95 % CI 1.37 - 1.71 ) . CONCLUSIONS We found no evidence of a beneficial effect of this specific screening procedure but strong evidence of a difference in overall survival in screening attendees and nonattendees . These findings should be considered when interpreting previous and upcoming studies of the effect of screening programs', 'OBJECTIVES R and omized controlled trials are currently conducted to assess whether the mortality from prostate cancer is reduced by early detection with the use of prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) measurements in serum . To be effective , such a program should be able to reduce the absolute number of men diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer ( for which no cure is available ) . The aim of the present report is to evaluate whether PSA-based screening reduces the risk of being diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer . METHODS A population -based , prospect i ve , r and omized , controlled screening trial for prostate cancer started in 1995 ( the G\\u00f6teborg branch of the European R and omized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer [ ERSPC ] ) . Ten thous and , r and omly selected men aged 50 - 66 yr were invited for biennial PSA testing , with 10,000 men serving as passive controls for whom diagnosis of metastatic prostate cancer was monitored by using the Swedish Cancer Registry . RESULTS After a follow-up of 10 yr , the risk of being diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer was reduced by 48.9%-that is , decreasing from 47 cases in the control group to 24 cases in the group r and omized to PSA-based screening ( p=0.0084 ) . However , the risk of being diagnosed with prostate cancer increased 1.8-fold with PSA-based screening . CONCLUSIONS Biennial PSA screening reduces the risk of being diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer , the first prerequisite for achieving decreased cancer mortality  in younger men . This putative benefit is balanced by a 1.8-fold increased risk for diagnosis of prostate cancer', 'To report the initial results from Sweden of a large population \\u2010based r and omized study of screening using prostate\\u2010specific antigen ( PSA ) to detect prostate cancer , as the efficacy of such screening to decrease prostate cancer mortality has not yet been proven', 'BACKGROUND Evidence from r and omized trials on the effects of screening for prostate cancer ( PCa ) on disease-specific mortality accumulates slowly with increasing follow-up .

DESIGN , SETTING , AND PARTICIPANTS A r and omized controlled trial with r and omization after signed , written informed consent ( efficacy trial ) . In the period 1993 - 1999 , a total of 42 376 men aged 54 - 74 yr were r and omized to a screening arm ( S-arm )  ( n = 21 210 with screening every 4 yr , applying a total prostate-specific antigen [ PSA ] level cut-off \\u2265 3.0 ng/ml as biopsy indication ) or a control arm ( C-arm ) ( n = 21 166 ; no intervention ) . OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Number of PCas detected per arm depicted by predefined time periods and prognostic groups . PCa-specific mortality analyses using Poisson regression in age group 55 - 74 yr at r and omization and separately in the predefined age group of 55 - 69 yr . RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS After a median follow-up of 12.8 yr , 19 765 men ( 94.2 % ) were screened at least once and 2674 PCas were detected ( of which 561 [ 21.0 % ] were interval PCas ) . In the C-arm , 1430 PCas were detected , result ing in an excess incidence of 59 PCas per 1000 men r and omized ( 61 PCas per 1000 in age group 55 - 69 yr ) . Thirty-two percent of all men r and omized have died . PCa-specific mortality relative-risk ( RR ) reductions of 20.0 % overall ( age : 55 - 74 yr ; p = 0.042 ) and 31.6 % ( age : 55 - 69 yr ; p = 0.004 ) were found . A 14.1 % increase was found in men aged 70 - 74 yr ( not statistically significant ) . Absolute PCa mortality was 1.8 per 1000 men r and omized ( 2.6 per 1000 men r and omized in age group 55 - 69 yr ) . The number needed to invite and number needed to manage were 565 and 33 , respectively , for age group 55 - 74 yr , and 392 and 24 , respectively , for age group 65 - 69 yr . Given the slow natural history of the disease , follow-up might be too short . CONCLUSIONS Systematic PSA-based screening reduced PCa-specific mortality by 32 % in the age range of 55 - 69 yr . The roughly twofold higher incidence in the S-arm underlines the importance of tools to better identify those men who would benefit from screening']\",\n          \"[\\\"BACKGROUND There is increased pressure on primary care physicians to monitor oral anticoagulation . OBJECTIVE To test the null hypothesis that oral anticoagulation care can be provided at least as well in primary care through a nurse-led clinic , involving near-patient testing and computerized decision support software , compared with routine hospital management based on a variety of clinical outcome measures . METHODS A r and omized , controlled trial in 12 primary care practice s in Birmingham , Engl and ( 9 intervention and 3 control ) . Two control population s were used :  patients individually r and omly allocated as controls in the intervention practice s ( intra practice controls ) and all patients in control practice s ( inter practice controls ) . Intervention practice s ' patients were r and omized to the intervention ( practice -based anticoagulation clinic ) or control ( hospital clinic ) group . The main outcome measure was therapeutic control of the international normalized ratio . RESULTS Three hundred sixty-seven patients were recruited ( 122 intervention patients , 102 intra practice control patients , and 143 inter practice control patients ) . St and ard measures of control of the international normalized ratio ( point prevalence ) showed no significant difference between the intervention and control groups . Data on proportion of time spent in the international normalized ratio range showed significant improvement for patients in the intervention group ( paired t test , P = .008 ) . CONCLUSIONS Nurse-led anticoagulation clinics can be implemented in novice primary care setting s by means of computerized decision support software and near-patient testing . Care given by this model is at least as good as routine hospital follow-up . The model is generalizable to primary health care centers operating in developed health care systems\\\", 'OBJECTIVE To investigate the effect of meal-related self-monitoring of blood glucose on glycemic control and well-being in non-insulin-treated type 2 diabetic patients . RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS This 6-month study , which included 6 months of follow-up , adopted a prospect i ve , multicenter , r and omized controlled design . Subjects were r and omized to two groups : one group used a blood glucose-monitoring device , kept a blood glucose/eating diary , and received st and ardized counseling ; the control group received nonst and ardized counseling on diet and lifestyle . The primary efficacy parameter was the change in HbA(1c ) . Secondary efficacy variables included changes in body weight , lipids , and microalbumin and changes in treatment satisfaction and well-being . RESULTS In the per- protocol analysis , the use of a self-monitoring blood glucose device significantly reduced HbA(1c ) levels by 1.0 + /- 1.08 % compared with 0.54 + /- 1.41 % for the control group ( P = 0.0086 ) ; subgroup analysis showed three types of responders . Body weight , total cholesterol , and microalbumin improved when using a glucometer , but there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups . Treatment satisfaction increased in both groups to a similar extent ( P = 0.9 ) . Self-monitoring result ed in a marked improvement of general well-being with significant improvements in the subitems depression ( P = 0.032 ) and lack of well-being ( P = 0.02 ) . CONCLUSIONS Meal-related self-monitoring of blood glucose within a structured counseling program improved glycemic control in the majority of non-insulin-treated type 2 diabetic patients in this study . The finding of three types of responders will be important for future planning of counseling and educational interventions', 'Proper r and omisation means little if investigators can not include all r and omised participants in the primary analysis . Participants might ignore follow-up , leave town , or take aspartame when instructed to take aspirin . Exclusions before r and omisation do not bias the treatment comparison , but they can hurt generalisability . Eligibility criteria for a trial should be clear , specific , and applied before r and omisation . Readers should assess whether any of the criteria make the trial sample atypical or unrepresentative of the people in which they are interested . In principle , assessment of exclusions after r and omisation is simple : none are allowed . For the primary analysis , all participants enrolled should be included and analysed as part of the original group assigned ( an intent-to-treat analysis ) . In reality , however , losses frequently occur . Investigators should , therefore , commit adequate re sources to develop and implement procedures to maximise retention of participants . Moreover , research ers should provide clear , explicit information on the progress of all r and omised participants through the trial by use of , for instance , a trial profile . Investigators can also do secondary analyses on , for instance , per- protocol or as-treated participants . Such analyses should be described as secondary and non-r and omised comparisons . Mish and ling of exclusions causes serious method ological difficulties . Unfortunately , some explanations for mish and ling exclusions intuitively appeal to readers , disguising the seriousness of the issues . Creative mismanagement of exclusions can undermine trial validity', \\\"CONTEXT Control of oral anticoagulation therapy has been reported to often be inadequate . Previous retrospective investigations suggest that patients ' self-adjustment of oral anticoagulants may lead to improved control . OBJECTIVE To investigate the effects of patients ' self-management of oral anticoagulation therapy on accuracy of control and measures of treatment-related quality of life . DESIGN R and omized , single-blind , multicenter trial . SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS A total of 179 patients receiving long-term oral anticoagulation treatment were enrolled at 5 referral centers in Germany . INTERVENTION Patients were r and omized to an oral anticoagulation self-management group based on a structured treatment and teaching program and international normalized ratio ( INR ) self-monitoring . The control group received conventional care as provided by family physicians , including referral to specialists if necessary . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Deviation of INR values from the individual INR target range ( squared ) and the 5 categories of treatment-related quality of life . RESULTS Deviation of INR value from the mean of the INR target range was significantly lower in the intervention group at 3-month ( squared INR deviation , 0.59 vs 0.95 ; P<.001 ) and 6-month follow-up ( 0.65 vs 0.83 ; P=.03 ) compared with the control group . Also , the intervention group had INR values within the target range more often ( repeated measurement analysis for categorical data , P=.006 ) . The results were mainly due to less frequent suboptimal INR values in the intervention group ( 32.8 % vs 50.0 % [ P=.03 ] at 3-month , and 33.7 % vs 48.2 % [ P=.08 ] at 6-month follow-up ) . Treatment-related quality -of-life measures , especially treatment satisfaction scores , were significantly higher in the intervention group compared with controls . CONCLUSIONS An anticoagulation education program that includes self-management of anticoagulation therapy results in improved accuracy of anticoagulation control and in treatment-related quality -of-life measures . Further studies are needed to describe whether the program will reduce risk of bleeding or thromboembolism\\\", 'The goal of this study was to compare the relative efficacy and cost of self-monitoring of blood glucose ( SMBG ) with routine urine testing in the management of patients with type II ( non-insulin-dependent ) diabetes mellitus not treated with insulin . Fifty-four patients with type II diabetes mellitus , not treated with insulin , who had inadequate glucose control on diet aloneor diet and oral hypoglycemic agents were studied . Patients performed SMBG or urine glucose testing as part of a st and ardized treatment program that also included diet and exercise counseling . During the 6-mo study , both the urine-testing and SMBG groups showed similar improvement in glycemic control ; within each group , there were significant improvements in fasting plasma glucose ( reduction of 1.4 \\u00b1 3.2 mM , P < 0.03 ) and glycosylated hemoglobin ( reduction of 2.0 \\u00b1 3.4 % , P < 0.01 ) levels . Seventeen ( 31 % ) of54 patients actually normalized their glycosylated hemoglobin values , 9 in the urine-testing group and 8 in the SMBG group . Comparisons between the urine-testing and SMBG groups showed no significant differences in mean fasting plasma glucose ( P > 0.86 ) , glycosylated hemoglobin ( P > 0.95 ) , or weight ( P < 0.19 ) . In patients with type II diabetes mellitus not treated with insulin , SMBG is no more effective , but is 8\\u201312 times more expensive , thanurine testing in facilitating improved glycemic control . Our results do not support widespread use of SMBG in diabetic patients not treated with insulin', 'BACKGROUND Vitamin K antagonist treatment is effective for prevention and treatment of thromboembolic events but frequent laboratory control and dose-adjustment are essential . Small portable devices have enabled patient self-monitoring of anticoagulation and self-adjustment of the dose . We compared this self-management of oral anticoagulant therapy with conventional management by a specialist anticoagulation clinic in a r and omised cross-over study . METHODS 50 patients on long-term oral anticoagulant treatment were included in a r and omised controlled crossover study . Patients were self-managed or were managed by the anticoagulation clinic for a period of 3 months . After this period the alternative strategy was followed for each patient . Prothrombin time ( expressed as international normalised ratio [ INR ] ) were measured at intervals of 1 - 2 weeks in both periods without knowledge of type of management . The primary endpoint was the number of measurements within the therapeutic range ( therapeutic target value + /-50.5 INR units ) . FINDINGS There was no significant difference in the overall quality of control of anticoagulation between the two study periods . Patients were for 55 % and for 49 % of the treatment period within a range of + /-0.5 from the therapeutic target INR during self-management and anticoagulation clinic management , respectively ( p=0.06 ) . The proportion of patients who spent most time in the therapeutic target range was larger during self-management than during anticoagulation clinic-guided management . The odds ratio for a better control of anticoagulation ( defined as the period of time in the therapeutic target range ) during self-management compared with anticoagulation clinic-guided management was 4.6 ( 95 % CI 2.1 - 10.2 ) . A patient-satisfaction assessment showed superiority of self-management over conventional care . INTERPRETATION Self-management of INR in the population in this study is feasible and appears to result in control of anticoagulation that is at least equivalent to management by a specialist anticoagulation clinic . It is also better appreciated by patients . Larger studies are required to assess the effect of this novel management strategy on the incidence of thromboembolic or bleeding complications', 'BACKGROUND Self-management ( SM ) of warfarin by patients is an attractive strategy , particularly if it improves anticoagulation control and can be done safely under minimal physician supervision . OBJECTIVE To compare the effect of SM with physician-management ( PM ) on the maintenance of therapeutic anticoagulation . METHODS A r and omized , open-label eight-month trial was performed . Patients 18 years of age and older were eligible if they were receiving warfarin for at least one month before enrolment and required anticoagulation for at least one year to a target international normalized ratio ( INR ) of 2.0 to 3.0 or 2.5 to 3.5 . Exclusion criteria were a known hypercoaguable disorder , mental incompetence , a language barrier or an inability to attend training sessions . Patients r and omly assigned to SM tested their INR using a point-of-care device ( Pro Time Microcogulation System , International Technidyne Corporation , USA ) and adjusted their warfarin doses using a nomogram . Patients r and omly assigned to PM received usual care from their general practitioner . The primary outcome was to demonstrate 20 % improvement in anticoagulation control by SM . RESULTS One hundred forty patients were r and omly assigned ( 70 per group ) . Thirteen patients dropped out of SM early due to an inability to self-manage . Based on intention-to-treat analysis , there was no difference in the proportion of INR in range ( SM 64.8 % versus PM 58.7 % , P=0.23 ) or time in target range ( SM 71.8 % versus PM 63.2 % , P=0.14 ) . Patients managing their own therapy spent less time below the therapeutic range ( 15.0 % versus 27.3 % , P=0.04 ) . There were three major complications of thrombosis or bleeding , all occurring in the PM arm . All patients who completed SM preferred to continue with that strategy . CONCLUSIONS SM was not significantly better than PM in maintaining therapeutic anticoagulation . SM was feasible and appeared safe in the present study population', \\\"A diabetes protocol characterized by self-monitoring of blood glucose was introduced in four general practice s with the aim of making the frequency of consultations dependent on the metabolic regulation and emphasizing body weight reduction . The feasibility of the programme was investigated and the results after 1 year were compared with those of conventional care in four control practice s. In the experimental practice s , 13 patients switched from a medical specialist 's to a general practitioner 's supervision  , 20 remained under supervision of their GP  and 33 started self-monitoring .  The self-monitoring rate , the consultation frequency according to protocol , the low number of dropouts and inadequate referrals and adherence to the therapeutic scheme showed that the protocol was feasible for both the GPs and the patients . At the initial assessment , the regulation of the diabetes was worse in patients of the experimental group , compared with those of the control group ( mean HbA1 9.7 % vs 8.9 % ; p less than 0.05 ) . On average , patients in the experimental group ( n = 56 ) lost 0.4 kg of body weight , whereas those in the control group ( n = 73 ) gained 0.1 kg ( n.s . ) . The mean change in HbA1 , adjusted for the initial value , was -0.4 % in the experimental and + 0.5 % in the control group ( p less than 0.05 ) . The results of the protocol can be attributed to a combination of greater participation of the patient , the individualized consultation frequency and the prescription of oral hypoglycaemic agents according to body weight development\\\", 'Self-monitoring of blood glucose levels is currently being recommended for obese patients with type II diabetes to improve weight loss and glycemic control . To determine whether self-monitoring of blood glucose levels improves dietary compliance in these patients , 50 obese patients with type II diabetes were r and omly assigned either to a st and ard behavioral weight control program or to a weight control program that included self-monitoring of blood glucose levels and focused on the weight-blood glucose relationship . Both groups lost significant amounts of weight and maintained their losses for at least one year ; reductions in medication could be made for 70 percent of patients . These data suggest that the behavioral weight control used in this study may be of benefit to patients with type II diabetes . However , there was no evidence that the addition of self-monitoring of blood glucose levels to the treatment program improved the outcome in terms of weight loss , reduction in medication , dietary compliance , or mood state', 'The objective of this open , r and omized , multicenter study is to investigate the benefits and economic efficiency of  self-management of oral anticoagulation in patients with atrial fibrillation ( SMAAF study ) in comparison with a group of patients given conventional care by a general practitioner or specialist . Two thous and patients suitable for self-management will be assigned at r and om to either the self-management group or the control group . The numbers of thromboembolic and hemorrhagic complications requiring treatment during the 2-year follow-up period will be recorded as the primary end point . The secondary endpoint variables will be maintenance of the INR value in the individual target range , INR variance , the course of complications over time , and the cost efficiency of self-management compared with the routine procedures . The last of these parameters will include the diagnostic and /or therapeutic measures carried out , the duration of inpatient hospital treatment , and the social consequences ( subsequent rehabilitation treatment , inability to work , forced retirement ) . The estimate of the required number of patients was based on the assumption that during long-term anticoagulant therapy within the framework of primary and secondary prevention 4 % of patients with chronic non-valvular atrial fibrillation would have severe thromboembolic of hemorrhagic complications each year . Since this rate can be halved by self-management , a one-tailed chi 2-test of 80 % power and a 5 % significance threshold would require n = 997 patients per group . The results of the SMAAF study will establish the socioeconomic benefits of self-management in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation', 'BACKGROUND Severe thromboembolic and hemorrhagic complications after mechanical heart valve replacement essentially depend on the intensity of oral anticoagulation and the fluctuation of individual international normalized ratio ( INR ) values . METHODS After heart valve replacement with Medtronic Hall , St. Jude Medical , and CarboMedics implants , patients were r and omly divided into two groups , one controlling INR values at home , the other being monitored by family practitioners . RESULTS Almost 80 % of the INR values recorded by patients at home were within the stipulated therapeutic range , INR 2.5 to 4.5 , compared with just 62 % of INR values recorded by family practitioners . The overall complication rate ( hemorrhages and thromboembolic events ) of the self-management group was significantly ( p < 0.05 ) decreased compared with the conventional group . CONCLUSIONS Through INR self-management , an improvement in the quality of ongoing oral anticoagulation could be shown . Starting this form of therapeutic control early after mechanical heart valve replacement appears to effect a further reduction in anticoagulant-induced complications', 'BACKGROUND Several studies have demonstrated that patient self-management of oral anticoagulant therapy ( OAT )  can improve treatment quality . However , most of these studies were not conducted within a specialized anticoagulation care system . The objective of the present study was to determine whether patient self-management of OAT improves the quality of care delivered by anticoagulation clinics . METHODS In this r and omized study by 2 Dutch anticoagulation clinics 341 patients aged between 18 and 75 years and receiving long-term OAT were divided into 4 groups : an existing routine care group of patients untrained in self-management ; a routine care group of trained patients ; a group managed weekly at an anticoagulation clinic where international normalized ratios were measured by trained patients ; and weekly patient self-management . A 2-step r and omization procedure was followed : first , a Zelen- design r and omization was performed to distribute patients ( without informing them ) to the existing care group or to receive training in self-management ; second , trained patients were r and omized to the 3 other study groups . RESULTS Only 25.6 % of invited patients agreed to participate in the training program . Patients who remained in the existing care group were within the international normalized ratio target range 63.5 % of the time . The type of coumarin taken was a major predicting factor of OAT quality . In all study groups phenprocoumon outperformed acenocoumarol by 11.6 % ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 6.6%-16.5 % ) . Weekly management with phenprocoumon led to a 6.5 % improvement ( 95 % CI , 0.0%-13.1 % ) in time in the international normalized ratio target range when patients were managed at an anticoagulation clinic and to an 8.7 % improvement ( 95 % CI , 1.6%-15.9 % ) when patients were self-managed . Weekly management with acenocoumarol did not improve the quality of OAT . CONCLUSION With selected patients , the quality of OAT obtained through patient self-management is at least as high as that delivered by specialized physicians at anticoagulation clinics . Weekly management of OAT with long-acting phenprocoumon has to be preferred at anticoagulation clinics or , where possible , through patient self-management', 'To study if self-monitoring of glucose , urinary or capillary , could help them to improve their metabolic control through better compliance to diet and /or hypoglycaemic agents , 208 non-insulin-treated poorly controlled diabetic patients were r and omized to : group A -- regular HbA1c determinations but no self-monitoring , group B -- self-urine glucose monitoring , twice every other day , group C -- self blood glucose monitoring , twice every other day , and followed six months . At the end of the study period , the decrease of HbA1c over six months -- main endpoint -- was not significantly different between the three groups ( mean + /- SEM ; group A : -0.5 + /- 0.2 % ; group B : -0.1 + /- 0.3 % ; group C : -0.4 + /- 0.3 % ) . However , the degree of compliance to  blood glucose self-monitoring  in group C appeared to relate to the outcome : a significant correlation was found between the number of blood glucose strips used and the decrease of HbA1c ( r = .36 , p less than .02 ) . We conclude that regular self-monitoring has no definite advantage over the usual management for improving metabolic control in non-insulin-treated diabetic patients , though it may possibly help patients ready to comply with its use', 'Self-monitoring of blood glucose  ( SBGM ) is widely recommended for both type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients despite the lack of evidence of benefit in glucose control or as an aid in weight loss in type 2 subjects . This study tested the hypothesis that combined use of SMBG and dietary carbohydrate ( CHO ) counting , using the blood monitoring results to shape dietary CHO quotas , is beneficial in managing type 2 diabetes . Twenty-three over-weight ( body mass index , BMI 27.5\\u201344 kg/m2 ) patients aged 40\\u201375 participated in a 28-week behavioral weight control program . Baseline hemoglobin HbA 1c ranged between 9.5 % and 13.5 % ( normal range 5.5%\\u20137.7 % ) . Subjects were matched for weight , sex , and HbAlc and assigned to small ( 4\\u20138 participants ) groups which met weekly for 12 weeks and then monthly for 16 weeks . After 8 weeks , the group were r and omized either to continue the behavioral program or to have SMBG and dietary CHO counting .  Glucose monitoring was performed 6 times daily ( pre- and 2h postpr and ially ) for the first month , focusing on the meal increment and correlating this to dietary CHO intake . Weight loss was identical in both groups during the year of follow-up . The HbA1c level showed a progressive decline in experimental subjects ( P<0.05 ) , whereas there was no improvement in control subjects', 'Abstract Objective To determine the clinical effectiveness of self management compared with routine care in patients on long term oral anticoagulants . Design Multicentre open r and omised controlled trial . Setting Midl and s region of the UK . Participants 617 patients aged over 18 and receiving warfarin r and omised to intervention ( n = 337 ) and routine care ( n = from 2470 invited ; 193/337 ( 57 % ) completed the 12 month intervention . Intervention Intervention patients used a point of care device to measure international normalised ratio twice a week and a simple dosing chart to interpret their dose of warfarin . Main outcome measure Percentage of time spent within the therapeutic range of international normalised ratio . Results No significant differences were found in percentage of time in the therapeutic range between self managment and routine care ( 70 % v 68 % ) . Self managed patients with poor control before the study showed an improvement in control that was not seen in the routine care group . Nine patients ( 2.8/100 patient years ) had serious adverse events in the self managed group , compared with seven ( 2.7/100 patient years ) in the routine care arm ( \\u03c72(df = 1 ) = 0.02 , P = 0.89 ) . Conclusion With appropriate training , self management is safe and reliable for a sizeable proportion of patients receiving oral anticoagulation treatment . It may improve the time spent the therapeutic range for patients with initially poor control . Trial registration IS RCT N 19313375', 'This study tested the hypothesis that follow-up intervention ( by telephone calls and home visit ) affects compliance in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus ( NIDDM ) . Sixty NIDDM patients were r and omly assigned to two groups \\u2014 a control group , which received the st and ard protocol ( 3-day educational program and a review session 1 month after the program ) ; and an intervention group , which received the st and ard protocol as well as a series offour telephone calls and one home visit by a registered nurse over a 3-month period .  Compliance to prescribed regimens was determined by analyzing three sets of data : changes in pre- to post study glycosylated hemoglobin ( HbA1c ) values ; changes in pre- to post study weight ; and frequency with which self-monitoring of blood glucose ( SMBG ) was practice d. Results showed that SMBG practice was significantly better for the intervention group . No significant differences were seen in post study HbA 1c values and weight changes between the two groups . Follow-up inter vention by telephone calls and home visit can enhance patient compliance to certain aspects of the prescribed diabetes management plan', 'STUDY OBJECTIVE To evaluate the efficacy and accuracy of monitoring prothrombin times at home . DESIGN R and omized , prospect i ve cohort study . SETTING Out patients discharged from a university hospital or a community hospital . PATIENTS Fifty patients started on warfarin for the first time who demonstrated an ability to use the monitor and who had not achieved a stable response to warfarin in the hospital . INTERVENTION Oral anticoagulation therapy managed using a portable prothrombin time monitor compared with specialized anticoagulation clinic care . MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS In the 46 patients who completed the 8-week study , the median percentage of time that patients in the home-monitor group ( n = 23 ) were within a range equal to the target prothrombin ratio + /- 0.3 , but always above 1.25 , was 93 % , compared with 75 % for patients in the clinic group ( n = 23 ) ( P = 0.003 ) . There was no significant difference between groups in the percentage of time above the therapeutic range ; however , the percentage of time that patients were subtherapeutic was significantly greater in the clinic group ( P less than 0.001 ) . There were no major thromboembolic or hemorrhagic complications in either group . Differences between home monitor measurements and corresponding clinical laboratory measurements using blood sample s drawn within 4 hours of the home test were comparable to differences observed between measurements using two different clinical laboratory instruments . CONCLUSIONS Use of a portable prothrombin time monitor by patients at home is feasible and provides accurate measurements . Patients doing home monitoring achieve superior anticoagulation control compared with those receiving st and ard anticoagulation clinic care', \\\"Context Although many out patients require oral anticoagulation , the optimal management of outpatient anticoagulation remains uncertain . Studies have demonstrated the feasibility of patient self-management using portable coagulometers , but the studies that compared patient outcomes with self-management and those with conventional management in an anticoagulation clinic did not find a better outcome with self-management . Contribution In this r and omized , controlled trial of 737 patients , patients assigned to self-management of anticoagulation achieved a similar level of control and had fewer adverse events than patients assigned to conventional management . Implication s Health care providers should begin to implement patient self-management of oral anticoagulation with portable coagulometers in mainstream practice . The Editors Indications for oral anticoagulant treatment to prevent thromboembolic disease have increased in recent years ( 1 ) . Prothrombin times must be monitored frequently in patients taking oral anticoagulants to determine the safest dose and to minimize the risk for complications . The clinical management of oral anticoagulant treatment improved greatly after the international normalized ratio ( INR ) was introduced as a measurement of anticoagulation intensity ( 1 ) . The establishment of accurate therapeutic INR ranges was also beneficial . Target ranges include the safest INR values that carry the lowest risk for hemorrhagic or thromboembolic complications ( 2 ) . Despite these improvements , however , serious complications are still associated with oral anticoagulant treatment ( 3 , 4 ) , and management by specialized staff at anticoagulation clinics seems to be safer than other clinical strategies in terms of numbers of complications ( 5 - 7 ) . Currently , portable coagulometers are available for determining INR easily and reliably ( 8) . This technology provides interesting clinical models for the control of oral anticoagulant treatment , the most promising of which are patient self-testing and patient self-management . For patient self-testing , patients measure INRs themselves and ask their referring physicians for the proper anticoagulant dose . Patient self-management assumes that patients will adjust their own doses and is the most autonomous strategy . Several published studies have compared these strategies with usual care ( that is , monitoring of oral anticoagulant treatment by practitioners ) ( 9 - 13 ) or with specialized anticoagulation clinics ( 14 - 18 ) . Although these studies showed that both patient self-testing and patient self-management are feasible , their sample s were relatively small ( 9 , 11 , 13 , 14 - 18 ) or included selected patients with mechanical valve prostheses ( 10 ) or patients older than 65 years of age ( 12 ) . In general , previous studies indicate that patient self-management may be superior to management by general practitioners or anticoagulation clinics in quality of INR control ( 10 - 18 ) . In addition , Krtke and Krfer ( 10 ) , Beyth and associates ( 12 ) , and Sawicki ( 13 ) reported a decrease in major complications among self-managed patients compared with patients managed by general practitioners . To date , no published data have suggested a better clinical outcome ( decrease in associated complications ) with patient self-management than with specialized management at an anticoagulation clinic ( 5 , 19 ) . We performed a r and omized , controlled trial to directly compare self-management of oral anticoagulant treatment , as evaluated in terms of efficacy and safety in unselected patients , with management in an anticoagulation clinic . Methods Study Design The Alternative Control of Oral Anticoagulant Treatment ( ACOA ) trial is a single-center , central ly r and omized , controlled study that was performed at Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau , Barcelona , Spain , from January 2001 to July 2002 . The hematologists who manage our anticoagulation clinic use a homogeneous dosing protocol and st and ard protocol s to manage situations that increase clinical risk . The clinical staff includes trained nurses . Computers control the clinical data and INR records , ensuring excellent follow-up . Patients and their relatives receive basic education at the beginning of oral anticoagulant treatment , including information on the main characteristics of oral anticoagulants , potential risks , rationale for periodic monitoring , and drug interactions . Samsa and Matchar ( 20 ) recommended that these characteristics be used to provide an appropriate control group in a trial on patient self-management . The institutional review board of our hospital approved the study . Recruitment Phase The recruitment phase began with computerized r and om selection of 1500 patients from the more than 5000 who were receiving oral anticoagulant treatment controlled in our hospital . We included any ambulatory patient 18 years of age or older who had been receiving long-term anticoagulant therapy for at least 3 months before entering the study . We excluded patients who were younger than 18 years of age , who had a severe physical or mental illness without a responsible caregiver , or who were of foreign origin and were unable to underst and Spanish . Once the patient ( or his or her caregiver ) agreed to participate , written informed consent was obtained . Next , central ized telephone r and omization assigned the patient to the experimental group ( patient self-management ) or to the control group ( conventional management ) . The allocation sequence was generated at the hospital 's epidemiology department , and the sequence of r and omization was concealed until the patient was assigned to a group . To facilitate comparability between study groups , this r and omization was stratified according to sex , age ( 70 years of age or < 70 years of age ) , and indication for oral anticoagulant treatment ( 4 groups ) . Members of our anticoagulation clinic enrolled participants and assigned them to groups . Baseline data included demographic details , clinical information on associated risk factors , other medications , previous length of anticoagulant therapy , bleeding or thromboembolic complications during oral anticoagulant treatment , and target INR range . Follow-up for patients assigned to the conventional management group was done immediately . Patients in the self-management group received a training course first , and follow-up was not performed until the nurse teaching the course judged that the patients had acquired a minimum of expertise in self-management . Training Course An educational program was design ed to optimize the number of patients able to underst and and safely perform  self-management  ( Appendix ) . It was similar to the German program developed by Sawicki ( 13 ) but was demographically adapted to the characteristics of the Spanish population , considering differences in daily schedules , diet , educational level , and other idiosyncratic factors . The program consisted of 2 sessions of 2 hours each on consecutive days . A specially trained nurse was responsible for teaching the patients in small , organized groups . The lessons included basic theoretical and practical concepts involving the use of a coagulometer , interpretation of INR , and adjustment of dose . The concepts of target range and dose modification were emphasized when necessary . A simple card system was design ed to help the patient select the correct dose . For each target range , a specific card was provided . Patients were taught to use the portable coagulometer CoaguChek S ( Roche Diagnostics , Mannheim , Germany ) with the appropriate reagent strips . Follow-up Phase Normally , the patients in the conventional management group visited our hospital every 4 weeks to check their INRs . When the INR result was out of target range , our dosing protocol indicated that we should advance the next appointment for INR testing to 1 or 2 weeks . International normalized ratio was determined by means of a st and ard KC 10 coagulometer ( Amelung , Lemgo , Germany ) . As a thromboplastin , we used Thromborel S ( Behring , Marburg , Germany ) . A hematologist experienced in oral anticoagulation management adjusted the dose and made the appointment for the next INR test . Patients in the self-management group performed the INR tests at home once per week using the CoaguChek S kit . They determined the appropriate dose of oral anticoagulant and the time of the next INR test . All of the INR results in both groups were entered into a computer ( in the central system of our anticoagulation clinic or in the portable coagulometers ) to facilitate data management . Patients in both groups were interviewed monthly by telephone to record any complications or changes in their health status . For the conventional management group , these interviews were done approximately midway between hospital visits . The questions addressed minor or major bleeding , thromboembolic events , episodic diseases , changes in long-term medications , and hospital stays . Associated complications were diagnosed and evaluated by a third physician who was not involved in the trial and was unaware of patients ' study group . St and ard criteria were used to diagnose any thromboembolic complications . Transient ischemic attack was diagnosed clinical ly by a neurologist , and superficial thrombophlebitis was diagnosed clinical ly by an angiologist . To diagnose stroke , arterial embolism , venous thromboembolism , pulmonary embolism , or valve thrombosis , we used widely accepted methods ( computed tomography or magnetic nuclear resonance imaging , angiography , surgical diagnosis , Doppler ultrasonography , phlebography , lung angiography or ventilation-perfusion lung scanning , cardiac ultrasonography , or fluoroscopy ) . All thromboembolic complications were considered major events . Life-threatening bleeding or bleeding requiring transfusion or hospital admission was considered a major event . Any other bleeding was considered a minor event . Statistical Analysis Study outcomes were evaluated on an intention-to-treat basis and also on an on-treatment basis .\\\", 'Of 125 patients aged 65 years or over , with atrial fibrillation taking warfarin for at least 12 months , with a st and ard deviation ( SD ) of prothrombin time , expressed as the International Normalized Ratio ( INR ) > 0\\u00b75 over the previous 6 months , 40 were r and omized to continue with usual clinic care and 85 to receive education about warfarin .  Of these , 44 were r and omized to self\\u2010monitor their INR and 41 returned to clinic . Compared with the previous 6 months there was a significant increase in percentage time within the therapeutic range for the 6 months following education [ 61\\u00b71 vs. 70\\u00b74 ; mean difference 8\\u00b78 ; 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) : \\u22120\\u00b72\\u201317\\u00b78 ; P = 0\\u00b7054 ] and following education and self\\u2010monitoring ( 57 vs. 71\\u00b71 ; mean difference 14\\u00b71 ; 95 % CI : 6\\u00b77\\u201321\\u00b75 ; P < 0\\u00b7001 ) , compared with those patients following usual clinic care ( 60\\u00b70 vs. 63\\u00b72 ; mean difference 3\\u00b72 ; 95 % CI : \\u22127\\u00b73\\u201313\\u00b77 ) . Using the same comparative periods , the INR SD fell by 0\\u00b724 ( P < 0\\u00b70001 ) in the group allocated to education and self\\u2010monitoring , 0\\u00b726 ( P < 0\\u00b70001 ) in the group receiving education alone and 0\\u00b716 ( P = 0\\u00b7003 ) in the control group . Inter\\u2010group differences were not statistically significant ( intervention groups 0\\u00b726 \\u00b1 0\\u00b730 vs. control 0\\u00b716 \\u00b1 0\\u00b73 , P = 0\\u00b710 ) . Quality \\u2010of\\u2010life measurements and health beliefs about warfarin were unchanged ( apart from emotional role limitation ) with education or education and self\\u2010monitoring .  Patient  education regarding anticoagulation therapy could be a cost\\u2010effective initiative and is worthy of further study', 'BACKGROUND This study was conducted to assess the ability of patients receiving heart valve replacements to practice self-managed anticoagulation using a portable coagulometer . METHODS We carried out a prospect i ve , r and omized trial , comparing self-managed anticoagulation with conventional management .  Patients practicing self-managed anticoagulation ( 51 patients ) did so at home , measuring their international normalized ratio and then deciding on their dosage of warfarin , while  conventionally controlled patients ( n = 49 ) attended hospital clinics or were managed by their family physicians . RESULTS We successfully trained 41 of 44 patients who agreed to self-manage their anticoagulant therapy ; 34 of the 41 managed their own anticoagulation at home for 2 years . Their control , assessed by a number of tests in range ( 67.6 % versus 58.0 % ) and time in therapeutic range ( 76.5 % versus 63.8 % ) , was significantly better than that for the group managed conventionally ( p < 0.0001 ) . There was no significant difference in mortality or morbidity between the two groups . CONCLUSIONS Self-managed anticoagulation is a reliable , easily learned method of controlling anticoagulation , and it is suitable for approximately two thirds of patients , with excellent results', \\\"Bleeding is the major side effect of warfarin and is a major deterrent to its use , especially in older patients . Older people are widely thought to be at increased risk for warfarin-related bleeding ( 1 - 8 ) , and they are less likely to be treated with warfarin , even when it has been proven efficacious , in part because of concern about risk for bleeding ( 9 - 13 ) . Efforts that reduce the frequency of major warfarin-related bleeding not only will increase the net benefit of therapy but also will facilitate more appropriate and widespread use of warfarin therapy in older patients . Methods for identifying patients at highest risk for bleeding have recently advanced ( 5 - 7 , 14 - 21 ) , and experience with specialized programs that coordinate the management of anticoagulant therapy suggests that clinical outcomes may be improved ( 6 , 14 , 18 , 22 - 27 ) . However , there is little controlled or experimental evidence on how to optimize management of anticoagulant therapy in older patients and prevent bleeding . We developed a multicomponent comprehensive program for management of warfarin therapy aim ed at improving control of the anticoagulant effect and reducing events ( such as use of an interacting medicine ) that might precipitate bleeding . We hypothesized that this intervention would be acceptable to most elderly persons starting warfarin therapy and would reduce the frequency of warfarin-related major bleeding . Methods Patients Patients hospitalized at University Hospitals of Clevel and , a 900-bed teaching hospital , between September 1992 and October 1995 who were 65 years of age or older and were receiving 10 000 units or more of intravenous unfractionated heparin every 24 hours were screened daily . Of these patients , we identified 426 persons who were 65 years of age or older , who resided in Cuyahoga County , Ohio , and for whom treatment with warfarin was planned for 10 or more days ( Figure 1 ) . Patients were excluded if they had been treated with warfarin at any time during the previous 6 months , were admitted from a nursing home , were enrolled in another clinical trial , were too ill to give consent and had no available surrogate , were discharged prematurely , or did not speak English ; if their private physician refused to participate ; or if no r and om allocation was taking place ( for example , during vacations or holidays ) . Eligible patients who were enrolled did not differ significantly from those who were not enrolled with regard to age , ethnicity , sex , or indication for therapy . Figure 1 . Eligibility and r and om assignment of patients . Patients were stratified according to their baseline risk for major bleeding by using the Outpatient Bleeding Risk Index ( 20 ) . This index includes four independent risk factors for  major bleeding :  age 65 years or older , history of gastrointestinal bleeding , history of stroke , and one or more of four specific comorbid conditions ( recent myocardial infa rct ion , hematocrit<30 % , creatinine concentration>133 mol/L [ 1.5 mg/dL ] , or diabetes mellitus ) . Patients with one or two risk factors were classified as intermediate risk , and those with three or more risk factors were classified as high risk ; estimated frequencies of major bleeding in 6 months were 6 % and 35 % , respectively . After stratification , patients were r and omly assigned to receive usual care or intervention . Informed consent for observation and data collection was then sought from both groups , and informed consent to participate in the intervention was sought from the intervention group . This method , initially proposed by Zelen ( 28 ) , allows the study to test the effectiveness of offering the intervention rather than simply the efficacy of the intervention in patients who consent to participation before r and om assignment . The sample size was calculated to provide 80 % power and an level of 0.05 . The study protocol and informed consent procedures were approved by the hospital 's institutional review board . Intervention The intervention had two main components . The first component consisted of a guideline -based consultation that assessed the patient 's indications for therapy and potential risk factors for warfarin-related bleeding .  We used this method previously to reduce the frequency of anticoagulant-related bleeding  during hospitalization ( 27 ) . Specific recommendations about modifiable risk factors , such as use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs , were made and implemented . The study investigators directed warfarin dosing and international normalized ratio ( INR ) testing after hospital discharge . The second component included patient education , coaching , and self-monitoring of prothrombin time ;  this component was grounded in social learning theory ( 29 - 31 ) and experimental evidence ( 32 , 33 ) showing that increasing participation of patients in their care can improve clinical outcomes but that increasing patient knowledge alone is insufficient ( 34 , 35 ) . Patient education consisted of one-on-one teaching by a lay educator using a specifically formatted workbook for older adults to teach them about warfarin , indications for its use , drug and food interactions , and the signs and symptoms of bleeding . The lay educator review ed the workbook and was taught how to use the prothrombin time monitor by one of the authors but had no formal medical training . Coaching was aim ed to increase patients ' participation in their care and to improve information-seeking skills . Patients were trained and encouraged to communicate more effectively with physicians and other health personnel about a range of issues , such as health concerns , drug interactions , or changes in lifestyle or diet . Finally , patients were taught to self-monitor the  prothrombin time by using a home portable monitor ( Coumatrak Protime Test System , Biotrack , Inc. , Mountain View , California ) . The monitor uses a fingerstick to obtain a blood sample and has well-established accuracy ( 36 - 38 ) . Patients were initially assessed , educated , and taught to use the portable monitor while hospitalized ; training lasted 30 minutes to 1 hour . They were seen daily while hospitalized , warfarin therapy was adjusted as needed , and any concerns or questions about anticoagulant therapy were addressed . Within 3 days of discharge from the hospital , the lay educator or study investigator made a home visit to assess patients ' use of the portable monitor and to check the  prothrombin time .  In general , patients were instructed to check their prothrombin time three times during the first week after hospital discharge , weekly for the remainder of the first month , and monthly thereafter depending on their results . Patients phoned in their results to the coach , who review ed the results with one of the investigators and provided same-day follow-up , including recommendations for dose and subsequent INR testing . Patients were instructed to call whenever they had questions or concerns about their  warfarin management or possible side effects , if they were hospitalized for any reason , or if they began receiving new medications . After the 6-month intervention period , management and dosing of warfarin therapy reverted back to patients ' personal physicians . Patients assigned to usual care received medical care , including management , dosing , and medical information , according to the discretion and practice s of their personal physician . Data Collection Trained abstract ors who were not involved with the intervention component of the study collected data from the medical chart at the start of anticoagulant therapy ; at each subsequent hospitalization ; and by blinded interview at enrollment and 1 , 3 , and 6 months after enrollment and every 6 months thereafter . Data elements included demographic characteristics , clinical history including comorbid diagnoses , indications for therapy , potential risk factors for bleeding , functional status , and new illnesses or comorbid conditions that developed after enrollment . Surveillance for bleeding and thromboembolism was conducted identically in the intervention and control groups and consisted of 12 items inquiring about bleeding and thromboembolism at each follow-up interview . Whenever an event was reported , the clinical characteristics of the bleeding or thromboembolic episode were determined by review of the relevant medical record and abstract ed without identifying patient information onto a st and ard form . All date s of death were confirmed by death certificates , and all causes of death were confirmed by review of death certificates and medical records . Follow-up was complete for all patients . End Points The primary end point was the first major bleeding event during the 6-month intervention period . Using explicit criteria in the Bleeding Severity Index ( 39 ) for the amount , rate , and consequences of bleeding , we defined major bleeding as overt bleeding that led to the loss of at least 2.0 units of blood in 7 days or less or was otherwise life-threatening ( for example , intracranial bleeding ) . Bleeding was classified without information about possible risk factors or r and omization status . Two author- review ers who were blinded to group assignment adjudicated bleeding events ; their agreement was high ( statistic , 0.97 ) . Secondary outcomes were death and recurrent venous thromboembolism at 6 months ; major bleeding after 6 months ; and control of anticoagulant therapy during the first 6 months of therapy , as measured by the INR . The therapeutic range of the INR was defined as 2.5 to 3.5 for persons with mechanical heart valves and 2.0 to 3.0 for persons with all other indications ( 40 ) . Therapeutic quality control was assessed by using the patient-time approach , described by Rosendaal and colleagues ( 41 ) , for three time periods after discharge from the hospital : 0 to 1 month , 1 to 3 months , and 3 to 6 months of therapy . This approach estimates the amount of time a patient is in the therapeutic range based on the actual INRs measured , assuming a linear relationship between consecutive INRs . Patients with only one\\\", \\\"An ageing population and the continuing expansion of clinical indications for coumadin therapy have increased pressure on hospital anticoagulant clinics . One solution is patient self\\u2010testing ( PST ) of the international normalized ratio ( INR ) using capillary blood sample s on point\\u2010of\\u2010care coagulation monitors at home . We conducted a prospect i ve study to determine whether patients can achieve accurate INR values through PST , using the CoaguChek S ( Roche Diagnostics , Lewes , UK ) . The main outcome measurements were : comparability of INR values obtained by PST and the hospital laboratory , patient acceptability as assessed by a question naire and anticoagulant control . Eighty\\u2010four patients [ 53 men , 31 women ; median age 59 years ( range 26\\u201383 ) ] , receiving long\\u2010term oral anticoagulation ( warfarin ) , were recruited from our Anticoagulation Clinic . Patients were r and omized to weekly self\\u2010testing or continuing 4\\u2010weekly hospital laboratory monitoring of INR . Comparison of INRs ( n = 234 ) showed no significant differences between the CoaguChek ( median INR 3\\u00b702 ) and laboratory testing ( median INR 3\\u00b707 ) . There was excellent correlation between the two methods ( r = 0\\u00b795 ) , with 85 % of CoaguChek results within 0\\u00b75 INR units of the laboratory method . On four occasions , differences of > 1 unit INR were obtained , but in each case the patient 's anticoagulation was unstable ( INR > 4\\u00b75 by both methods ) and the differences in INR would not have altered patient management . 87 % of patients found self\\u2010testing straightforward , 87 % were confident in the result they obtained and 77 % preferred self\\u2010testing . We conclude that PST is a reliable alternative to hospital clinic attendance and is acceptable to the majority of suitably trained patients\\\"]\",\n          \"['BACKGROUND Actinic keratosis is a common precursor to sun-related squamous-cell carcinoma . Treating actinic keratoses and the surrounding skin area ( i.e. , field therapy ) can eradicate clinical and sub clinical actinic keratoses . Topical field therapy currently requires weeks or months of treatment . We investigated the efficacy and safety of a new topical field therapy for actinic keratosis , ingenol mebutate gel ( 0.015 % for face and scalp and 0.05 % for trunk and extremities ) . METHODS In four multicenter , r and omized , double-blind studies , we r and omly assigned patients with actinic keratoses on the face or scalp or on the trunk or extremities to receive ingenol mebutate or placebo ( vehicle ) , self-applied to a 25-cm(2 ) contiguous field once daily for 3 consecutive days for lesions on the face or scalp or for 2 consecutive days for the trunk or extremities . Complete clearance ( primary outcome ) was assessed at 57 days , and local reactions were quantitatively measured . RESULTS In a pooled analysis of the two trials involving the face and scalp , the rate of complete clearance was higher with ingenol mebutate than with placebo ( 42.2 % vs. 3.7 % , P<0.001 ) . Local reactions peaked at day 4 , with a mean maximum composite score of 9.1 on the local-skin-response scale ( which ranges from 0 to 4 for six types of reaction , yielding a composite score of 0 to 24 , with higher numbers indicating more severe reactions ) , rapidly decreased by day 8 , and continued to decrease , approaching baseline scores by day 29 . In a pooled analysis of the two trials involving the trunk and extremities , the rate of complete clearance was also higher with ingenol mebutate than with placebo ( 34.1 % vs. 4.7 % , P<0.001 ) . Local skin reactions peaked between days 3 and 8 and declined rapidly , approaching baseline by day 29 , with a mean maximum score of 6.8 . Adverse events were generally mild to moderate in intensity and resolved without sequelae . CONCLUSIONS Ingenol mebutate gel applied topically for 2 to 3 days is effective for field treatment of actinic keratoses .

However , the duration of the benefit is unknown , as are the effects specific to age and sex . METHODS In the Minnesota Colon Cancer Control Study , 46,551 participants , 50 to 80 years of age , were r and omly assigned to usual care ( control ) or to annual or biennial screening with fecal occult-blood testing . Screening was performed from 1976 through 1982 and from 1986 through 1992 . We used the National Death Index to obtain up date d information on the vital status of participants and to determine causes of death through 2008 . RESULTS Through 30 years of follow-up , 33,020 participants ( 70.9 % ) died . A total of 732 deaths were attributed to colorectal cancer : 200 of the 11,072 deaths ( 1.8 % ) in the annual-screening group , 237 of the 11,004 deaths ( 2.2 % ) in the biennial-screening group , and 295 of the 10,944 deaths ( 2.7 % ) in the control group . Screening reduced colorectal-cancer mortality ( relative risk with annual screening , 0.68 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.56 to 0.82 ; relative risk with biennial screening , 0.78 ; 95 % CI , 0.65 to 0.93 ) through 30 years of follow-up . No reduction was observed in all-cause mortality ( relative risk with annual screening , 1.00 ; 95 % CI , 0.99 to 1.01 ; relative risk with biennial screening , 0.99 ; 95 % CI , 0.98 to 1.01 ) . The reduction in colorectal-cancer mortality was larger for men than for women in the biennial-screening group ( P=0.04 for interaction ) . CONCLUSIONS The effect of screening with fecal occult-blood testing on colorectal-cancer mortality persists after 30 years but does not influence all-cause mortality . The sustained reduction in colorectal-cancer mortality supports the effect of polypectomy .

We assessed their effects on mortality and breastfeeding rates  in rural Malawi . METHODS We did a 2 \\u00d7 2 factorial , cluster-r and omised trial in 185,888 people in Mchinji district . 48 equal-sized clusters were r and omly allocated to four groups with a computer-generated number sequence . 24 facilitators guided groups through a community action cycle to tackle maternal and child health problems . 72 trained volunteer peer counsellors  made home visits at five timepoints during pregnancy and after birth to support breastfeeding and infant care . Primary outcomes for the women 's group intervention were maternal , perinatal , neonatal , and infant mortality rates ( MMR , PMR , NMR , and IMR , respectively ) ; and for the peer counselling were IMR and exclusive breastfeeding ( EBF ) rates . Analysis was by intention to treat . The trial is registered as IS RCT N06477126 . FINDINGS We monitored outcomes of 26,262 births between 2005 and 2009 . In a factorial model adjusted only for clustering and the volunteer peer counselling intervention , in women 's group areas , for years 2 and 3 , we noted non-significant decreases in NMR ( odds ratio 0.93 , 0.64 - 1.35 ) and MMR ( 0.54 , 0.28 - 1.04 ) . After adjustment for parity , socioeconomic quintile , and baseline measures , effects were larger for NMR ( 0.85 , 0.59 - 1.22 ) and MMR ( 0.48 , 0.26 - 0.91 ) . Because of the interaction between the two interventions , a stratified analysis was done . For women 's groups , in adjusted analyses , MMR fell by 74 % ( 0.26 , 0.10 - 0.70 ) , and NMR by 41 % ( 0.59 , 0.40 - 0.86 ) in areas with no peer counsellors , but there was no effect in areas with counsellors ( 1.09 , 0.40 - 2.98 , and 1.38 , 0.75 - 2.54 ) . Factorial analysis for the peer counselling intervention for years 1 - 3 showed a fall in IMR of 18 % ( 0.82 , 0.67 - 1.00 ) and an improvement in EBF rates ( 2.42 , 1.48 - 3.96 ) . The results of the stratified , adjusted analysis showed a 36 % reduction in IMR ( 0.64 , 0.48 - 0.85 ) but no effect on EBF ( 1.18 , 0.63 - 2.25 ) in areas without women 's groups , and in areas with women 's groups there was no effect on IMR ( 1.05 , 0.82 - 1.36 ) and an increase in EBF ( 5.02 , 2.67 - 9.44 ) . The cost of women 's groups was US$ 114 per year of life lost ( YLL ) averted and that of peer counsellors was $ 33 per YLL averted , using stratified data from single intervention comparisons .

FUNDING Saving Newborn Lives , UK Department for International Development , and Wellcome Trust\\\", 'BACKGROUND Venous thromboembolism is a common , potentially avoidable cause of death and morbidity in patients in hospital , including those with stroke . In surgical patients , intermittent pneumatic compression ( IPC ) reduces the risk of deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ) , but no reliable evidence exists about its effectiveness in patients who have had a stroke . We assessed the effectiveness of IPC to reduce the risk of DVT in patients who have had a stroke . METHODS The CLOTS 3 trial is a multicentre parallel group r and omised trial assessing IPC in immobile patients ( ie , who can not walk to the toilet without the help of another person ) with acute stroke . We enrolled patients from day 0 to day 3 of admission and allocated them via a central r and omisation system ( ratio 1:1 ) to receive either IPC or no IPC . A technician who was masked to treatment allocation did a compression duplex ultrasound ( CDU ) of both legs at 7 - 10 days and , wherever practical , at 25 - 30 days after enrolment . Caregivers and patients were not masked to treatment assignment . Patients were followed up for 6 months to determine survival and later symptomatic venous thromboembolism . The primary outcome was a DVT in the proximal veins detected on a screening CDU or any symptomatic DVT in the proximal veins , confirmed on imaging , within 30 days of r and omisation . Patients were analysed according to their treatment allocation . TRIAL REGISTRATION IS RCT N93529999 . FINDINGS Between Dec 8 , 2008 , and Sept 6 , 2012 , 2876 patients were enrolled in 94 centres in the UK . The included patients were broadly representative of immobile stroke patients admitted to hospital and had a median age of 76 years ( IQR 67 - 84 ) . The primary outcome occurred in 122 ( 8\\u00b75 % ) of 1438 patients allocated IPC and 174 ( 12\\u00b71 % ) of 1438 patients allocated no IPC ; an absolute reduction in risk of 3\\u00b76 % ( 95 % CI 1\\u00b74 - 5\\u00b78 ) . Excluding the 323 patients who died before any primary outcome and 41 without any screening CDU , the adjusted OR for the comparison of 122 of 1267 patients vs 174 of 1245 patients was 0\\u00b765 ( 95 % CI 0\\u00b751 - 0\\u00b784 ; p=0\\u00b7001 ) . Deaths in the treatment period occurred in 156 ( 11 % ) patients allocated IPC and 189 ( 13 % ) patients allocated no IPC died within the 30 days of treatment period ( p=0\\u00b7057 ) ; skin breaks on the legs were reported in 44 ( 3 % ) patients allocated IPC and in 20 ( 1 % ) patients allocated no IPC ( p=0\\u00b7002 ) ; falls with injury were reported in 33 ( 2 % ) patients in the IPC group and in 24 ( 2 % ) patients in the no-IPC group ( p=0\\u00b7221 ) .

However , the timing for the initiation of ART during tuberculosis treatment remains unresolved . METHODS We conducted a three-group , open-label , r and omized , controlled trial in South Africa involving 642 ambulatory patients , all with tuberculosis ( confirmed by a positive sputum smear for acid-fast bacilli ) , human immunodeficiency virus infection , and a CD4 + T-cell count of less than 500 per cubic millimeter . Findings in the earlier-ART group ( ART initiated within 4 weeks after the start of tuberculosis treatment ,  214 patients ) and later-ART group ( ART initiated during the first 4 weeks of the continuation phase of tuberculosis treatment ,  215 patients ) are presented here . RESULTS At baseline , the median CD4 + T-cell count was 150 per cubic millimeter , and the median viral load was 161,000 copies per milliliter , with no significant differences between the two groups . The incidence rate of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) or death was 6.9 cases per 100 person-years in the earlier-ART group ( 18 cases ) as compared with 7.8 per 100 person-years in the later-ART group ( 19 cases ) ( incidence-rate ratio , 0.89 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.44 to 1.79 ; P=0.73 ) . However , among patients with CD4 + T-cell counts of less than 50 per cubic millimeter , the incidence rates of AIDS or death were 8.5 and 26.3 cases per 100 person-years , respectively ( incidence-rate ratio , 0.32 ; 95 % CI , 0.07 to 1.13 ; P=0.06 ) . The incidence rates of the immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome ( IRIS ) were 20.1 and 7.7 cases per 100 person-years , respectively ( incidence-rate ratio , 2.62 ; 95 % CI , 1.48 to 4.82 ; P<0.001 ) . Adverse events requiring a switching of antiretroviral drugs occurred in 10 patients in the earlier-ART group and 1 patient in the later-ART group ( P=0.006 ) . CONCLUSIONS Early initiation of ART in patients with CD4 + T-cell counts of less than 50 per cubic millimeter increased AIDS-free survival . Deferral of the initiation of ART to the first 4 weeks of the continuation phase of tuberculosis therapy in those with higher CD4 + T-cell counts reduced the risks of IRIS and other adverse events related to ART without increasing the risk of AIDS or death .

For faster and more reliable administration , paramedics increasingly use an intramuscular route . METHODS This double-blind , r and omized , noninferiority trial compared the efficacy of intramuscular midazolam with that of intravenous lorazepam for children and adults in status epilepticus treated by paramedics . Subjects whose convulsions had persisted for more than 5 minutes and who were still convulsing after paramedics arrived were given the study medication by either intramuscular autoinjector or intravenous infusion . The primary outcome was absence of seizures at the time of arrival in the emergency department without the need for rescue therapy . Secondary outcomes included endotracheal intubation , recurrent seizures , and timing of treatment relative to the cessation of convulsive seizures . This trial tested the hypothesis that intramuscular midazolam was noninferior to intravenous lorazepam by a margin of 10 percentage points . RESULTS At the time of arrival in the emergency department , seizures were absent without rescue therapy in 329 of 448 subjects ( 73.4 % ) in the intramuscular-midazolam group and in 282 of 445 ( 63.4 % ) in the intravenous-lorazepam group ( absolute difference , 10 percentage points ; 95 % confidence interval , 4.0 to 16.1 ; P<0.001 for both noninferiority and superiority ) . The two treatment groups were similar with respect to need for endotracheal intubation ( 14.1 % of subjects with intramuscular midazolam and 14.4 % with intravenous lorazepam ) and recurrence of seizures ( 11.4 % and 10.6 % , respectively ) . Among subjects whose seizures ceased before arrival in the emergency department , the median times to active treatment were 1.2 minutes in the intramuscular-midazolam group and 4.8 minutes in the intravenous-lorazepam group , with corresponding median times from active treatment to cessation of convulsions of 3.3 minutes and 1.6 minutes . Adverse-event rates were similar in the two groups . CONCLUSIONS For subjects in status epilepticus , intramuscular midazolam is at least as safe and effective as intravenous lorazepam for prehospital seizure cessation .

METHODS We undertook a multicentre , open-label r and omised controlled trial in 40 hospitals in the Netherl and s. We r and omly assigned women with a multiple pregnancy between 12 and 20 weeks ' gestation ( 1:1 ) to pessary or control groups  , using a web-based application with a computer-generated list with r and om block sizes of two to four , stratified by hospital . Participants and investigators were aware of group allocation . For women in the pessary group , a midwife or obstetrician inserted a cervical pessary between 16 and 20 weeks ' gestation . Women in the control group did not receive the pessary , but otherwise received similar obstetrical care to those in the pessary group . The primary outcome was a composite of poor perinatal outcome : stillbirth , periventricular leucomalacia , severe respiratory distress syndrome , bronchopulmonary dysplasia , intraventricular haemorrhage , necrotising enterocolitis , proven sepsis , and neonatal death . Analyses were by modified intention to treat . This trial is registered in the Dutch trial registry , number NTR1858 .

FUNDING The Netherl and s Organisation for Health Research and Development\\\", 'BACKGROUND Treatment with prasugrel and aspirin improves outcomes compared with clopidogrel and aspirin for patients with acute coronary syndrome who have had angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention ; however , no clear benefit has been shown for patients managed first with drugs only . We assessed outcomes from the TRILOGY ACS trial based on whether or not patients had coronary angiography before treatment was chosen . METHODS TRILOGY ACS ( Clinical Trials.gov number NCT00699998 ) was a r and omised controlled trial , done at more than 800 sites worldwide . Patients with non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome who were selected for management without [ corrected ] revascularisation were r and omly assigned to clopidogrel or prasugrel . The primary endpoint was cardiovascular death , myocardial infa rct ion , or stroke at 30 months . In the present analysis we assessed differences in the primary endpoint by angiography status and whether the effects of treatment on the primary endpoint differed between patients who had angiography before enrolment and those who had not . FINDINGS 7243 patients younger than 75 years were included in the TRILOGY ACS primary analysis . 3085 ( 43 % ) had angiography at baseline , 4158 ( 57 % ) had not . Fewer patients who had angiography reached the primary endpoint at 30 months compared with those who did not have angiography , according to Kaplan-Meier analysis ( 281/3085 [ 12\\u00b78 % ] vs 480/4158 [ 16\\u00b75 % ] , adjusted hazard ratio [ HR ] 0\\u00b763 , 95 % CI 0\\u00b753 - 0\\u00b775 ; p<0\\u00b70001 ) . The proportion of patients who reached the primary endpoint was lower in the prasugrel group than in the clopidogrel group for those who had angiography ( 122/1524 [ 10\\u00b77 % ] vs 159/1561 [ 14\\u00b79 % ] , HR 0\\u00b777 , 95 % CI 0\\u00b761 - 0\\u00b798 ; p=0\\u00b7032 ) but did not differ between groups in patients who did not have angiography ( 242/2096 [ 16\\u00b73 % ] vs 238/2062 [ 16\\u00b77 % ] , HR 1\\u00b701 , 0\\u00b784 - 1\\u00b720 ; p=0\\u00b794 ; pinteraction=0\\u00b708 ) . Overall , TIMI major bleeding and GUSTO severe bleeding were rare . Bleeding outcomes tended to be higher with prasugrel but did not differ significantly between treatment groups in either angiography cohort . INTERPRETATION Among patients who had angiography who took prasugrel there were fewer cardiovascular deaths , myocardial infa rct ions , or strokes than in those who took clopidogrel . This result needs to be corroborated , but it is consistent with previous trials of more versus less intensive antiplatelet treatment . When angiography is done for acute coronary syndrome and anatomic coronary disease confirmed , the benefits and risks of intensive antiplatelet treatment exist whether the patient is treated with drugs or percutaneous coronary intervention .

After the failure of torcetrapib it was unknown if HDL produced by interaction with CETP had pro-atherogenic or pro-inflammatory properties . dal-PLAQUE is the first multicentre study using novel non-invasive multimodality imaging to assess structural and inflammatory indices of atherosclerosis as primary endpoints . METHODS In this phase 2b , double-blind , multicentre trial , patients ( aged 18 - 75 years ) with , or with high risk of , coronary heart disease were r and omly assigned ( 1:1 ) to dalcetrapib 600 mg/day or placebo for 24 months . R and omisation was done with a computer-generated r and omisation code and was stratified by centre . Patients and investigators were masked to treatment . Co primary endpoints were MRI-assessed indices ( total vessel area , wall area , wall thickness , and normalised wall index [ average carotid ] ) after 24 months and (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose ( (18)F-FDG ) PET/CT assessment of arterial inflammation within an index vessel ( right carotid , left carotid , or ascending thoracic aorta ) after 6 months , with no-harm boundaries established before unblinding of the trial . Analysis was by intention to treat . This trial is registered at Clinical Trials.gov , NCT00655473 . FINDINGS 189 patients were screened and 130 r and omly assigned to placebo ( 66 patients ) or dalcetrapib ( 64 patients ) . For the co primary MRI and PET/CT endpoints , CIs were below the no-harm boundary or the adverse change was numerically lower in the dalcetrapib group than in the placebo group . MRI-derived change in total vessel area was reduced in patients given dalcetrapib compared with those given placebo after 24 months ; absolute change from baseline relative to placebo was -4\\u00b701 mm(2 ) ( 90 % CI -7\\u00b723 to -0\\u00b780 ; nominal p=0\\u00b704 ) . The PET/CT measure of index vessel most-diseased-segment target-to- background ratio ( TBR ) was not different between groups , but carotid artery analysis showed a 7 % reduction in most-diseased-segment TBR in the dalcetrapib group compared with the placebo group ( -7\\u00b73 [ 90 % CI -13\\u00b75 to -0\\u00b78 ] ; nominal p=0\\u00b707 ) . Dalcetrapib did not increase office blood pressure and the frequency of adverse events was similar between groups . INTERPRETATION Dalcetrapib showed no evidence of a pathological effect related to the arterial wall over 24 months . Moreover , this trial suggests possible beneficial vascular effects of dalcetrapib , including the reduction in total vessel enlargement over 24 months , but long-term safety and clinical outcomes efficacy of dalcetrapib need to be analysed .

We conducted a phase 3 study of the efficacy and safety of the combination versus gemcitabine monotherapy in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer . METHODS We r and omly assigned patients with a Karnofsky performance-status score of 70 or more ( on a scale from 0 to 100 , with higher scores indicating better performance status ) to nab-paclitaxel ( 125 mg per square meter of body-surface area ) followed by gemcitabine  ( 1000 mg per square meter ) on days 1 , 8 , and 15 every 4 weeks or gemcitabine monotherapy ( 1000 mg per square meter ) weekly for 7 of 8 weeks ( cycle 1 ) and then on days 1 , 8 , and 15 every 4 weeks ( cycle 2 and subsequent cycles ) . Patients received the study treatment until disease progression . The primary end point was overall survival ; secondary end points were progression-free survival and overall response rate . RESULTS A total of 861 patients were r and omly assigned to nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine ( 431 patients ) or gemcitabine  ( 430 ) . The median overall survival was 8.5 months in the nab-paclitaxel-gemcitabine group as compared with 6.7 months in the gemcitabine group ( hazard ratio for death , 0.72 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.62 to 0.83 ; P<0.001 ) . The survival rate was 35 % in the nab-paclitaxel-gemcitabine group versus 22 % in the gemcitabine group at 1 year , and 9 % versus 4 % at 2 years . The median progression-free survival was 5.5 months in the nab-paclitaxel-gemcitabine group , as compared with 3.7 months in the gemcitabine group ( hazard ratio for disease progression or death , 0.69 ; 95 % CI , 0.58 to 0.82 ; P<0.001 ) ; the response rate according to independent review was 23 % versus 7 % in the two groups ( P<0.001 ) . The most common adverse events of grade 3 or higher were neutropenia ( 38 % in the nab-paclitaxel-gemcitabine group vs. 27 % in the gemcitabine group ) , fatigue ( 17 % vs. 7 % ) , and neuropathy ( 17 % vs. 1 % ) . Febrile neutropenia occurred in 3 % versus 1 % of the patients in the two groups . In the nab-paclitaxel-gemcitabine group , neuropathy of grade 3 or higher improved to grade 1 or lower in a median of 29 days . CONCLUSIONS In patients with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma , nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine significantly improved overall survival , progression-free survival , and response rate , but rates of peripheral neuropathy and myelosuppression were increased .

Although well studied in other fields , balanced enrollment of patients with relevant demographic characteristics in vascular surgery r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) is not well known . This study describes the reporting of gender and ethnicity data in vascular surgery RCTs and analyzes whether these studies adequately represent our diverse patient population . METHODS We conducted a retrospective review of United States-based RCTs from 1983 through 2007 for three broadly defined vascular procedures : aortic aneurysm repair ( AAR ) , carotid revascularization ( CR ) , and lower extremity revascularization ( LER ) . Included studies were examined for gender and ethnicity data , study parameters , funding source , and geographic region . The Nationwide Inpatient Sample ( NIS ) data base was analyzed to obtain group-specific procedure frequency as an estimate of procedure frequency in the general population . RESULTS We review ed 77 studies , and 52 met our inclusion criteria . Only 85 % reported gender , and 21 % reported ethnicity . Reporting of ethnicity was strongly associated with larger ( > 280 participants ) , multicenter , government-funded trials ( P < .001 for all ) . Women are disproportionately under-represented in RCTs for all procedure categories ( AAR , 9.0 % vs 21.5 % ; CR , 30.0 % vs 42.9 % ; LER , 22.4 % vs 41.3 % ) . Minorities are under-represented in AAR studies ( 6.0 % vs 10.7 % ) and CR studies ( 6.9 % vs 9.5 % ) but are over-represented in LER studies ( 26.0 % vs 21.8 % , P < .001 for all ) . CONCLUSIONS Minority ethnicity and female gender are under-reported and under-represented in vascular surgery RCTs , particularly in small , non-government-funded and single-center trials . The generalizability of some trial results may not be applicable to these population s. Greater effort to enroll a balanced study population in RCTs may yield more broadly applicable results', 'BACKGROUND Arthroscopic partial meniscectomy is one of the most common orthopedic procedures , yet rigorous evidence of its efficacy is lacking . METHODS We conducted a multicenter , r and omized , double-blind , sham-controlled trial in 146 patients 35 to 65 years of age who had knee symptoms consistent with a degenerative medial meniscus tear and no knee osteoarthritis . Patients were r and omly assigned to arthroscopic partial meniscectomy or sham surgery . The primary outcomes were changes in the Lysholm and Western Ontario Meniscal Evaluation Tool ( WOMET ) scores ( each ranging from 0 to 100 , with lower scores indicating more severe symptoms ) and in knee pain after exercise ( rated on a scale from 0 to 10 , with 0 denoting no pain ) at 12 months after the procedure . RESULTS In the intention-to-treat analysis , there were no significant between-group differences in the change from baseline to 12 months in any primary outcome . The mean changes ( improvements ) in the primary outcome measures were as follows : Lysholm score , 21.7 points in the partial-meniscectomy group as compared with 23.3 points in the sham-surgery group ( between-group difference , -1.6 points ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , -7.2 to 4.0 ) ; WOMET score , 24.6 and 27.1 points , respectively ( between-group difference , -2.5 points ; 95 % CI , -9.2 to 4.1 ) ; and score for knee pain after exercise , 3.1 and 3.3 points , respectively ( between-group difference , -0.1 ; 95 % CI , -0.9 to 0.7 ) . There were no significant differences between groups in the number of patients who required subsequent knee surgery ( two in the partial-meniscectomy group and five in the sham-surgery group ) or serious adverse events ( one and zero , respectively ) . CONCLUSIONS In this trial involving patients without knee osteoarthritis but with symptoms of a degenerative medial meniscus tear , the outcomes after arthroscopic partial meniscectomy were no better than those after a sham surgical procedure .

Other activating RAS mutations may also be negative predictive biomarkers for anti-EGFR therapy . METHODS In this prospect ive-retrospective analysis , we assessed the efficacy and safety of panitumumab plus oxaliplatin , fluorouracil , and leucovorin ( FOLFOX4 ) as compared with FOLFOX4 alone , according to RAS ( KRAS or NRAS ) or BRAF mutation status . A total of 639 patients who had metastatic colorectal cancer without KRAS mutations in exon 2 had results for at least one of the following : KRAS exon 3 or 4 ; NRAS exon 2 , 3 , or 4 ; or BRAF exon 15 . The overall rate of ascertainment of RAS status was 90 % . RESULTS Among 512 patients without RAS mutations , progression-free survival was 10.1 months with panitumumab-FOLFOX4 versus 7.9 months with FOLFOX4 alone ( hazard ratio for progression or death with combination therapy , 0.72 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.58 to 0.90 ; P=0.004 ) . Overall survival was 26.0 months in the panitumumab-FOLFOX4 group versus 20.2 months in the FOLFOX4-alone group ( hazard ratio for death , 0.78 ; 95 % CI , 0.62 to 0.99 ; P=0.04 ) . A total of 108 patients ( 17 % ) with nonmutated KRAS exon 2 had other RAS mutations . These mutations were associated with inferior progression-free survival and overall survival with panitumumab-FOLFOX4 treatment , which was consistent with the findings in patients with KRAS mutations in exon 2 .  BRAF mutations were a negative prognostic factor . No new safety signals were identified . CONCLUSIONS Additional RAS mutations predicted a lack of response in patients who received panitumumab-FOLFOX4 . In patients who had metastatic colorectal cancer without RAS mutations , improvements in overall survival were observed with panitumumab-FOLFOX4 therapy .

METHODS In this multicenter trial , we r and omly assigned patients 40 to 74 years of age with symptoms suggestive of acute coronary syndromes but without ischemic electrocardiographic changes or an initial positive troponin test to early CCTA or to st and ard evaluation in the emergency department on weekdays during daylight hours between April 2010 and January 2012 . The primary end point was length of stay in the hospital . Secondary end points included rates of discharge from the emergency department , major adverse cardiovascular events at 28 days , and cumulative costs . Safety end points were undetected acute coronary syndromes . RESULTS The rate of acute coronary syndromes  among 1000 patients with a mean ( \\u00b1SD ) age of 54\\u00b18 years ( 47 % women ) was 8 % . After early CCTA , as compared with st and ard evaluation  , the mean length of stay in the hospital was reduced by 7.6 hours ( P<0.001 ) and more patients were discharged directly from the emergency department ( 47 % vs. 12 % , P<0.001 ) . There were no undetected acute coronary syndromes and no significant differences in major adverse cardiovascular events at 28 days . After CCTA , there was more downstream testing and higher radiation exposure . The cumulative mean cost of care was similar in the CCTA group and the st and ard-evaluation group ( $ 4,289 and $ 4,060 , respectively ; P=0.65 ) . CONCLUSIONS In patients in the emergency department with symptoms suggestive of acute coronary syndromes , incorporating CCTA into a triage strategy improved the efficiency of clinical decision making , as compared with a st and ard evaluation in the emergency department , but it result ed in an increase in downstream testing and radiation exposure with no decrease in the overall costs of care .

METHODS We did a cluster-r and omised trial in 24 subdistricts in northern Ethiopia , which we r and omly assigned to receive annual or twice-yearly treatment for all residents of all ages . R and om assignment was done with the R AND OM and SORT functions of Microsoft Excel . All individuals were offered their assigned treatment of a single , directly observed , oral dose of azithromycin . A 6 week course of topical 1 % tetracycline ointment , applied twice daily to both eyes but not directly observed , was offered as an alternative to azithromycin in patients younger than 12 months , and in patients with self-reported pregnancy , with allergy , or who refused azithromycin .  Our primary , prespecified outcome was the prevalence of ocular chlamydial infection in a r and om sample of children aged 0 - 9 years at baseline and every 6 months for a total of 42 months within sentinel villages . Our analysis was by intention to treat . This study is registered with Clinical Trials.gov , number NCT00322972 . FINDINGS Antibiotic coverage of children aged 1 - 9 years was greater than 80 % ( range 80\\u00b79 to 93\\u00b70 ) at all study visits . In the groups treated annually , the prevalence of infection in children aged 0 - 9 years was reduced from a mean 41\\u00b79 % ( 95 % CI 31\\u00b75 to 52\\u00b72 ) at baseline to 1\\u00b79 % ( 0\\u00b73 to 3\\u00b75 ) at 42 months .

RESULTS Over a median follow-up period of 43 months ( interquartile range , 31 to 55 ) , the rate of the primary composite end point did not differ significantly between participants who underwent stenting in addition to receiving medical therapy and those who received medical therapy alone ( 35.1 % and 35.8 % , respectively ; hazard ratio with stenting , 0.94 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.76 to 1.17 ; P=0.58 ) . There were also no significant differences between the treatment groups in the rates of the individual components of the primary end point or in all-cause mortality . During follow-up , there was a consistent modest difference in systolic blood pressure favoring the stent group ( -2.3 mm Hg ; 95 % CI , -4.4 to -0.2 ; P=0.03 ) . CONCLUSIONS Renal-artery stenting did not confer a significant benefit with respect to the prevention of clinical events when added to comprehensive , multifactorial medical therapy in people with atherosclerotic renal-artery stenosis and hypertension or chronic kidney disease .

We assessed the effects of provision of two micronutrient powder formulations , with or without zinc , to children in Pakistan . METHODS We did a cluster r and omised trial in urban and rural sites in Sindh , Pakistan . A baseline survey identified 256 clusters , which were r and omly assigned ( within urban and rural strata , by computer-generated r and om numbers ) to one of three groups : non-supplemented control ( group A ) , micronutrient powder without zinc ( group B ) , or micronutrient powder with 10 mg zinc ( group C ) . Children in the clusters aged 6 months were eligible for inclusion in the study . Powders were to be given daily between 6 and 18 months of age ; follow-up was to age 2 years . Micronutrient powder sachets for groups B and C were identical except for colour ; investigators and field and supervisory staff were masked to composition of the micronutrient powders until trial completion . Parents knew whether their child was receiving supplementation , but did not know whether the powder contained zinc . Primary outcomes were growth , episodes of diarrhoea , acute lower respiratory tract infection , fever , and incidence of admission to hospital . This trial is registered with Clinical Trials.gov , number NCT00705445 . RESULTS The trial was done between Nov 1 , 2008 , and Dec 31 , 2011 . 947 children were enrolled in group A clusters , 910 in group B clusters , and 889 in group C clusters . Micronutrient powder administration was associated with lower risk of iron-deficiency anaemia at 18 months compared with the control group ( odds ratio [ OR ] for micronutrient powder without zinc=0\\u00b720 , 95 % CI 0\\u00b711 - 0\\u00b736 ; OR for micronutrient powder with zinc=0\\u00b725 , 95 % CI 0\\u00b714 - 0\\u00b744 ) . Compared with the control group , children in the group receiving micronutrient powder without zinc gained an extra 0\\u00b731 cm ( 95 % CI 0\\u00b703 - 0\\u00b759 ) between 6 and 18 months of age and children receiving micronutrient powder with zinc an extra 0\\u00b756 cm ( 0\\u00b729 - 0\\u00b784 ) . We recorded strong evidence of an increased proportion of days with diarrhoea ( p=0\\u00b7001 ) and increased incidence of bloody diarrhoea ( p=0\\u00b7003 ) between 6 and 18 months in the two micronutrient powder groups , and reported chest indrawing ( p=0\\u00b703 ) . Incidence of febrile episodes or admission to hospital for diarrhoea , respiratory problems , or febrile episodes did not differ between the three groups . INTERPRETATION Use of micronutrient powders reduces iron-deficiency anaemia in young children . However , the excess burden of diarrhoea and respiratory morbidities associated with micronutrient powder use and the very small effect on growth recorded suggest that a careful assessment of risks and benefits must be done in population s with malnourished children and high diarrhoea burdens . FUNDING Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation', 'BACKGROUND It is not known whether low-dose radioiodine ( 1.1 GBq [ 30 mCi ] ) is as effective as high-dose radioiodine ( 3.7 GBq [ 100 mCi ] ) for treating patients with differentiated thyroid cancer or whether the effects of radioiodine ( especially at a low dose ) are influenced by using either recombinant human thyrotropin ( thyrotropin alfa ) or thyroid hormone withdrawal . METHODS At 29 centers in the United Kingdom , we conducted a r and omized noninferiority trial comparing low-dose and high-dose radioiodine , each in combination with either thyrotropin alfa or thyroid hormone withdrawal before ablation .  Patients ( age range , 16 to 80 years ) had tumor stage T1 to T3 , with possible spread to nearby lymph nodes but without metastasis . End points were the rate of success of ablation at 6 to 9 months , adverse events , quality of life , and length of hospital stay . RESULTS A total of 438 patients underwent r and omization ; data could be analyzed for 421 .  Ablation success rates were 85.0 % in the group receiving low-dose radioiodine versus 88.9 % in the group receiving the high dose and 87.1 % in the thyrotropin alfa group versus 86.7 % in the group undergoing thyroid hormone withdrawal . All 95 % confidence intervals for the differences were within \\u00b110 percentage points , indicating noninferiority . Similar results were found for low-dose radioiodine plus thyrotropin alfa ( 84.3 % ) versus high-dose radioiodine plus thyroid hormone withdrawal ( 87.6 % ) or high-dose radioiodine plus thyrotropin alfa ( 90.2 % ) . More patients in the high-dose group than in the low-dose group were hospitalized for at least 3 days ( 36.3 % vs. 13.0 % , P<0.001 ) . The proportions of patients with adverse events were 21 % in the low-dose group versus 33 % in the high-dose group ( P=0.007 ) and 23 % in the thyrotropin alfa group versus 30 % in the group undergoing thyroid hormone withdrawal ( P=0.11 ) .

The CYP2C19 * 2 allele is a common genetic variant associated with increased rates of major adverse events in individuals given clopidogrel after percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) .  We used a novel point-of-care genetic test to identify carriers of the CYP2C19 * 2 allele and aim ed to assess a pharmacogenetic approach to dual antiplatelet treatment after PCI . METHODS Between Aug 26 , 2010 , and July 7 , 2011 , 200 patients were enrolled into our prospect i ve , r and omised , proof-of-concept study . Patients undergoing PCI for acute coronary syndrome or stable angina were r and omly assigned to rapid point-of-care genotyping or to st and ard treatment . Individuals in the rapid genotyping group were screened for the CYP2C19 * 2 allele . Carriers were given 10 mg prasugrel daily , and non-carriers and patients in the st and ard treatment group were given 75 mg clopidogrel daily . The primary endpoint was the proportion of CYP2C19 * 2 carriers with high on-treatment platelet reactivity ( P2Y12 reactivity unit [ PRU ] value of more than 234 ) after 1 week of dual antiplatelet treatment , which is a marker associated with increased adverse cardiovascular events . Interventional cardiologists and data analysts were masked to genetic status and treatment . Patients were not masked to treatment allocation . All analyses were by intention to treat . This study is registered with Clinical Trials.gov , NCT01184300 . FINDINGS After r and omisation , 187 patients completed follow-up ( 91 rapid genotyping group , 96 st and ard treatment ) . 23 individuals in each group carried at least one CYP2C19 * 2 allele . None of the 23 carriers in the rapid genotyping group had a PRU value of more than 234 at day 7 , compared with seven ( 30 % ) given st and ard treatment ( p=0\\u00b70092 ) . The point-of-care genetic test had a sensitivity of 100 % ( 95 % CI 92\\u00b73 - 100 ) and a specificity of 99\\u00b73 % ( 96\\u00b73 - 100 ) . INTERPRETATION Point-of-care genetic testing after PCI can be done effectively at the bedside and treatment of identified CYP2C19 * 2 carriers with prasugrel can reduce high on-treatment platelet reactivity . FUNDING Spartan Biosciences', 'BACKGROUND Autologous fat grafting is increasingly used in reconstructive surgery . However , resorption rates ranging from 25 % to 80 % have been reported . Therefore , methods to increase graft viability are needed . Here , we report the results of a triple-blind , placebo-controlled trial to compare the survival of fat grafts enriched with autologous adipose-derived stem cells ( ASCs ) versus non-enriched fat grafts . METHODS Healthy participants underwent two liposuctions  taken 14 days apart : one for ASC isolation and ex-vivo expansion , and another for the preparation of fat grafts . Two purified fat grafts ( 30 mL each ) taken from the second liposuction were prepared for each participant . One graft was enriched with ASCs ( 20 \\u00d7 10(6 ) cells per mL fat ) , and another graft without ASC enrichment served as a control . The fat grafts were injected subcutaneously as a bolus to the posterior part of the right and left upper arm according to the r and omisation sequence . The volumes of injected fat grafts were measured by MRI immediately after injection and after 121 days before surgical removal . The primary goal was to compare the residual graft volumes of ASC-enriched grafts with those of control grafts . This study is registered at www . clinical trialsregister.eu , number 2010 - 023006 - 12 . FINDINGS 13 participants were enrolled , three of whom were excluded . Compared with the control grafts , the ASC-enriched fat grafts had significantly higher residual volumes : 23\\u00b700 ( 95 % CI 20\\u00b757 - 25\\u00b743 ) cm(3 ) versus 4\\u00b766 ( 3\\u00b716 - 6\\u00b716 ) cm(3 ) for the controls , corresponding to 80\\u00b79 % ( 76\\u00b76 - 85\\u00b72 ) versus 16\\u00b73 % ( 11\\u00b71 - 21\\u00b74 ) of the initial volumes , respectively ( p<0\\u00b70001 ) . The difference between the groups was 18\\u00b734 ( 95 % CI 15\\u00b770 - 20\\u00b798 ) cm(3 ) , equivalent to 64\\u00b76 % ( 57\\u00b71 - 72\\u00b71 ; p<0\\u00b70001 ) . No serious adverse events were noted . INTERPRETATION The procedure of ASC-enriched fat grafting  had excellent feasibility and safety . These promising results add significantly to the prospect of stem cell use in clinical setting s , and indicate that ASC graft enrichment could render lipofilling a reliable alternative to major tissue augmentation , such as breast surgery , with allogeneic material or major flap surgery .

We r and omly allocated participants in a one-to-one ratio , stratified by site and in block sizes of four , to receive once-daily dutasteride 0\\u00b75 mg or matching placebo . Participants were followed up for 3 years , with 12-core prostate biopsy sample s obtained after 18 months and 3 years . The primary endpoint was time to prostate cancer progression , defined as the number of days between the start of study treatment and the earlier of either pathological progression ( in patients with \\u22651 biopsy assessment after baseline ) or therapeutic progression ( start of medical therapy ) .

Dolutegravir , in combination with abacavir-lamivudine , may provide a simplified regimen . METHODS We conducted a r and omized , double-blind , phase 3 study involving adult participants who had not received previous therapy for HIV-1 infection and who had an HIV-1 RNA level of 1000 copies per milliliter or more . Participants were r and omly assigned to dolutegravir at a dose of 50 mg plus abacavir-lamivudine once daily ( DTG-ABC-3TC group ) or combination therapy with efavirenz-tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (DF)-emtricitabine once daily ( EFV-TDF-FTC group ) . The primary end point was the proportion of participants with an HIV-1 RNA level of less than 50 copies per milliliter at week 48 . Secondary end points included the time to viral suppression , the change from baseline in CD4 + T-cell count , safety , and viral resistance . RESULTS A total of 833 participants received at least one dose of study drug . At week 48 , the proportion of participants with an HIV-1 RNA level of less than 50 copies per milliliter was significantly higher in the DTG-ABC-3TC group than in the EFV-TDF-FTC group ( 88 % vs. 81 % , P=0.003 ) , thus meeting the criterion for superiority . The DTG-ABC-3TC group had a shorter median time to viral suppression than did the EFV-TDF-FTC group ( 28 vs. 84 days , P<0.001 ) , as well as greater increases in CD4 + T-cell count ( 267 vs. 208 per cubic millimeter , P<0.001 ) . The proportion of participants who discontinued therapy owing to adverse events was lower in the DTG-ABC-3TC group than in the EFV-TDF-FTC group ( 2 % vs. 10 % ) ; rash and neuropsychiatric events ( including abnormal dreams , anxiety , dizziness , and somnolence ) were significantly more common in the EFV-TDF-FTC group , whereas insomnia was reported more frequently in the DTG-ABC-3TC group . No participants in the DTG-ABC-3TC group had detectable antiviral resistance ; one tenofovir DF-associated mutation and four efavirenz-associated mutations were detected in participants with virologic failure in the EFV-TDF-FTC group . CONCLUSIONS Dolutegravir plus abacavir-lamivudine had a better safety profile and was more effective through 48 weeks than the regimen with efavirenz-tenofovir DF-emtricitabine .

METHODS  RCTs published in nine prominent medical journals in 2009 were identified by PubMed search . Studies where individuals were not the unit of analysis , those begun before 1994 , and those not receiving federal funding were excluded . PubMed search located 512 published articles . After exclusion of ineligible articles , 86 ( 17 % ) remained for analysis . RESULTS Thirty studies were sex specific . The  median enrollment of women in the 56 studies that included both men and women was 37 % .

METHODS We carried out a 36-month , r and omized , double-blind , double-dummy , phase 3 study comparing oral mycophenolate mofetil ( 2 g per day ) and oral azathioprine ( 2 mg per kilogram of body weight per day ) , plus placebo in each group , in patients who met response criteria during a 6-month induction trial . The study group underwent repeat r and omization in a 1:1 ratio . Up to 10 mg of prednisone per day or its equivalent was permitted . The primary efficacy end point was the time to treatment failure , which was defined as death , end-stage renal disease , doubling of the serum creatinine level , renal flare , or rescue therapy for lupus nephritis . Secondary assessment s included the time to the individual components of treatment failure and adverse events . RESULTS A total of 227 patients were r and omly assigned to maintenance treatment ( 116 to mycophenolate mofetil and 111 to azathioprine ) . Mycophenolate mofetil was superior to azathioprine with respect to the primary end point , time to treatment failure ( hazard ratio , 0.44 ; 95 % confidence interval , 0.25 to 0.77 ; P = 0.003 ) , and with respect to time to renal flare and time to rescue therapy ( hazard ratio , < 1.00 ; P < 0.05 ) . Observed rates of treatment failure were 16.4 % ( 19 of 116 patients ) in the mycophenolate mofetil group and 32.4 % ( 36 of 111 ) in the azathioprine group . Adverse events , most commonly minor infections and gastrointestinal disorders , occurred in more than 95 % of the patients in both groups ( P = 0.68 ) . Serious adverse events occurred in 33.3 % of patients in the azathioprine group and in 23.5 % of those in the mycophenolate mofetil group ( P = 0.11 ) , and the rate of withdrawal due to adverse events was higher with azathioprine than with mycophenolate mofetil ( 39.6 % vs. 25.2 % , P = 0.02 ) . CONCLUSIONS Mycophenolate mofetil was superior to azathioprine in maintaining a renal response to treatment and in preventing relapse in patients with lupus nephritis who had a response to induction therapy .

Moderate or severe hemorrhage occurred in seven patients ( 0.3 % ) in the clopidogrel-aspirin group and in eight ( 0.3 % ) in the aspirin group ( P=0.73 ) ; the rate of hemorrhagic stroke was 0.3 % in each group . CONCLUSIONS Among patients with TIA or minor stroke who can be treated within 24 hours after the onset of symptoms , the combination of clopidogrel and aspirin is superior to aspirin alone for reducing the risk of stroke in the first 90 days and does not increase the risk of hemorrhage .

We investigated the effectiveness of tofacitinib ( CP-690,550 ) , a novel oral Janus kinase inhibitor , as a targeted immunomodulator and disease-modifying therapy for rheumatoid arthritis . METHODS We did a 6-month , double-blind , parallel-group phase 3 study at 82 centres in 13 countries , including North America , Europe , and Latin America . 399 patients aged 18 years or older with moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis and inadequate response to tumour necrosis factor inhibitors ( TNFi ) were r and omly assigned in a 2:2:1:1 ratio with an automated internet or telephone system to receive twice a day treatment with : tofacitinib 5 mg ( n=133 ) ; tofacitinib 10 mg ( n=134 ) ; or placebo ( n=132 ) , all with methotrexate . At month 3 , patients given placebo advanced to either tofacitinib 5 mg twice a day ( n=66 ) or 10 mg twice a day ( n=66 ) . Primary endpoints included American College of Rheumatology (ACR)20 response rate , mean change from baseline in Health Assessment Question naire-Disability Index ( HAQ-DI ) , and rates of disease activity score (DAS)28 - 4(ESR ) less than 2\\u00b76 ( referred to as DAS28<2\\u00b76 ) , all at month 3 . The full analysis set for the primary analysis included all r and omised patients who received at least one dose of study medication and had at least one post-baseline assessment . This trial is registered with www . Clinical Trials.gov , number NCT00960440 . FINDINGS At month 3 , ACR20 response rates were 41\\u00b77 % ( 55 of 132 [ 95 % CI vs placebo 6\\u00b706 - 28\\u00b741 ] ; p=0\\u00b70024 ) for tofacitinib 5 mg twice a day and 48\\u00b71 % ( 64 of 133 ; [ 12\\u00b745 - 34\\u00b792 ] ; p<0\\u00b70001 ) for tofacitinib 10 mg twice a day versus 24\\u00b74 % ( 32 of 131 ) for  placebo . Improvements from baseline in HAQ-DI were -0\\u00b743 ( [ -0\\u00b736 to -0\\u00b715 ] ; p<0\\u00b70001 ) for 5 mg twice a day and -0\\u00b746 ( [ -0\\u00b738 to -0\\u00b717 ] ; p<0\\u00b70001 ) for 10 mg twice a day tofacitinib versus -0\\u00b718 for placebo ; DAS28<2\\u00b76 rates were 6\\u00b77 % ( eight of 119 ; [ 0 - 10\\u00b710 ] ; p=0\\u00b70496 ) for 5 mg twice a day tofacitinib and 8\\u00b78 % ( 11 of 125 [ 1\\u00b766 - 12\\u00b760 ] ; p=0\\u00b70105 ) for 10 mg twice a day tofacitinib versus 1\\u00b77 % ( two of 120 ) for  placebo . Safety was consistent with phase 2 and 3 studies . The most common adverse events in months 0 - 3 were diarrhoea ( 13 of 267 ; 4\\u00b79 % ) , nasopharyngitis ( 11 of 267 ; 4\\u00b71 % ) , headache ( 11 of 267 ; 4\\u00b71 % ) , and urinary tract infection ( eight of 267 ; 3\\u00b70 % ) across tofacitinib groups , and nausea ( nine of 132 ; 6\\u00b78 % ) in the placebo group . INTERPRETATION In this treatment-refractory population  , tofacitinib with methotrexate had rapid and clinical ly meaningful improvements in signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis and physical function over 6 months with manageable safety . Tofacitinib could provide an effective treatment option in patients with an inadequate response to TNFi . FUNDING Pfizer', 'BACKGROUND Interim results from the children with HIV early antiretroviral ( CHER ) trial showed that early antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) was life-saving for infants infected with HIV . In view of the few treatment options and the potential toxicity associated with lifelong ART , in the CHER trial we compared early time-limited ART with deferred ART . METHODS CHER was an open-label r and omised controlled trial of HIV-infected asymptomatic infants younger than 12 weeks in two South African trial sites with a percentage of CD4-positive T lymphocytes ( CD4 % ) of 25 % or higher . 377 infants were r and omly allocated to one of three groups : deferred ART ( ART-Def ) , immediate ART for 40 weeks ( ART-40W ) , or immediate ART for 96 weeks ( ART-96W ) , with subsequent treatment interruption . The r and omisation schedule was stratified by clinical site with permuted blocks of r and om sizes to balance the numbers of infants allocated to each group . Criteria for ART initiation in the ART-Def group and re-initiation after interruption in the other groups were CD4 % less than 25 % in infancy ; otherwise , the criteria were CD4 % less than 20 % or Centers for Disease Control and Prevention severe stage B or stage C disease . Combination therapy of lopinavir-ritonavir , zidovudine , and lamivudine was the first-line treatment regimen at ART initiation and re-initiation . The primary endpoint was time to failure of first-line ART ( immunological , clinical , or virological ) or death . Comparisons were done by intention-to-treat analysis , with use of time-to-event methods . This trial is registered with Clinical Trials.gov , number NCT00102960 . FINDINGS 377 infants were enrolled , with a median age of 7\\u00b74 weeks , CD4 % of 35 % , and HIV RNA log 5\\u00b77 copies per mL. Median follow-up was 4\\u00b78 years ; 34 infants ( 9 % ) were lost to follow-up . Median time to ART initiation in the ART-Def group was 20 weeks ( IQR 16 - 25 ) . Time to restarting of ART after interruption was 33 weeks ( 26 - 45 ) in ART-40W and 70 weeks ( 35 - 109 ) in ART-96W ; at the end of the trial , 19 % of patients in ART-40W and 32 % of patients in ART-96W remained off ART . Proportions of follow-up time spent on ART were 81 % in the ART-Def group , 70 % in the ART-40W group , and 69 % in the ART-96W group . 48 ( 38 % ) of 125 children in the ART-Def group , 32 ( 25 % ) of 126 in the ART-40W group , and 26 ( 21 % ) of 126 in the ART-96W group reached the primary endpoint . The hazard ratio , relative to ART-Def , was 0\\u00b759 ( 95 % CI 0\\u00b738 - 0\\u00b793 , p=0\\u00b702 ) for ART-40W and 0\\u00b747 ( 0\\u00b727 - 0\\u00b776 , p=0\\u00b7002 ) for ART-96W . Three children in ART-Def , three in ART-40W , and one in ART-96W switched to second-line ART . INTERPRETATION Early time-limited ART had better clinical and immunological outcomes than deferred ART , with no evidence of excess disease progression during subsequent treatment interruption and less overall ART exposure than deferred ART . Longer time on primary ART permits longer subsequent interruption , with marginally better outcomes . FUNDING US National Institutes of Health', 'BACKGROUND Mortality among patients with severe acute alcoholic hepatitis is high , even among those treated with glucocorticoids . We investigated whether combination therapy with glucocorticoids plus N-acetylcysteine would improve survival . METHODS We r and omly assigned 174 patients to receive prednisolone plus N-acetylcysteine ( 85 patients ) or only prednisolone ( 89 patients ) . All patients received 4 weeks of prednisolone . The prednisolone-N-acetylcysteine group received intravenous N-acetylcysteine on day 1 ( at a dose of 150 , 50 , and 100 mg per kilogram of body weight in 250 , 500 , and 1000 ml of 5 % glucose solution over a period of 30 minutes , 4 hours , and 16 hours , respectively ) and on days 2 through 5 ( 100 mg per kilogram per day in 1000 ml of 5 % glucose solution ) . The prednisolone-only group received an infusion in 1000 ml of 5 % glucose solution per day on days 1 through 5 . The primary outcome was 6-month survival . Secondary outcomes included survival at 1 and 3 months , hepatitis complications , adverse events related to N-acetylcysteine use , and changes in bilirubin levels on days 7 and 14 . RESULTS Mortality was not significantly lower in the prednisolone-N-acetylcysteine group than in the prednisolone-only group at 6 months ( 27 % vs. 38 % , P = 0.07 ) . Mortality was significantly lower at 1 month ( 8 % vs. 24 % , P = 0.006 ) but not at 3 months ( 22 % vs. 34 % , P = 0.06 ) . Death due to the hepatorenal syndrome was less frequent in the prednisolone-N-acetylcysteine group than in the prednisolone-only group at 6 months ( 9 % vs. 22 % , P = 0.02 ) . In a multivariate analysis , factors associated with 6-month survival were a younger age ( P<0.001 ) , a shorter prothrombin time ( P<0.001 ) , a lower level of bilirubin at baseline ( P<0.001 ) , and a decrease in bilirubin on day 14 ( P<0.001 ) . Infections were less frequent in the prednisolone-N-acetylcysteine group than in the prednisolone-only group ( P = 0.001 ) ; other side effects were similar in the two groups . CONCLUSIONS Although combination therapy with prednisolone plus N-acetylcysteine increased 1-month survival among patients with severe acute alcoholic hepatitis , 6-month survival , the primary outcome , was not improved .

The TRACS trial investigated a training programme for caregivers ( the London Stroke Carers Training Course , LSCTC ) on physical and psychological outcomes , including cost-effectiveness , for patients and caregivers after a disabling stroke . METHODS We undertook a pragmatic , multicentre , cluster r and omised controlled trial with a parallel cost-effectiveness analysis . Stroke units were eligible if four of five criteria used to define a stroke unit were met , a substantial number of patients on the unit had a diagnosis of stroke , staff were able to deliver the LSCTC , and most patients were discharged to a permanent place of residence . Stroke units were r and omly assigned to either LSCTC or usual care ( control group ) , stratified by geographical region and quality of care , and using blocks of size 2 . Patients with a diagnosis of stroke , likely to return home with residual disability and with a caregiver providing support were eligible . The primary outcome for patients was self-reported extended activities of daily living at 6 months , measured with the Nottingham Extended Activities of Daily Living ( NEADL ) scale . The primary outcome for caregivers was self-reported burden at 6 months , measured with the caregivers burden scale ( CBS ) . We combined patient and caregiver costs with primary outcomes and quality -adjusted life-years ( QALYs ) to assess cost-effectiveness . This trial is registered with controlled-trials.com , number IS RCT N 49208824 . FINDINGS We assessed 49 stroke units for eligibility , of which 36 were r and omly assigned to either the intervention group or the control group . Between Feb 27 , 2008 , and Feb 9 , 2010 , 928 patient and caregiver dyads were registered , of which 450 were in the intervention group , and 478 in the control group .  Patients ' self-reported extended activities of daily living did not differ between groups at 6 months ( adjusted mean NEADL score 27\\u00b74 in the intervention group versus 27\\u00b76 in the control group , difference -0\\u00b72 points [ 95 % CI -3\\u00b70 to 2\\u00b75 ] , p value=0\\u00b7866 , ICC=0\\u00b7027 ) . The caregiver burden scale did not differ between groups either ( adjusted mean CBS 45\\u00b75 in the intervention group versus 45\\u00b70 in the control group , difference 0\\u00b75 points [ 95 % CI -1\\u00b77 to 2\\u00b77 ] , p value=0\\u00b7660 , ICC=0\\u00b7013 ) . Patient and caregiver costs were similar in both groups ( length of the initial stroke admission and associated costs were \\u00a3 13,127 for the intervention group and \\u00a3 12,471 for the control group ; adjusted mean difference \\u00a3 1243 [ 95 % CI -1533 to 4019 ] ; p value=0\\u00b7380 ) . Probabilities of cost-effectiveness based on QALYs were low . INTERPRETATION In a large scale , robust evaluation , results from this study have shown no differences between the LSCTC and usual care on any of the assessed outcomes . The immediate period after stroke might not be the ideal time to deliver structured caregiver training . FUNDING Medical Research Council\\\", 'Differential enrollment into clinical trials by gender has been described previously . In 1993 , the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) Revitalization Act was enacted to promote the inclusion of women in clinical trials . The purpose of this study was to review patterns in clinical trial enrollment among studies published in a major medical journal to determine the effects of this policy . A systematic search was conducted of all articles published in the Original Articles section of The New Engl and Journal of Medicine from 1994 to 1999 . Two independent observers abstract ed information from the r and omized clinical trials using st and ardized forms . All r and omized clinical trials in which the primary end point was total mortality or included mortality in a composite end point were considered for review . Trials were analyzed for enrollment of women with respect to disease state , funding source , site of trial performance , and use of gender-specific data analysis . From 1994 to 1999 , 1322 original articles were published in The New Engl and Journal of Medicine , including 442 r and omized , controlled trials of which 120 met our inclusion criteria . On average , 24.6 % women were enrolled .  Gender-specific data analysis was performed in 14 % of the trials .

METHODS We r and omly assigned 365 adults with JAK2-positive polycythemia vera who were being treated with phlebotomy , hydroxyurea , or both to receive either more intensive treatment ( target hematocrit , < 45 % ) ( low-hematocrit group ) or less intensive treatment ( target hematocrit , 45 to 50 % ) ( high-hematocrit group ) . The primary composite end point was the time until death from cardiovascular causes or major thrombotic events . The secondary end points were cardiovascular events , cardiovascular hospitalizations , incidence of cancer , progression to myelofibrosis , myelodysplasia or leukemic transformation , and hemorrhage . An intention-to-treat analysis was performed . RESULTS After a median follow-up of 31 months , the primary end point was recorded in 5 of 182 patients in the low-hematocrit group ( 2.7 % ) and 18 of 183 patients in the high-hematocrit group ( 9.8 % ) ( hazard ratio in the high-hematocrit group , 3.91 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 1.45 to 10.53 ; P=0.007 ) . The primary end point plus superficial-vein thrombosis occurred in 4.4 % of patients in the low-hematocrit group , as compared with 10.9 % in the high-hematocrit group ( hazard ratio , 2.69 ; 95 % CI , 1.19 to 6.12 ; P=0.02 ) . Progression to myelofibrosis , myelodysplasia or leukemic transformation , and bleeding were observed in 6 , 2 , and 2 patients , respectively , in the low-hematocrit group , as compared with 2 , 1 , and 5 patients , respectively , in the high-hematocrit group . There was no significant between-group difference in the rate of adverse events .

METHODS We conducted a phase 3 , multicenter trial comparing ATRA plus chemotherapy with ATRA plus arsenic trioxide in patients with APL classified as low-to-intermediate risk ( white-cell count , \\u226410 \\u00d7 10(9 ) per liter ) . Patients were r and omly assigned to receive either ATRA plus arsenic trioxide for induction and consolidation therapy or st and ard ATRA-idarubicin induction therapy followed by three cycles of consolidation therapy with ATRA plus chemotherapy and maintenance therapy with low-dose chemotherapy and ATRA . The study was design ed as a noninferiority trial to show that the difference between the rates of event-free survival at 2 years in the two groups was not greater than 5 % . RESULTS Complete remission was achieved in all 77 patients in the ATRA-arsenic  trioxide group who could be evaluated ( 100 % ) and in 75 of 79 patients in the ATRA-chemotherapy group ( 95 % ) ( P=0.12 ) . The median follow-up was 34.4 months .

METHODS Patients with Alzheimer 's disease and psychosis or agitation-aggression received open-label treatment with risperidone for 16 weeks . Those who had a response to risperidone therapy were then r and omly assigned , in a double-blind fashion , to one of three regimens : continued risperidone therapy for 32 weeks ( group 1 ) , risperidone therapy for 16 weeks followed by placebo for 16 weeks ( group 2 ) , or placebo for 32 weeks ( group 3 ) . The primary outcome was the time to relapse of psychosis or agitation . RESULTS A total of 180 patients received open-label  risperidone ( mean dose , 0.97 mg daily ) . The severity of psychosis and agitation were reduced , although there was a mild increase in extrapyramidal signs ;  112 patients met the criteria for response to treatment , of whom 110 underwent r and omization . In the first 16 weeks after r and omization , the rate of relapse was higher in the group that received placebo than in the groups that received risperidone ( 60 % [ 24 of 40 patients in group 3 ] vs. 33 % [ 23 of 70 in groups 1 and 2 ] ; P=0.004 ; hazard ratio with placebo , 1.94 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 1.09 to 3.45 ; P=0.02 ) .

METHODS We conducted a double-blind , placebo-controlled trial in which 1537 patients with probable Alzheimer 's disease underwent r and omization to receive 100 mg of semagacestat , 140 mg of semagacestat , or placebo daily .  Changes in cognition from baseline to week 76 were assessed with the use of the cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer 's Disease Assessment Scale for cognition ( ADAS-cog ) , on which scores range from 0 to 70 and higher scores indicate greater cognitive impairment , and changes in functioning were assessed with the Alzheimer 's Disease Cooperative Study -Activities of Daily Living ( ADCS-ADL ) scale , on which scores range from 0 to 78 and higher scores indicate better functioning . A mixed-model repeated- measures analysis was used . RESULTS The trial was terminated before completion on the basis of a recommendation by the data and safety monitoring board . At termination , there were 189 patients in the group receiving placebo  , 153 patients in the group receiving 100 mg of semagacestat , and 121 patients in the group receiving 140 mg of semagacestat .

A total of 85 patients , the majority of whom were considered to have high-risk disease , received ibrutinib orally once daily ; 51 received 420 mg , and 34 received 840 mg . RESULTS Toxic effects were predominantly grade 1 or 2 and included transient diarrhea , fatigue , and upper respiratory tract infection ; thus , patients could receive extended treatment with minimal hematologic toxic effects . The overall response rate was the same in the group that received 420 mg and the group that received 840 mg ( 71 % ) , and an additional 20 % and 15 % of patients in the respective groups had a partial response with lymphocytosis . The response was independent of clinical and genomic risk factors present before treatment , including advanced-stage disease , the number of previous therapies , and the 17p13.1 deletion .

A partial response or better was achieved in 79 % of patients in the treatment group after the induction phase and in 90 % during the maintenance phase . Toxic effects were mainly grade 2 or lower . CONCLUSIONS Early treatment for patients with high-risk smoldering myeloma delays progression to active disease and increases overall survival .

We assessed cardiovascular outcomes with alogliptin , a new inhibitor of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 ( DPP-4 ) , as compared with placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes who had had a recent acute coronary syndrome . METHODS We r and omly assigned patients with type 2 diabetes and either an acute myocardial infa rct ion or unstable angina requiring hospitalization within the previous 15 to 90 days to receive alogliptin or placebo in addition to existing antihyperglycemic and cardiovascular drug therapy . The study design was a double-blind , noninferiority trial with a prespecified noninferiority margin of 1.3 for the hazard ratio for the primary end point of a composite of death from cardiovascular causes , nonfatal myocardial infa rct ion , or nonfatal stroke . RESULTS A total of 5380 patients underwent r and omization and were followed for up to 40 months ( median , 18 months ) . A primary end-point event occurred in 305 patients assigned to alogliptin ( 11.3 % ) and in 316 patients assigned to placebo ( 11.8 % ) ( hazard ratio , 0.96 ; upper boundary of the one-sided repeated confidence interval , 1.16 ; P<0.001 for noninferiority ) . Glycated hemoglobin levels were significantly lower with alogliptin than with placebo ( mean difference , -0.36 percentage points ; P<0.001 ) . Incidences of hypoglycemia , cancer , pancreatitis , and initiation of dialysis were similar with alogliptin and placebo . CONCLUSIONS Among patients with type 2 diabetes who had had a recent acute coronary syndrome , the rates of major adverse cardiovascular events were not increased with the DPP-4 inhibitor alogliptin as compared with placebo . ( Funded by Takeda Development Center Americas ; EXAMINE Clinical Trials.gov number , NCT00968708 . )', 'BACKGROUND Although P2Y12 antagonists are effective in patients with non-ST-segment elevation ( NSTE ) acute coronary syndromes , the effect of the timing of administration -- before or after coronary angiography -- is not known . We evaluated the effect of administering the P2Y12 antagonist prasugrel at the time of diagnosis versus administering it after the coronary angiography if percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) was indicated . METHODS We enrolled 4033 patients with NSTE acute coronary syndromes and a positive troponin level who were scheduled to undergo coronary angiography within 2 to 48 hours after r and omization . Patients were r and omly assigned to receive prasugrel ( a 30-mg loading dose ) before the angiography ( pretreatment group ) or placebo ( control group ) . When PCI was indicated , an additional 30 mg of prasugrel was given in the pretreatment group at the time of PCI and 60 mg of prasugrel was given in the control group . RESULTS The rate of the primary efficacy end point , a composite of death from cardiovascular causes , myocardial infa rct ion , stroke , urgent revascularization , or glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor rescue therapy ( glycoprotein IIb/IIIa bailout ) through day 7 , did not differ significantly between the two groups ( hazard ratio with pretreatment , 1.02 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.84 to 1.25 ; P=0.81 ) . The rate of the key safety end point of all Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infa rct ion ( TIMI ) major bleeding episodes , whether related or not related to coronary-artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) , through day 7 was increased with pretreatment ( hazard ratio , 1.90 ; 95 % CI , 1.19 to 3.02 ; P=0.006 ) . The rates of TIMI major bleeding and life-threatening bleeding not related to CABG were increased by a factor of 3 and 6 , respectively . Pretreatment did not reduce the rate of the primary outcome among patients undergoing PCI ( 69 % of the patients ) but increased the rate of TIMI major bleeding at 7 days . All the results were confirmed at 30 days and in prespecified subgroups . CONCLUSIONS Among patients with NSTE acute coronary syndromes who were scheduled to undergo catheterization , pretreatment with prasugrel did not reduce the rate of major ischemic events up to 30 days but increased the rate of major bleeding complications .

Cough affects up to 80 % of patients with IPF , is frequently disabling , and lacks effective therapy . OBJECTIVE To determine the efficacy of thalidomide in suppressing cough in patients with IPF . DESIGN 24-week , double-blind , 2-treatment , 2-period crossover trial . ( Clinical Trials.gov registration number : NCT00600028 ) SETTING 1 university center . PARTICIPANTS 98 participants were screened , 24 were r and omly assigned , 23 received treatment ( 78.3 % men ; mean age , 67.6 years ; mean FVC , 70.4 % predicted ) , and 20 completed both treatment periods . MEASUREMENTS The primary end point was cough-specific quality of life measured by the Cough Quality of Life Question naire ( CQLQ ) . Secondary end points were visual analogue scale of cough and the St. George 's Respiratory Question naire ( SGRQ ) . For all measures , lower scores equaled improved cough or respiratory quality of life . RESULTS CQLQ scores significantly improved with thalidomide ( mean difference vs. placebo , -11.4 [ 95 % CI , -15.7 to -7.0 ] ; P < 0.001 ) . Thalidomide also significantly improved scores on the visual analogue scale of cough ( mean difference vs. placebo , -31.2 [ CI , -45.2 to -17.2 ] ; P < 0.001 ) . In participants receiving thalidomide , scores from the total SGRQ , SGRQ symptom domain , and SGRQ impact domain improved compared with those of participants receiving placebo .  Adverse events were reported in 74 % of patients receiving thalidomide and 22 % receiving placebo ;  constipation , dizziness , and malaise were more frequent with thalidomide . LIMITATION This was a single-center study of short duration and small sample size focused on symptom-specific quality of life . CONCLUSION Thalidomide improved cough and respiratory quality of life in patients with IPF . A larger trial is warranted to assess these promising results .

OBJECTIVE To compare extended prophylaxis with aspirin and dalteparin for prevention of symptomatic venous thromboembolism ( VTE )  after THA . DESIGN Multicenter r and omized , controlled trial with a noninferiority design based on a minimal clinical ly important difference of 2.0 % . R and omization was electronically generated ; patients were assigned to a treatment group through a Web-based program . Patients , physicians , study coordinators , health care team members , outcome adjudicators , and data analysts were blinded to interventions . ( Current Controlled Trials : IS RCT N11902170 ) . SETTING 12 tertiary care orthopedic referral centers in Canada . PATIENTS 778 patients who had elective unilateral THA between 2007 and 2010 . INTERVENTION After an initial 10 days of dalteparin prophylaxis after elective THA , patients were r and omly assigned to 28 days of dalteparin ( n = 400 ) or aspirin ( n = 386 ) . MEASUREMENTS Symptomatic VTE confirmed by objective testing ( primary efficacy outcome ) and bleeding . RESULTS Five of 398 patients ( 1.3 % ) r and omly assigned to dalteparin and 1 of 380 ( 0.3 % ) r and omly assigned to aspirin  had VTE ( absolute difference , 1.0 percentage point [ 95 % CI , -0.5 to 2.5 percentage points ] ) . Aspirin was noninferior ( P < 0.001 ) but not superior ( P = 0.22 ) to dalteparin . Clinical ly significant bleeding occurred in 5 patients ( 1.3 % ) receiving dalteparin and 2 ( 0.5 % ) receiving aspirin . The absolute between-group difference in a composite of all VTE and clinical ly significant bleeding events was 1.7 percentage points ( CI , -0.3 to 3.8 percentage points ; P = 0.091 ) in favor of aspirin . LIMITATION The study was halted prematurely because of difficulty with patient recruitment . CONCLUSION Extended prophylaxis for 28 days with aspirin was noninferior to and as safe as dalteparin for the prevention of VTE after THA in patients who initially received dalteparin for 10 days . Given its low cost and greater convenience , aspirin may be considered a reasonable alternative for extended thromboprophylaxis after THA .

              "\"['Although transplantation of adult bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells ( BM-MSCs ) holds promise in the treatment for pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ) , the poor survival and differentiation potential of adult BM-MSCs have limited their therapeutic efficiency . Here , we compared the therapeutic efficacy of human embryonic stem cell-derived MSCs ( hESC-MSCs ) with adult BM-MSCs for the treatment of PAH in an animal model . One week following monocrotaline (MCT)-induced PAH , mice were r and omly assigned to receive phosphate-buffered saline ( MCT group ) ; 3.0 × 106 human BM-derived MSCs ( BM-MSCs group ) or 3.0 × 106 hESC-derived MSCs ( hESC-MSCs group ) via tail vein injection . At 3 weeks posttransplantation , the right ventricular systolic pressure ( RVSP ) , degree of RV hypertrophy , and medial wall thickening of pulmonary arteries were lower= , and pulmonary capillary density was higher in the hESC-MSC group as compared with BM-MSC and MCT groups ( all p < 0.05 ) . At 1 week posttransplantation , the number of engrafted MSCs in the lungs was found significantly higher in the hESC-MSC group than in the BM-MSC group ( all p < 0.01 ) . At 3 weeks posttransplantation , implanted BM-MSCs were undetectable whereas hESC-MSCs were not only engrafted in injured pulmonary arteries but had also undergone endothelial differentiation . In addition , protein profiling of hESC-MSC- and BM-MSC-conditioned medium revealed a differential paracrine capacity . Classification of these factors into bioprocesses revealed that secreted factors from hESC-MSCs were preferentially involved in early embryonic development and tissue differentiation , especially blood vessel morphogenesis . We concluded that improved cell survival and paracrine capacity of hESC-MSCs provide better therapeutic efficacy than BM-MSCs in the treatment for PAH', 'Abstract We investigated the effect of adipose-derived stem cells ( ADSCs ) transplantation effects on structural remodeling and pulmonary artery pressure in  monocrotaline (MCT)-induced pulmonary hypertensive rats . In the first experiment , 32 male Sprague-Dawley ( SD ) rats were r and omly divided into four groups ( n = 8/group ) : 3 ADSCs treated groups and normal control ( Ctrl ) . ADSCs were administered through the left jugular vein at 105 , 106 and 107 cells , respectively , and a cell density of 106cells/ml was shown to be optimal . The GFP-tagged ADSCs were identified in the lungs and differentiated into endothelial-like cells . In the second experiment , 96 male SD rats were r and omly divided into three groups ( n = 32/group ) : Ctrl , MCT-induced pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ) , and PAH treated with ADSCs ( ADSCs ) . Two weeks post-MCT administration , the ADSCs group received 1 × 106 ADSCs via the external jugular vein . Compared to PAH rats , mean pulmonary arterial pressure was decreased in rats at 1 , 2 , and 3 weeks after ADSCs-treatment ( 18.63 ± 2.15 mmHg versus 24.53 ± 2.90 mmHg ; 23.07 ± 2.84 mmHg versus 33.18 ± 2.30 mmHg ; 22.98 ± 2.34 mmHg versus 36.38 ± 3.28 mmHg , p < 0.05 ) . Meanwhile , the right heart hypertrophy index ( 36.2 1 ± 4.27 % versus 41.01 ± 1.29 % ; 39.47 ± 4.02 % versus 48.75 ± 2 .13 % ; 41.02 ± 0.9 % versus 50.52 ± 1.49 % , p < 0.05 , respectively ) , ratio of wall/lumen thickness , as well as the wall/lumen area were significantly reduced in PAH rats at these time points following ADSCs-treatment , as compared with untreated PAH rats . In summary , ADSCs may colonize the pulmonary arteries , attenuate pulmonary arterial hypertension and ameliorate pulmonary arterial remodeling', 'The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell ( BMSC ) transp1antation on lung and heart damage in a rat model of monocrotaline (MCT)-induced pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ) . The animals were r and omly divided into 3 groups : control , PAH  and  BMSC implantation  groups . Structural changes in the pulmonary vascular wall , such as the pulmonary artery lumen area ( VA ) and vascular area ( TAA ) were measured by hematoxylin and eosin ( H&E ) staining , and the hemodynamics were detected by echocardiography . Two weeks post-operation , our results demonstrated that sublingual vein injection of BMSCs significantly attenuated the pulmonary vascular structural and hemodynamic changes caused by pulmonary arterial hypertension . The mechanism may be executed via paracrine effects', 'OBJECTIVE To characterize mortality in persons diagnosed with primary pulmonary hypertension and to investigate factors associated with survival . DESIGN Registry with prospect i ve follow-up . SETTING Thirty-two clinical centers in the United States participating in the Patient Registry for the Characterization of Primary Pulmonary Hypertension supported by the National Heart , Lung , and Blood Institute . PATIENTS Patients ( 194 ) diagnosed at clinical centers between 1 July 1981 and 31 December 1985 and followed through 8 August 1988 . MEASUREMENTS At diagnosis , measurements of hemodynamic variables , pulmonary function , and gas exchange variables were taken in addition to information on demographic variables , medical history , and life-style . Patients were followed for survival at 6-month intervals . MAIN RESULTS The estimated median survival of these patients was 2.8 years ( 95 % Cl , 1.9 to 3.7 years ) . Estimated single-year survival rates were as follows : at 1 year , 68 % ( Cl , 61 % to 75 % ) ; at 3 years , 48 % ( Cl , 41 % to 55 % ) ; and at 5 years , 34 % ( Cl , 24 % to 44 % ) . Variables associated with poor survival included a New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) functional class of III or IV , presence of Raynaud phenomenon , elevated mean right atrial pressure , elevated mean pulmonary artery pressure , decreased cardiac index , and decreased diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide ( DLCO ) . Drug therapy at entry or discharge was not associated with survival duration . CONCLUSIONS Mortality was most closely associated with right ventricular hemodynamic function and can be characterized by means of an equation using three variables : mean pulmonary artery pressure , mean right atrial pressure , and cardiac index . Such an equation , once vali date d prospect ively , could be used as an adjunct in planning treatment strategies and allocating medical re sources', 'BACKGROUND Sildenafil inhibits phosphodiesterase type 5 , an enzyme that metabolizes cyclic guanosine monophosphate , thereby enhancing the cyclic guanosine monophosphate-mediated relaxation and growth inhibition of vascular smooth-muscle cells , including those in the lung . METHODS In this double-blind , placebo-controlled study , we r and omly assigned 278 patients with symptomatic pulmonary arterial hypertension ( either idiopathic or associated with connective-tissue disease or with repaired congenital systemic-to-pulmonary shunts ) to placebo or sildenafil  ( 20 , 40 , or 80 mg ) orally three times daily for 12 weeks . The primary end point was the change from baseline to week 12 in the distance walked in six minutes . The change in mean pulmonary-artery pressure and World Health Organization ( WHO ) functional class and the incidence of clinical worsening were also assessed , but the study was not powered to assess mortality . Patients completing the 12-week r and omized study could enter a long-term extension study . RESULTS The distance walked in six minutes increased from baseline in all sildenafil groups ; the mean placebo-corrected treatment effects were 45 m ( + 13.0 percent ) , 46 m ( + 13.3 percent ) , and 50 m ( + 14.7 percent ) for 20 , 40 , and 80 mg of sildenafil , respectively ( P<0.001 for all comparisons ) . All sildenafil doses reduced the mean pulmonary-artery pressure ( P=0.04 , P=0.01 , and P<0.001 , respectively ) , improved the WHO functional class ( P=0.003 , P<0.001 , and P<0.001 , respectively ) , and were associated with side effects such as flushing , dyspepsia , and diarrhea . The incidence of clinical worsening did not differ significantly between the patients treated with sildenafil and those treated with placebo . Among the 222 patients completing one year of treatment with sildenafil monotherapy , the improvement from baseline at one year in the distance walked in six minutes was 51 m. CONCLUSIONS Sildenafil improves exercise capacity , WHO functional class , and hemodynamics in patients with symptomatic pulmonary arterial hypertension', 'BACKGROUND Current therapies for pulmonary arterial hypertension have been adopted on the basis of short-term trials with exercise capacity as the primary end point . We assessed the efficacy of macitentan , a new dual endothelin-receptor antagonist , using a primary end point of morbidity and mortality in a long-term trial . METHODS We r and omly assigned patients with symptomatic pulmonary arterial hypertension to receive placebo once daily , macitentan at a once-daily dose of 3 mg , or macitentan at a once-daily dose of 10 mg . Stable use of oral or inhaled therapy for pulmonary arterial hypertension , other than endothelin-receptor antagonists , was allowed at study entry . The primary end point was the time from the initiation of treatment to the first occurrence of a composite end point of death , atrial septostomy , lung transplantation , initiation of treatment with intravenous or subcutaneous prostanoids , or worsening of pulmonary arterial hypertension . RESULTS A total of 250 patients were r and omly assigned to placebo , 250 to the 3-mg macitentan dose , and 242 to the 10-mg macitentan dose . The primary end point occurred in 46.4 % , 38.0 % , and 31.4 % of the patients in these groups , respectively . The hazard ratio for the 3-mg macitentan dose as compared with placebo was 0.70 ( 97.5 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.52 to 0.96 ; P=0.01 ) , and the hazard ratio for the 10-mg macitentan dose as compared with placebo was 0.55 ( 97.5 % CI , 0.39 to 0.76 ; P<0.001 ) . Worsening of pulmonary arterial hypertension was the most frequent primary end-point event . The effect of macitentan on this end point was observed regardless of whether the patient was receiving therapy for pulmonary arterial hypertension at baseline . Adverse events more frequently associated with macitentan than with placebo were headache , nasopharyngitis , and anemia . CONCLUSIONS Macitentan significantly reduced morbidity and mortality among patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension in this event-driven study .

The aim of this study was to further investigate the long-term effect of BMSCs on PAH and to explore the mechanism of the protective effect including the pulmonary vascular remodeling and cell differentiation . PAH model was established by subcutaneous injection of 50 mg/kg MCT as previously study . Postoperatively , the animals were r and omly divided into three groups ( n = 10 in each group ) : control , PAH group , and BMSCs implantation group . Six months after injection , immunology and immunohistochemistry analysis indicated the  MCT-induced intima-media thickness in muscular arteries was reduced ( P < 0.05 ) ; the area of collagen fibers in lung tissue was lower ( P < 0.05 ) , and the proliferating cell nuclear antigen level in pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells was decreased ( P < 0.05 ) . Immunofluorescence showed that the cells have the ability to differentiate between von Willebr and factor and vascular endothelial growth factor . Six months after intravenous injection , BMSCs could significantly improve pulmonary function by inhibiting the ventricular remodeling and the effect of cell differentiation', 'Experimental data suggest that transplantation of EPCs attenuates monocrotaline-induced pulmonary hypertension in rats and dogs . In addition , our previous studies suggested that autologous EPC transplantation was feasible , safe , and might have beneficial effects on exercise capacity and pulmonary hemodynamics in adults with IPAH . Thus , we hypothesized that transplantation of EPCs would improve exercise capacity and pulmonary hemodynamics in children with IPAH . Thirteen children with IPAH received intravenous infusion of autologous EPCs . The right-sided heart catheterization and 6-MWD test were performed at baseline and at the time of 12 wk after cell infusion . At the time of 12 wk , mPAP decreased by 6.4 mmHg from 70.3 + /- 19.0 to 63.9 + /- 19.3 mmHg ( p = 0.015 ) . PVR decreased by approximately 19 % from 1118 + /- 537 to 906 + /- 377 dyn s/cm(5 ) ( p = 0.047 ) . CO increased from 3.39 + /- 0.79 to 3.85 + /- 0.42 L/min ( p = 0.048 ) . The 6-MWD increased by 39 m from 359 + /- 82 to 399 + /- 74 m ( p = 0.012 ) . NYHA functional class also improved . There were no severe adverse events with cell infusion . The small pilot study suggested that intravenous infusion of autologous EPCs was feasible , safe , and associated with significant improvements in exercise capacity , NYHA functional class , and pulmonary hemodynamics in children with IPAH . Confirmation of these results in a r and omized controlled trial are essential', 'BACKGROUND Uncontrolled studies suggested that aerosolized iloprost , a stable analogue of prostacyclin , causes selective pulmonary vasodilatation and improves hemodynamics and exercise capacity in patients with pulmonary hypertension . METHODS We compared repeated daily inhalations of 2.5 or 5.0 microg of iloprost ( six or nine times per day ; median inhaled dose , 30 microg per day ) with inhalation of placebo .  A total of 203 patients with selected forms of severe pulmonary arterial hypertension and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension ( New York Heart Association [ NYHA ] functional class III or IV ) were included . The primary end point was met if , after week 12 , the NYHA class and distance walked in six minutes were improved by at least one class and at least 10 percent , respectively , in the absence of clinical deterioration according to predefined criteria and death . RESULTS The combined clinical end point was met by 16.8 percent of the patients receiving iloprost , as compared with 4.9 percent of the patients receiving placebo ( P=0.007 ) . There were increases in the distance walked in six minutes of 36.4 m in the iloprost group as a whole ( P=0.004 ) and of 58.8 m in the subgroup of patients with primary pulmonary hypertension . Overall , 4.0 percent of patients in the iloprost group ( including one who died ) and 13.7 percent of those in the placebo group ( including four who died ) did not complete the study ( P=0.024 ) ; the most common reason for withdrawal was clinical deterioration . As compared with base-line values , hemodynamic values were significantly improved at 12 weeks when measured after iloprost inhalation ( P<0.001 ) , were largely unchanged when measured before iloprost inhalation , and were significantly worse in the placebo group . Further significant beneficial effects of iloprost treatment included an improvement in the NYHA class ( P=0.03 ) , dyspnea ( P=0.015 ) , and quality of life ( P=0.026 ) . Syncope occurred with similar frequency in the two groups but was more frequently rated as serious in the iloprost group , although this adverse effect was not associated with clinical deterioration . CONCLUSIONS Inhaled iloprost is an effective therapy for patients with severe pulmonary hypertension', 'BACKGROUND High pulmonary vascular resistance ( PVR ) may be a risk factor for early and late mortality in both Glen shunt and Fontan operation patients . Furthermore , PVR may increase long after the Fontan operation . Whether pulmonary vasodilators such as phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors can decrease PVR in patients with single ventricular physiology remains undetermined . METHODS AND RESULTS This was a prospect i ve , multicenter study . Patients with single ventricular physiology who have a PVR index higher than 2.5 Wood units · ㎡ ( WU ) were enrolled .  Cardiac catheterization was performed before and after administration of sildenafil in all patients . After the Fontan operation , a  six minute walk test  ( 6MWT ) was also performed . A total of 42 patients were enrolled . PVR was significantly decreased in each stage of single ventricular physiology after sildenafil administration : from 4.3±1.5WU to 2.1±0.6WU ( p<0.01 ) in patients before a Glenn shunt , from 3.2±0.5WU to 1.6±0.6WU ( p<0.001 ) in patients after a Glenn shunt , and from 3.9±1.7WU to 2.3±0.8WU ( p<0.001 ) in patients after Fontan . In patients after Fontan , the 6MWT increased from 416±74 m to 485±72 m ( p<0.01 ) , and NYHA functional class improved significantly ( p<0.05 ) after sildenafil administration . No major side effects were observed in any patients . CONCLUSIONS Sildenafil reduced PVR in patients with single ventricle physiology . Sildenafil increased exercise capacity and improved NYHA functional class in patients after a Fontan operation . This implies that pulmonary vasodilation is a potential therapeutic target in selected patients with elevated PVR with single ventricle physiology . Long-term clinical significance warrants further study', 'OBJECTIVES The purpose of this study was to examine the efficacy and safety of four doses of ambrisentan , an oral endothelin type A receptor-selective antagonist , in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ) . BACKGROUND Pulmonary arterial hypertension is a life-threatening and progressive disease with limited treatment options . Endothelin is a vasoconstrictor and smooth muscle cell mitogen that plays a critical role in the pathogenesis and progression of PAH . METHODS In this double-blind , dose-ranging study , 64 patients with idiopathic PAH or PAH associated with collagen vascular disease , anorexigen use , or human immunodeficiency virus infection were r and omized to receive 1 , 2.5 , 5 , or 10 mg of ambrisentan once daily for 12 weeks followed by 12 weeks of open-label ambrisentan . The primary end point was an improvement from baseline in 6-min walk distance ( 6MWD ) ; secondary end points included Borg dyspnea index , World Health Organization ( WHO ) functional class , a subject global assessment , and cardiopulmonary hemodynamics . RESULTS At 12 weeks , ambrisentan increased 6MWD ( + 36.1 m , p < 0.0001 ) with similar and statistically significant increases for each dose group ( range , + 33.9 to + 38.1 m ) . Improvements were also observed in Borg dyspnea index , WHO functional class , subject global assessment , mean pulmonary arterial pressure ( -5.2 mm Hg , p < 0.0001 ) , and cardiac index ( + 0.33 l/min/m2 , p < 0.0008 ) . Adverse events were mild and unrelated to dose , including the incidence of elevated serum aminotransferase concentrations > 3 times the upper limit of normal ( 3.1 % ) . CONCLUSIONS Ambrisentan appears to improve exercise capacity , symptoms , and hemodynamics in patients with PAH . The incidence and severity of liver enzyme abnormalities appear to be low', 'UNLABELLED Pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ) is characterized by functional and structural changes in the pulmonary vasculature , and despite the drug treatment that made significant progress , the prognosis of patients with advanced PH remains extremely poor . In the present study , we investigated the early effect of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells ( BMSCs ) on experimental high blood flow-induced PAH model rats and discussed the mechanism . BMSCs were isolated , cultured from bone marrow of Sprague-Dawley ( SD ) rat . The animal model of PAH was created by surgical methods to produce a left-to-right shunt . Following the successful establishment of the PAH model , rats were r and omly assigned to three groups ( n=20 in each group ) : sham group ( control ) , PAH group , and BMSC group ( received a sublingual vein injection of 1 - 5 × 10(6 ) BMSCs ) . Two weeks after the administration , BMSCs significantly reduced the vascular remodeling , improved the hemodynamic data , and deceased the right ventricle weight ratio to left ventricular plus septal weight ( RV/LV+S ) ( P<0.05 ) . Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) and immunohistochemistry analysis results indicated that the inflammation factors such as interleukin-1β ( IL-1β ) , IL-6 , and tumor necrosis factor-α ( TNF-α ) were reduced ( P<0.05 ) ; the expression of matrix metallo proteinase-9 ( MMP-9 ) was lower ( P<0.05 ) ; vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) was higher in BMSC group than those in PAH group ( P<0.05 ) . CONCLUSION Sublingual vein injection of BMSCs for 2 weeks , significantly improved the lung and heart injury caused by left-to-right shunt-induced PAH ; decreased pulmonary vascular remodeling and inflammation ; and enhanced angiogenesis', 'Pulmonary arterial hypertension is a life-threatening disease for which continuous intravenous prostacyclin has proven to be effective . However , this treatment requires a permanent central venous catheter with the associated risk of serious complications such as sepsis , thromboembolism , or syncope . Treprostinil , a stable prostacyclin analogue , can be administered by a continuous subcutaneous infusion , avoiding these risks . We conducted a 12-week , double-blind , placebo-controlled multicenter trial in 470 patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension , either primary or associated with connective tissue disease or congenital systemic-to-pulmonary shunts .  Exercise capacity improved with treprostinil and was unchanged with placebo ; the between treatment group difference in median six-minute walking distance was 16 m ( p = 0.006 ) . Improvement in exercise capacity was greater in the sicker patients and was dose-related , but independent of disease etiology . Concomitantly , treprostinil significantly improved indices of dyspnea , signs and symptoms of pulmonary hypertension , and hemodynamics . The most common side effect attributed to treprostinil was infusion site pain ( 85 % ) leading to premature discontinuation from the study in 8 % of patients . Three patients in the treprostinil treatment group presented with an episode of gastrointestinal hemorrhage . We conclude that chronic subcutaneous infusion of treprostinil is an effective treatment with an acceptable safety profile in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension', 'BACKGROUND Endothelin 1 , a powerful endogenous vasoconstrictor and mitogen , might be a cause of pulmonary hypertension . We describe the efficacy and safety of bosentan , a dual endothelin-receptor antagonist that can be taken orally , in patients with severe pulmonary hypertension . METHODS In this double-blind , placebo-controlled study , 32 patients with pulmonary hypertension ( primary or associated with scleroderma ) were r and omly assigned to bosentan ( 62.5 mg taken twice daily for 4 weeks then 125 mg twice daily ) or placebo for a minimum of 12 weeks . The primary endpoint was change in exercise capacity . Secondary endpoints included changes in cardiopulmonary haemodynamics , Borg dyspnoea index , WHO functional class , and withdrawal due to clinical worsening . Analysis was by intention to treat . FINDINGS In patients given bosentan , the distance walked in 6 min improved by 70 m at 12 weeks compared with baseline , whereas it worsened by 6 m in those on placebo ( difference 76 m [ 95 % CI 12 - 139 ] , p=0.021 ) . The improvement was maintained for at least 20 weeks . The cardiac index was 1.0 L min(-1 ) m(-2 ) ( 95 % CI 0.6 - 1.4 , p<0.0001 ) greater in patients given bosentan than in those given placebo .  Pulmonary vascular resistance decreased by 223 dyn s cm(-)(5 ) with bosentan , but increased by 191 dyn s cm(-5 ) with placebo ( difference -415 [ -608 to -221 ] , p=0.0002 ) . Patients given bosentan had a reduced Borg dyspnoea index and an improved WHO functional class . All three withdrawals from clinical worsening were in the placebo group ( p=0.033 ) . The number and nature of adverse events did not differ between the two groups . INTERPRETATION Bosentan increases exercise capacity and improves haemodynamics in patients with pulmonary hypertension , suggesting that endothelin has an important role in pulmonary hypertension', 'Background Systematic Review s ( SRs ) of experimental animal studies are not yet common practice , but awareness of the merits of conducting such SRs is steadily increasing . As animal intervention studies differ from r and omized clinical trials ( RCT ) in many aspects , the methodology for SRs of clinical trials needs to be adapted and optimized for animal intervention studies . The Cochrane Collaboration developed a Risk of Bias ( RoB ) tool to establish consistency and avoid discrepancies in assessing the method ological quality of RCTs . A similar initiative is warranted in the field of animal experimentation . Methods We provide an RoB tool for animal intervention studies ( SYRCLE ’s RoB tool ) . This tool is based on the Cochrane RoB tool and has been adjusted for aspects of bias that play a specific role in animal intervention studies . To enhance transparency and applicability , we formulated signalling questions to facilitate judgment . Results The result ing RoB tool  for animal studies contains 10 entries . These entries are related to selection bias , performance bias , detection bias , attrition bias , reporting bias and other biases . Half these items are in agreement with the items in the Cochrane RoB tool . Most of the variations between the two tools are due to differences in design between RCTs and animal studies . Shortcomings in , or unfamiliarity with , specific aspects of experimental design of animal studies compared to clinical studies also play a role . Conclusions SYRCLE ’s RoB tool is an adapted version of the Cochrane RoB tool . Widespread adoption and implementation of this tool will facilitate and improve critical appraisal of evidence from animal studies . This may subsequently enhance the efficiency of translating animal research into clinical practice and increase awareness of the necessity of improving the method ological quality of animal studies']\""

The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether the introduction of ERAS care improved the adverse events in colorectal surgery . In a cohort study , mortality , morbidity , and length of stay were compared between ERAS patients and carefully matched historical controls . Methods Patients were matched for their type of disease , the type of surgery , P-Possum ( Portsmouth-Possum ) , CR-Possum ( Colorectal-Possum ) Physiological and Operative Score for Enumeration of Mortality and Morbidity ( POSSUM ) , gender , and American Society of Anesthesiologists ( ASA ) grade . The primary outcome measures of this study were mortality and morbidity . Secondary outcome measures were fluid intake , length of hospital stay , the number of relaparotomies , and the number of readmissions within 30 days . Data on the ERAS patients were collected prospect ively . Results Sixty-one patients treated according to the ERAS program were compared with 122 patients who received conventional postoperative care .  The two groups were comparable with respect to age , ASA grade , P-Possum ( Portsmouth-Possum ) , CR-Possum ( Colorectal-Possum ) score , type of surgery , stoma formation , type of disease , and gender . Morbidity was lower in the ERAS group compared to the control group ( 14.8 % versus 33.6 % respectively ; P = < 0.01 ) . Patients in the ERAS group received significantly less fluid and spent fewer days in the hospital ( median 6 days , range 3\\u201350 vs. median 9 days , range 3\\u2013138 ; P = 0.032 ) . There was no difference between the ERAS and the control group for mortality ( 0 % vs. 1.6 % ; P = 0.55 ) and readmission rate ( 3.3 % vs. 1.6 % ; P = 0.60 ) . Conclusion Enhanced Recovery After Surgery program  reduces morbidity and the length of hospital stay for patients undergoing elective colonic or rectal surgery', 'BACKGROUND Studies have shown the value of using fast-track postoperative recovery . St and ard procedures ( non-fast-track strategies ) remain in common use for perioperative care . Few prospect i ve reports exist on the outcome of fast-tracking in Central Europe . The aim of our study was to assess the effect and safety of our own fast-track protocol with regard to the postoperative period after open bowel resection . PATIENTS AND METHODS One hundred and five patients with ASA score I-II scheduled for open intestinal resection in the period April 2005-December 2007 were r and omly selected for the fast-track group ( FT ) and non-fast-track group ( non-FT ) . A design ed protocol was used in the FT group with the emphasis on an interdisciplinary approach . The control group ( non-FT ) was treated by st and ard established procedures .  Postoperative pain , rehabilitation , gastrointestinal functions , postoperative complications , and post-op length of stay were recorded . RESULTS Of 105 patients , 103 were statistically analyzed . Patients in the FT group ( n=51 ) and non-FT group ( n=52 ) did not differ in age , surgical diagnosis , or procedure . The fast-track procedure led to significantly better control of postoperative pain and faster restoration of GI functions ( bowel movement after 1.3 days vs. 3.1 , p<0.001 ) . Food tolerance was significantly better in the FT group and rehabilitation was also faster . Hospital stay was shorter in the FT group - median seven days ( 95 % CI 7.0 - 7.7 ) versus ten days ( 95 % CI 9.5 - 11.3 ) in non-FT ( p<0.001 ) . Postoperative complications within 30 postoperative days were also significantly lower in the FT group ( 21.6 vs. 48.1 % , p=0.003 ) . There were no deaths and no patients were readmitted within 30 days . CONCLUSIONS Following the FT protocol helped to reduce frequency of postoperative complications and reduced hospital stay . We conclude that the FT strategy is safe and effective in improving postoperative outcomes', 'The aim of this trial was to compare  multimodal optimization  with  conventional perioperative management  in a consecutive series of patients undergoing a wide range of colorectal procedures', 'Background : To evaluate the feasibility of a fast-track ( FT ) program and it \\u2019s effect on postoperative recovery . Methods : All patients , scheduled for elective segmental colorectal resection were treated in a FT program ( FT group ) . Data were compared to a control group operated for elective colorectal resections and treated in a traditional care program ( TC group ) . Data from the FT group were collected prospect ively , data from the TC group retrospectively . Outcome parameters included the number of successfully applied FT modalities , patient satisfaction , morbidity rate , re-operation rate , primary ( PHS ) and total hospital stay ( THS ) , and readmission rate . Results : One-hundred and seven patients were included ( 55 FT group vs. 52 TC group ) . The groups were comparable for patient characteristics such as age and cr-POSSUM score ( p = 0.22 and p = 0.40 ) . An average of 7.4 of 13 predefined FT modalities were successfully achieved per patient . Patient satisfaction was comparable ( p = 0.84 ) . Seven versus 5 patients required a re-operation in the FT and TC groups , respectively ( p = 0.52 ) . Morbidity rate was comparable ( n = 16 vs. 15 , p = 0.83 ) . Median PHS was 4.0 vs. 6.0 days and median THS was 4.0 vs. 6.5 days in the FT and TC groups ( p < 0.01 and p < 0.03 , respectively ) . Six vs. 3 patients were re-admitted in the FT and TC groups , respectively ( p = 0.49 ) . Conclusion : Implementation of all FT modalities was difficult since a rather low number of pre-defined FT modalities was effectively realized . Despite incomplete implementation , PHS and THS were shorter in the FT group without affecting patient satisfaction', 'Multimodal optimization of surgical care has been associated with reduced hospital stay and improved physical function . The aim of this r and omized trial was to compare multimodal optimization with st and ard care in patients undergoing colonic resection', 'Background  Laparoscopic colorectal resection improves patient outcome by reducing pain , postoperative pulmonary dysfunction , gastrointestinal paralysis , and fatigue . A multimodal rehabilitation program ( \\u201c fast-track \\u201d ) with epidural analgesia , early oral feeding , and enforced mobilization may further improve the excellent results of laparoscopic colorectal resection , enabling early ambulation of these patients . Methods Fifty two consecutive patients underwent laparoscopic sigmoidectomy with st and ardized regular perioperative treatment ( st and ard ) or multimodal rehabilitation program ( \\u201c fast-track \\u201d ) .  Outcome measures included pulmonary function , duration of postoperative ileus , pain perception , fatigue , morbidity , and mortality . Results Twenty nine st and ard-care patients ( 19 men and 10 women ) and 23 fast-track patients ( 15 men and eight women ) were evaluated . Demographic and operative data were similar for the two groups . On the 1st postoperative day , pulmonary function was improved ( p = 0.01 ) in fast-track patients . Oral feeding was achieved earlier ( p < 0.01 ) and defecation occurred earlier ( p < 0.01 ) in the fast-track group . Visual analogue scale scores for pain were similar for the two groups ( p > 0.05 ) , but fatigue was increased in the st and ard-care group on the 1st ( p = 0.06 ) and 2nd ( p < 0.05 ) postoperative days . Morbidity was not different for the two groups . Fast-track patients were discharged on day 4 ( range , 3\\u20136 ) and st and ard-care patients on day 7 ( range , 4\\u201314 ) ( p < 0.001 ) . Conclusion Multimodal rehabiliation can improve further on the excellent results of laparoscopic sigmoidectomy and decrease the postoperative hospital stay', 'OBJECTIVE To investigate the feasibility of a 48-hour postoperative stay program after colonic resection . SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA Postoperative hospital stay after colonic resection is usually 6 to 12 days , with a complication rate of 10 % to 20 % . Limiting factors for early recovery include stress-induced organ dysfunction , paralytic ileus , pain , and fatigue . It has been hypothesized that an accelerated multimodal rehabilitation program with optimal pain relief , stress reduction with regional anesthesia , early enteral nutrition , and early mobilization may enhance recovery and reduce the complication rate . METHODS Sixty consecutive patients undergoing elective colonic resection  were prospect ively studied using a well-defined postoperative care program including continuous thoracic epidural analgesia and enforced early mobilization and enteral nutrition , and a planned 48-hour postoperative hospital stay . Postoperative follow-up was scheduled at 8 and 30 days . RESULTS Median age was 74 years , with 20 patients in ASA group III-IV . Normal gastrointestinal function ( defecation ) occurred within 48 hours in 57 patients , and the median hospital stay was 2 days , with 32 patients staying 2 days after surgery . There were no cardiopulmonary complications . The readmission rate was 15 % , including two patients with anastomotic dehiscence ( one treated conservatively , one with colostomy ) ; other readmissions required only short-term observation . CONCLUSION A multimodal rehabilitation program may significantly reduce the postoperative hospital stay in high-risk patients undergoing colonic resection . Such a program may also reduce postoperative ileus and cardiopulmonary complications . These results may have important implication s for the care of patients after colonic surgery and in the future assessment of open versus laparoscopic colonic resection', 'Abstract INTRODUCTION : In an era of dwindling hospital re sources and increasing medical costs , safe reduction in postoperative stay has become a major focus to optimize utilization of healthcare re sources . Although several protocol s have been reported to reduce postoperative stay , no Level I evidence exists for their use in routine clinical practice . METHODS : Sixty-four patients undergoing laparotomy and intestinal or rectal resection  were r and omly assigned to a pathway of controlled rehabilitation with early ambulation and diet or to traditional postoperative care .  Time to discharge from hospital , complication and readmission rates , pain level , quality of life , and patient satisfaction scores were determined at the time of discharge and at 10 and 30 days after surgery . Subgroups were defined to evaluate those who derived the optimal benefit from the protocol . RESULTS : Pathway patients spent less total time in the hospital after surgery ( 5.4 vs. 7.1 days ; P = 0.02 ) and less time in the hospital during the primary admission than traditional patients . Patients younger than 70 years old had greater benefits than the overall study group ( 5 vs. 7.1 days ; P = 0.01 ) . Patients treated by surgeons with the most experience with the pathway spent significantly less time in the hospital than did those whose surgeons were less experienced with the pathway ( P = 0.01 ) . There was no difference between pathway and traditional patients for readmission or complication rates , pain score , quality of life after surgery , or overall satisfaction with the hospital stay . CONCLUSIONS : Patients scheduled for a laparotomy and major intestinal or rectal resection  are suitable for management by a pathway of controlled rehabilitation with early ambulation and diet . Pathway patients have a shorter hospital stay , with no adverse effect on patient satisfaction , pain scores , or complication rates . Patients younger than 70 years of age derive the optimal benefit , and increased surgeon experience improves outcome', 'Objective : A prospect i ve r and omized controlled trial ( RCT ) of multimodal perioperative management protocol in patients undergoing elective colorectal resection for cancer . Aims : This study evaluates the use of a multimodal package in colorectal cancer surgery in the context of an RCT . Methods : Patients for elective resection for colorectal cancer were offered trial entry . Participants were stratified by sex and requirement for a total mesorectal excision and central ly r and omized .  Multimodal patients received intravenous fluid restriction , unrestricted oral intake with prokinetic agents , early ambulation , and fixed regimen epidural analgesia . Control patients received intravenous fluids to prevent oliguria , restricted oral intake until return of bowel motility , and weaning regimen epidural analgesia . Adherence to both regimens was reinforced using a daily checklist and protocol guidance sheets . Discharge decision was made using preagreed criteria . The primary endpoint was postoperative stay , and achievement of independence milestones . Secondary endpoints were postoperative complications , readmission rates , and mortality . Analysis was by intention to treat . Results : Seventy patients were recruited . Approximately one fourth underwent TME . Median ages were similar ( 69.3 vs. 73.0 years ) . The median stay was significantly reduced in the multimodal group ( 5 vs. 7 days ; P < 0.001 , Mann-Whitney U test ) . Patients in the control arm were 2.5 times as likely to require a postoperative stay of more than 5 days . Patients in the multimodal group had less cardiorespiratory and anastomotic complications but more readmissions . There were 2 deaths , both controls . Conclusions : This RCT provides level 1b evidence that a multimodal management protocol can significantly reduce postoperative stay following colorectal cancer surgery . Morbidity and mortality are not increased', 'BACKGROUND Bowel preparation prior to colonic surgery usually includes antibiotic therapy together with mechanical bowel preparation ( MBP ) . Mechanical bowel preparation may cause discomfort to the patient , prolonged hospitalization , and water and electrolyte imbalance . It was assumed that with the improvement in surgical technique together with the use of more effective prophylactic antibiotics , it was possible that MBP would no longer be necessary . HYPOTHESIS There is no statistical difference in the postoperative results of patients who undergo elective colon resection with MBP  as compared with those who have no MBP . DESIGN AND PATIENTS The study includes all patients who had elective large bowel resection at Campus Golda between April 1 , 1999 , and March 31 , 2002 . Emergency operations were not included . The patients were r and omly assigned to the 2 study groups ( with or without MBP ) according to identification numbers . All patients were treated with intravenous and oral antibiotics prior to surgery . The patients in the MBP group received Soffodex for bowel preparation . RESULTS A total of 329 patients participated in the study , 165 without MBP and 164 with MBP . The 2 groups were similar in age , sex , and type of surgical procedure . Two hundred sixty-eight patients ( 81.5 % ) underwent surgery owing to colorectal cancer and 61 patients ( 18.5 % ) owing to benign disease . The hospitalization period was longer in the bowel-prepared group ( mean + /- SD , 8.2 + /- 5.1 days ) as compared with the nonprepared group ( mean + /- SD , 8.0 + /- 2.7 days ) . However , this difference was not statistically significant . The time until the first bowel movement was similar between the 2 groups : a mean + /- SD of 4.2 + /- 1.3 days in the nonprepared group as compared with a mean + /- SD of 4.3 + /- 1.1 days in the prepared group ( P = NS ) . Four patients ( 1.2 % ) died in the postoperative course owing to acute myocardial infa rct ion and pulmonary embolism . Sixty-two patients ( 37.6 % ) of the non-MBP group suffered from postoperative complications as compared with 77 patients ( 46.9 % ) of the MBP group . CONCLUSION Our results suggest that no advantage is gained by preoperative MBP in elective colorectal surgery', 'Recent studies have suggested that MBP does not lower the risk of postoperative septic complications after elective colorectal surgery . This r and omized clinical trial assessed whether preoperative MBP is beneficial in elective colonic surgery', 'PURPOSE : Despite the universal use of bowel preparation before colonoscopy and colorectal surgery , the physiologic effects have not been described in a st and ardized setting . This study was design ed to investigate the physiologic effects of bowel preparation . METHODS : In a prospect i ve study , 12 healthy volunteers ( median age , 63 years ) underwent bowel preparation with bisacodyl and sodium phosphate . Fluid and food intake were st and ardized according to weight , providing adequate calorie and oral fluid intake . Before and after bowel preparation , weight , exercise capacity , orthostatic tolerance , plasma and extracellular volume , balance function , and biochemical parameters were measured . RESULTS : Bowel preparation led to a significant decrease in exercise capacity ( median , 9 percent ) and weight ( median , 1.2 kg ) . Plasma osmolality was significantly increased from 287 to 290 mmol kg\\u22121 , as well as increased phosphate and urea concentrations , whereas calcium and potassium concentrations decreased significantly after bowel preparation . No differences in plasma or extracellular volumes were seen . Orthostatic tolerance and balance function did not change after bowel preparation . CONCLUSIONS : Bowel preparation has significant adverse physiologic effects , which may be attributed to dehydration . The majority of these findings is small and may not be of clinical relevance in otherwise healthy patients undergoing bowel preparation  and following recommendations for oral fluid intake', 'Postoperative organ dysfunction contributes to morbidity , hospital stay and convalescence . Multimodal rehabilitation with epidural analgesia , early oral feeding , mobilization and laxative use after colonic resection has reduced ileus and hospital stay']\",\n          \"['Inguinal hernias in women are relatively rare , and an outcome in this specific subgroup of hernias has not been documented in the literature . An analysis was performed using data from the prospect i ve recording of 3,696 female inguinal hernia repairs in the national Danish hernia data base , in the 5.5 year period from January 1 , 1998 to June 30 , 2003 , where observation time specific reoperation rates were used as a proxy for recurrence . In the 3,696 female inguinal herniorrhaphies recorded , the overall reoperation rate was 4.3 % , which is slightly higher compared to male inguinal herniorrhaphies  ( 3.1 % ) ( P=0.001 ) . The reoperation rate was independent of the type of surgical repair . In 41.5 % of the reoperations a femoral hernia was found , compared to 5.4 % in males . Female inguinal herniorrhaphy is followed by a higher reoperation rate than in males , and is unrelated to the type of repair . The frequent finding of a femoral hernia at reoperation suggests the need for the exploration of the femoral canal at the primary operation', 'The European Hernia Society ( EHS ) is proud to present the EHS Guidelines for the Treatment of  Inguinal Hernia in Adult Patients . The Guidelines contain recommendations for the treatment of inguinal hernia from diagnosis till aftercare . They have been developed by a Working Group consisting of expert surgeons with representatives of 14 country members of the EHS . They are evidence -based and , when necessary , a consensus was reached among all members . The Guidelines have been review ed by a Steering Committee . Before finalisation , feedback from different national hernia societies was obtained . The  Appraisal of Guidelines for REsearch and Evaluation ( AGREE ) instrument was used by the Cochrane Association to vali date the Guidelines . The Guidelines can be used to adjust local protocol s , for training purpose s and quality control . They will be revised in 2012 in order to keep them up date d. In between revisions , it is the intention of the Working Group to provide every year , during the EHS annual congress , a short up date of new high-level evidence ( r and omised controlled trials [ RCTs ] and meta-analyses ) . Developing guidelines leads to questions that remain to be answered by specific research . Therefore , we provide recommendations for further research that can be performed to raise the level of evidence concerning certain aspects of inguinal hernia treatment . In addition , a short summary , specifically for the general practitioner , is given . In order to increase the practical use of the Guidelines by consultants and residents , more details on the most important surgical techniques , local infiltration anaesthesia and a patient information sheet is provided . The most important challenge now will be the implementation of the Guidelines in daily surgical practice . This remains an important task for the EHS . The establishment of an EHS school for teaching inguinal hernia repair surgical techniques , including tips and tricks from experts to overcome the learning curve ( especially in endoscopic repair ) , will be the next step . Working together on this project was a great learning experience , and it was worthwhile and fun . Cultural differences between members were easily overcome by educating each other , respecting different views and always coming back to the principles of evidence -based medicine . The members of the Working Group would like to thank the EHS board for their support and especially Ethicon for sponsoring the many meetings that were needed to finalise such an ambitious project', 'BACKGROUND An association between smoking and impaired wound healing has been reported in retrospective studies . The smoking status of a surgical patient may be confounded by social and medical parameters . We have evaluated the effect of smoking in a test wound in volunteers , with special reference to a reliable scientific match between smokers and nonsmokers . METHODS In a prospect i ve open study with blinded assessment , 19 smoking ( 20 cigarettes/day ) and 18 nonsmoking healthy volunteers were matched with respect to baseline characteristics . The deposition of total protein and mature collagen ( expressed as hydroxyproline ) was assessed in an exp and ed polytetrafluoroethylene wound healing model implanted subcutaneously for 10 days . RESULTS The nonsmokers had a 1.8 times higher median amount of hydroxyproline than the smokers ( p < 0.01 ) . The deposition of hydroxyproline was negatively correlated with the consumption of tobacco both before ( r = -0.44 ; p < 0.01 ) and during the study ( r = -0.48 ; p < 0.005 ) . The impairment was specific for the production of collagenous proteins and not other proteins . CONCLUSIONS The synthesis of subcutaneous collagen in smokers is specifically impeded , indicating an impaired wound-healing process . Because mature collagen is the main determinator of strength of an operative wound , the results support the view that patients should be advised to stop smoking before an operation', 'Background Large-scale data for the optimal inguinal hernia repair in younger men with an indirect hernia is not available . We analysed nationwide data for risk of reoperation in younger men after a primary repair using a Lichtenstein operation or a conventional non-mesh hernia repair .  Methods Prospect i ve recording of all inguinal hernia repairs  from 1 January 1998 to 31 December 2005 in the national Danish Hernia Data base , using reoperation rate as a proxy for recurrence . We included only men between the age of 18 and 30 years with a primary repair of a primary indirect inguinal hernia . Results A primary sutured repair was performed in 1,120 men ( median age 23 years , range 18\\u201330 ) and a Lichtenstein mesh repair in 2,061 young men ( 24 years , range 18\\u201330 ) ( total 3,181 patients ) . The observation time after  conventional hernia repair  was median 62 months ( range 0\\u201396 ) and 41 months ( range 0\\u201396 ) after a Lichtenstein repair . The cumulative incidence of reoperation at 5 years was 1.6 % ( Lichtenstein ) versus 3.9 % ( sutured repair ) , while overall reoperation rates were almost three-fold as high after a sutured repair ( 39 reoperations , overall reoperation rate = 3.5 % ) compared to a Lichtenstein repair ( 24 reoperations , overall reoperation rate = 1.2 % ; P = 0.0003 ) . Conclusions Lichtenstein repair for an indirect inguinal hernia reduces the risk of recurrence in young men between the age of 18 and 30 years compared with a sutured repair . The use of a Lichtenstein mesh repair in young males must be balanced against the risk of chronic pain', 'Laparoscopic transperitoneal hernioplasty ( TAPP ) repair  of inguinal hernias is thought to be a difficult surgical technique with high complication rates . The present study evaluated TAPP based on prospect i ve documentation', 'BACKGROUND We sought to determine perioperative variables predictive of complications or recurrence for patients undergoing surgical repair of inguinal hernias . PATIENTS AND METHODS Using data from the Veterans Affairs trial , regression analyses were utilized to identify perioperative factors significantly associated with complications ( overall , short-term and long-term ) , long-term pain , and to develop a risk model for recurrence . RESULTS Recurrent and scrotal hernias were predictors for short term and overall complications , regardless of technique . Older age and higher Mental Component Score of the SF-36 were associated with higher risk of long term complications in the open group while prostatism and increased body mass index were the significant predictors in the laparoscopic group . Long-term pain complaints decreased as patient age increased in both groups . Patient and surgeon factors were predictive of recurrence but varied greatly depending on surgical technique . CONCLUSIONS Regardless of technique , scrotal and recurrent hernias were associated with a greater risk of complications and younger patients had more long-term pain . Predictors of recurrence vary based on surgical technique', 'Cigarette smokers deposit less collagen , expressed as hydroxyproline , in granulation tissue than nonsmokers . We studied the effect of abstinence from smoking and transdermal nicotine patches on deposition of hydroxyproline , proline , type I procollagen , and total proteins . Fifty-four healthy smokers were studied during 10 days of smoking and again from days 10 to 20 following smoking cessation . After the first 10 days of abstinence they were r and omized to double-blind treatment with transdermal nicotine patches of 25 mg/day or placebo for a period of 10 days . During this period and during smoking , an exp and ed polytetrafluoroethylene tube was implanted into the subcutis . Following removal of the implant , total amino acids and peptides were extracted . Hydroxyproline and proline were analyzed by high-pressure liquid chromatography , type I procollagen was analyzed by enzyme-linked immunoassay , and total proteins were determined colorimetrically . In the 39 subjects who complied with the study protocol , abstinence from smoking did not affect the deposition of hydroxyproline , proline , type I procollagen , or total protein in the implants . During abstinence , the type I procollagen level increased by 18 % in the transdermal nicotine patches group and decreased by 10 % in the placebo group ( p<0.05 ) . We conclude that 20 days of abstinence from smoking does not affect collagen deposition in granulation tissue . However , in abstinent smokers , transdermal nicotine patches appears to increase type I collagen synthesis', 'OBJECTIVE To establish a register of  inguinal hernia surgery  that allows audit and analyses of data from several centres . DESIGN Prospect i ve recording of data on a common protocol . SETTING Eight Swedish hospitals . SUBJECTS All groin hernia operations done for patients over 15 years old from January 1992 to December 1994 . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Methods of repair , postoperative complications including mortality , day surgery rate , and reoperations for recurrence . RESULTS During the three years studied 4879 hernia operations were undertaken in 4474 patients .  Postoperative mortality within 30 days of operation for emergency and elective hernia repairs was 3.5 % and 0.07 % , respectively . Of all herniorrhaphies 798 ( 16 % ) were done for recurrences , 142 of these after operations between 1992 and 1994 . At 24 months 4 % of all operations had been redone because of recurrences with highly significant variations among hospitals ranging from 1.5 % to 6.7 % . Postoperative complications within 30 days after operation , direct hernia , recurrent hernia , and the use of absorbable sutures were associated with an increased risk of reoperation . CONCLUSIONS A quality register recorded voluntarily can identify significant interhospital differences in outcome as well as variables associated with an increased risk of reoperation , thereby raising quality awareness and facilitating the process of improvement', 'Objective :  Inguinal  hernias are very common disorders , especially in men , with inguinal herniorrhaphy being one of the most frequently performed general surgical procedures in men . Theoretically , obesity might increase the risk of groin hernia by increasing intra-abdominal pressure . The objective of the present study was to investigate whether overweight and obesity in middle age could significantly predict future groin hernia  in men . Summary Background Data : Design : Prospect i ve cohort study ; Setting : General population of men living in Gothenburg , Sweden ; Participants : A community-based sample of 7483 men aged 47 to 55 years were followed-up from baseline ( 1970\\u20131973 ) for a maximum of 34 years . Main Outcome Measures : A diagnosis of groin hernia according to the Swedish hospital discharge register . Results : A total of 1017 men ( 13.6 % ) were diagnosed with groin hernia .  An inverse relationship was found between body mass index ( BMI ) and risk of groin hernia . With each BMI unit ( 3\\u20134 kg ) , the relative risk for groin hernia decreased by 4 % ( P < 0.0001 ) . Compared with men of normal weight , obese men had a 43 % lower risk ( P = 0.0008 , 95 % confidence interval 21%\\u201359 % ) . Heavy smokers demonstrated a 26 % lower risk for groin hernia ( P = 0.003 , 95 % confidence interval 10%\\u201339 % ) . Diabetes , high physical activity , and blood pressure were not associated with groin hernia . Entering other variables potentially associated with groin hernia , as age , BMI , smoking , and serum cholesterol , in a multivariable analysis left the risk estimates for BMI and smoking virtually unchanged . Conclusions : In a large community-based sample of middle-aged men overweight and obesity were associated with a lower risk for groin hernia during an extended follow-up . Obesity , in comparison with normal weight , reduced the risk of groin hernia by 43 % . A reduced risk of groin hernia was also noted in heavy smokers . Obviously , hernia may be more easily detected in lean men but a true protective effect can not be excluded', 'Background During totally extraperitoneal ( TEP ) endoscopic repair of inguinal hernias , it is possible to see the internal opening of the femoral canal . The aim of our study was to determine the incidence of synchronous femoral hernias found in patients undergoing TEP endoscopic inguinal hernia repair .  Method This was a retrospective review of prospect ively collected data on 362 consecutive patients who underwent 484 TEP endoscopic inguinal hernia repairs during a 5-year period , May 2005 to May 2010 . During surgery , both inguinal and femoral canal orifices were routinely inspected . The presence of unilateral or bilateral inguinal and femoral hernias was recorded and repaired accordingly . Results There were a total of 362 patients . More males ( 343 , 95 % ) underwent a TEP hernia repair than females ( 19 , 5 % ) . There were more cases of unilateral ( 240/362 , 66 % ) than bilateral ( 122/362 , 34 % ) inguinal hernias . A total of 18 cases of synchronous femoral hernias were found during operation . There was a higher incidence of femoral hernia in females ( 7/19 , 37 % ) compared to males ( 11/343 , 3 % ) ( P < 0.001 ) . None of the femoral hernias were clinical ly detectable preoperatively . Conclusion Females undergoing elective inguinal hernia repair are more likely to have a synchronous femoral hernia than males . We suggest that all women presenting with an inguinal hernia also have a formal assessment of the femoral canal . TEP endoscopic inguinal hernia repair is an ideal approach as both inguinal and femoral orifices can be assessed and hernias repaired simultaneously during surgery', 'Objective To analyze reoperation rates for recurrent and primary groin hernia repair documented in the Swedish Hernia Register from 1996 to 1998 , and to study variables associated with increased or decreased relative risks for reoperation after recurrent hernia . Methods Data were retrieved for all groin hernia repairs prospect ively recorded in the Swedish Hernia register from 1996 to 1998 . Actuarial analysis adjusted for patients \\u2019 death was used for calculating the cumulative incidence of reoperation . Relative risk for reoperation was estimated using the Cox proportional hazards model . Results From 1996 to 1998 , 17,985 groin hernia operations were recorded in the Swedish Hernia Register , 15 % for recurrent hernia and 85 % for primary hernia . At 24 months the risk for having had a reoperation was 4.6 % after recurrent hernia repair and 1.7 % after primary hernia repair . The relative risk for reoperation was significantly lower for laparoscopic methods and for anterior tension-free repair than for other techniques . Postoperative complications and direct hernia were associated with an increased relative risk for reoperation . Day-case surgery and local infiltration anesthesia were used less frequently for recurrent hernia than for primary hernia . Conclusions Recurrent groin hernia still constitutes a significant quantitative problem for the surgical community . This study supports the use of mesh by laparoscopy or anterior tension-free repair for recurrent hernia operations', 'OBJECTIVE To find out whether simultaneous repair of bilateral hernias increases the risk of recurrence compared with unilateral repair . DESIGN Prospect i ve study . SETTING Swedish hospitals participating in the Swedish Hernia Register ( SHR ) . INTERVENTIONS Prospect i ve collection of data from the SHR , 1992 - 1999 inclusive . The Cox proportional hazard test was used for calculating odds ratio ( OR ) . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES  Hernia repairs  were followed up in a life table fashion until re-operation for recurrence or death of the patient . RESULTS 33416 unilateral and 1487 bilateral operations on 2974 groin hernias were found .  Direct hernias were more common in the bilateral than in the unilateral group , 1,825 , 61 % compared with 13,336 , 40 % , ( p < 0.0001 ) . A laparoscopic method was used for 1774 ( 60 % ) of bilateral and 3285 ( 10 % ) unilateral repairs , and 455 bilateral operations ( 31 % ) were done as day cases compared with 18376 ( 55 % ) unilateral ones ( p < 0.0001 for both comparisons ) . The cumulative incidence of reoperation at three years for groin hernias after bilateral and unilateral repair was 4.1 % ( 95 % confidence interval 3.1 % to 5.1 % ) and 3.4 % ( 95 % Cl 3.1 % to 3.7 % , respectively . After adjustment for other risk factors , the OR for reoperation for recurrence after bilateral repair was 1.2 ( 95 % CI 0.9 to 1.5 ) with unilateral repair as reference . The OR for reoperation after laparoscopic bilateral repair compared with open bilateral repair was 0.9 ( 95 % CI 0.6 to 1.4 ) . CONCLUSIONS Simultaneous repair of bilateral hernias does not increase the risk of reoperation for recurrence and there is no significant difference in the risk of reoperation after bilateral repair using open or laparoscopic techniques', 'BACKGROUND We compare the use of unilateral and simultaneous bilateral laparoscopic hernioplasty [ transabdominal preperitoneal patch ( TAPP ) ] METHOD We employed a prospect i ve consecutive single-center trial lasting from April 1993 to December 2000 . RESULTS In our study , 5524 consecutive patients underwent 6860 laparoscopic hernia repairs . The median age in group A ( unilateral repair , n = 4188 ) was 58 years ( 16 - 94 years ) , and that in group B ( simultaneous bilateral repair , n = 1336 ) was 60 years ( 19 - 97 years ) in ( simultaneous bilateral repair  , n = 1336 ) . Morbidity in group A was 3.2 % ( 135/4188 ) with a 0.6 % reoperation rate ( 24/4188 ) ; in group B morbidity was 5.0 % ( 67/1336 ) with a 1.4 % reoperation rate . ( 19/1336 ) . Morbidity and reoperation rates showed no statistically significant difference between the two groups in relation to number of repairs in group B. After a median 24-month clinical follow-up period ( 1 - 84 months ) ( follow-up rate 93.1 % ) 38 recurrences were observed in group A ( 0.9 % ) and 17 in group B ( 0.6 % ; 17/2672 ) ( p = 0.2668 ) . Median time off work was 14 days after unilateral ( 2 - 63 days ) and 17 days after bilateral repair ( 3 - 100 days ) ( p = 0.1359 ) . Pain levels ( numerical analogue scale ) and incidence of persistent inguinal and scrotal pain are not higher after bilateral repair . CONCLUSION Compared to unilateral repair , bilateral simultaneous laparoscopic hernia repair ( TAPP ) is safe , comfortable for patients , and cost-effective , without increased morbidity or recurrence risk . Bilateral inguinal hernia is an ideal indication for endoscopic transabdominal repair', 'OBJECTIVES To examine the relationship between operating time and reoperation for recurrence and other complications in groin hernia repairs . DESIGN Observational population -based register study . SETTING Data from the nationwide Swedish Hernia Register , which prospect ively collects data from almost all groin hernia repairs performed in Sweden . PATIENTS There were 123,917 primary groin hernia repairs recorded in the Swedish Hernia Register from January 1 , 1998 , through December 31 , 2007 . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Relative risk of reoperation for recurrence and odds ratios for postoperative complications in 4 operating time groups . RESULTS The relative risk of reoperation for recurrence of all patients operated on in less than 36 minutes was 26 % higher than that of all patients with an operating time of more than 66 minutes ( 1.26 ; 95 % CI , 1.11 - 1.43 ) . Because the Lichtenstein procedure is the st and ard procedure in Sweden today , its results were also analyzed separately . In this homogeneous group , the difference was even more striking with an increased relative risk of 45 % ( 1.45 ; 95 % CI , 1.21 - 1.75 ) . The odds ratio for infection and other postoperative complications increased with increasing operating time . CONCLUSION A significant decrease in reoperation for recurrence with increasing operating time exhorts the hernia surgeon to avoid speed and to maintain thoroughness throughout the procedure', 'Objective : To describe the characteristics of patients undergoing multiple groin hernia repairs  and to identify strategies that prevent further recurrence . Summary Background Data : Although relatively infrequent , recurrent groin hernias where several repairs have previously been undertaken constitutes a major problem in hernia surgery . Low numbers and heterogeneity have made it difficult to perform large prospect i ve studies on this group . Methods : The study was design ed as an observational population -based register study . All repairs for recurrent hernia recorded in the Swedish Hernia Register ( SHR ) 1992\\u20132006 were identified . Risk for reoperation by number of previous repairs , with adjustment for gender and age , and risk for reoperation by unit responsible for previous repair were determined using Cox proportional hazard analysis . Results : There were 12,104 cases of hernia repaired once , 2 repairs in 4199 cases , 3 repairs in 310 cases , 4 repairs in 32 cases , and 5 repairs in 3 cases . The risk for further reoperation increased with the number of previous repairs ( P < 0.001 ) . The hazard ratios for reoperation following  open preperitoneal mesh repair and  laparoscopic repair  decreased ; whereas , the hazard ratio for sutured repair  increased with the number of previous repairs . The difference between Lichtenstein repair and laparoscopic repair was significant for the first 2 repairs ( P < 0.05 ) . Conclusion : Laparoscopic preperitoneal repair provides the best surgical outcome in repeated groin hernia recurrence', \\\"Objectives : We examined the influence of surgeon age and other factors on proficiency in laparoscopic or open hernia repair .  Summary Background Data : In a multicenter , r and omized trial comparing  open and laparoscopic herniorrhaphies  , conducted in Veterans Administration hospitals ( CSP 456 ) , we reported significant differences in recurrence rates ( RR ) for the laparoscopic procedure as a result of surgeons \\u2019 experience . We have also reported significant differences in RR for the open procedure related to resident postgraduate year ( PGY ) level . Methods : We analyzed data from unilateral laparoscopic and open herniorrhaphies from CSP 456 ( n = 1629 ) . Surgeon 's experience ( experienced \\u2265250 procedures ; inexperienced < 250 ) , surgeon 's age , median PGY level of the participating resident , operation time , and hospital observed-to-expected ( O/E ) ratios for mortality were potential independent predictors of RR . Results : Age was dichotomized into older ( \\u226545 years ) and younger ( < 45 years ) . Surgeon 's inexperience and older age were significant predictors of recurrence in laparoscopic herniorrhaphy . The odds of recurrence for an inexperienced surgeon aged 45 years or older was 1.72 times that of a younger inexperienced surgeon . For open repairs , although surgeon 's age and operation time appeared to be related to recurrence , only median PGY level of <3 was a significant independent predictor . Conclusion : This analysis demonstrates that surgeon 's age of 45 years and older , when combined with inexperience in laparoscopic inguinal herniorrhaphies , increases risk of recurrence . For open repairs , only a median PGY level of <3 was a significant risk factor\\\", 'OBJECTIVE Analysis of reoperation and recurrence rates three years after repair of groin hernias . DESIGN Prospect i ve audit by question naire and selective follow-up . SETTING Eight Swedish hospitals . SUBJECTS All groin hernia operations done during 1992 on patients between the ages of 15 and 80 years . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Postoperative complications , reoperation for recurrence , and recurrence . RESULTS During 1992 , 1565 hernia operations were done . The postoperative complication rate was 8 % ( 125/1565 ) . At 36 months postoperatively 108 recurrences had already been reoperated on , six patients with recurrences were on the waiting list for reoperation and a further 36 recurrences had been detected at follow-up . The interhospital variation in recurrence rate ranged from 3 % to 20 % . Postoperative complications , recurrent hernia , direct hernia and hospital catchment area over 100000 inhabitants were all factors associated with an increased relative risk of recurrence . CONCLUSIONS The recurrence rate exceeded the reoperation rate for recurrence by almost 40 % which should be taken into account if the reoperation rate is used as the endpoint after repairs of groin hernia . An audit scheme , based on prospect i ve recording , reoperation rate , and ( periodic ) calculation of the recurrence rate may be used to identify risk factors for recurrence and areas in need of improvement', 'BACKGROUND More than sixty thous and inguinal hernia operations are performed every year in Pol and . Despite many years of related research , the exact pathologic mechanism of this condition is still not fully understood . Recent studies suggested a pronounced relationship between the molecular structure of collagen fibers and the activity of metalloproteinases , the enzymes taking part in the degradation of collagen , as well as their tissue inhibitors . MATERIAL S AND METHODS A prospect i ve study has been established to measure serum levels of the matrix metalloproteinase 2 ( MMP-2 ) and Matrix metalloproteinase tissue inhibitor 2 ( TIMP-2 ) in 150 males between the ages of 26 and 70 . The control group ( CG ) consisted of thirty healthy male volunteers of a similar age distribution . RESULTS Our results indicate that MMP-2 was highest in the direct hernia group , a statistically very significant elevation ( P<0 ( . ) 05 ) of 1562ng mL(-1 ) against the CG 684ng mL(-1 ) . The highest level of TIMP , 78ng mL(-1 ) , was found in the group with recurrent hernia , against 49 ( . ) 5ng mL(-1 ) of the CG ( statistical significance of P<0 ( . ) 05 ) . DISCUSSION The MMP-2 and TIMP-2 levels were concurrently elevated only in the recurrent hernia group . CONCLUSIONS The patients with inguinal hernia have a statistically significant increase in serum levels of MMP-2 . Our finding of the MMP-2 and TIMP-2 distinctly higher in the patients suffering from recurrence of direct inguinal hernia ( reflecting a previous surgical failure ) may suggest the theory that the extracellular matrix defect lies at the basis of this disorder']\",\n          \"['BACKGROUND Heart failure treatment guidelines emphasize daily weight monitoring for patients with heart failure , but data to support this practice are lacking . Using a technology-based heart failure monitoring system , we determined whether daily reporting of weight and symptoms in patients with advanced heart failure would reduce rehospitalization and mortality rates despite aggressive guideline -driven heart failure care . METHODS This was a r and omized , controlled trial . Patients hospitalized with New York Heart Association class III or IV heart failure , with a left ventricular ejection fraction < or = 35 % were r and omized to receive heart failure program care or heart failure program care plus the AlereNet system ( Alere Medical , Reno , Nev ) and followed-up for 6 months . The primary end point was 6-month hospital readmission rate . Secondary end points included mortality , heart failure hospitalization readmission rate , emergency room visitation rate , and quality of life . RESULTS Two hundred eighty patients from 16 heart failure centers across the United States were r and omized : 138 received the  AlereNet system and 142 received st and ard care .  Mean age was 59 + /- 15 years and 68 % were male . The population had very advanced heart failure , New York Heart Association class III ( 75 % ) or IV ( 25 % ) , as evidence d by serum norepinepherine levels , 6-minute walk distance and outcomes .  No differences in hospitalization rates were observed . There was a 56.2 % reduction in mortality ( P < .003 ) for patients r and omized to the AlereNet group . CONCLUSIONS This is the largest multicenter , r and omized trial of a technology-based daily weight and symptom-monitoring system for patients with advanced heart failure . Despite no difference in the primary end point of rehospitalization rates , mortality was significantly reduced for patients r and omized to the AlereNet system without an increase in utilization , despite specialized and aggressive heart failure care in both groups', 'Background \\u2014 Heart failure is associated with frequent hospitalizations , often result ing from volume overload . Measurement of intrathoracic impedance with an implanted device with an audible patient alert may detect increases in pulmonary fluid retention early . We hypothesized that early intervention could prevent hospitalizations and affect outcome . Methods and Results \\u2014 We studied 335 patients with chronic heart failure who had undergone implantation of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator alone ( 18 % ) or with cardiac resynchronization therapy ( 82 % ) . All devices featured a monitoring tool to track changes in intrathoracic impedance ( OptiVol ) and other diagnostic parameters . Patients were r and omized to have information available to physicians and patients as an audible alert in case of preset threshold crossings ( access arm ) or not ( control arm ) . The primary end point was a composite of all-cause mortality and heart failure hospitalizations . During 14.9\\u00b15.4 months , this occurred in 48 patients ( 29 % ) in the access arm and in 33 patients ( 20 % ) in the control arm ( P=0.063 ; hazard ratio , 1.52 ; 95 % confidence interval , 0.97\\u20132.37 ) . This was due mainly to more heart failure hospitalizations ( hazard ratio , 1.79 ; 95 % confidence interval , 1.08\\u20132.95 ; P=0.022 ) , whereas the number of deaths was comparable ( 19 versus 15 ; P=0.54 ) . The number of outpatient visits was higher in the access arm ( 250 versus 84 ; P<0.0001 ) , with relatively more signs of heart failure among control patients during outpatient visits . Although the trial was terminated as a result of slow enrollment , a post hoc futility analysis indicated that a positive result would have been unlikely . Conclusion \\u2014 Use of an implantable diagnostic tool to measure intrathoracic impedance with an audible patient alert did not improve outcome and increased heart failure hospitalizations and outpatient visits in heart failure patients .

Unique identifier : NCT 00480077', 'AIMS To evaluate the utility of intrathoracic impedance monitoring for detecting  heart failure ( HF ) deterioration in patients with an implanted cardiac resynchronization/defibrillation device . METHODS AND RESULTS Patients enrolled in the European InSync Sentry Observational Study were audibly alerted by a device algorithm if a decrease in intrathoracic impedance suggested fluid accumulation . Clinical HF status and device data were assessed at enrolment , during regular follow-up , and if patients presented with an alert or HF deterioration .  Data from 373 subjects were analysed . Fifty-three alert events and a total of 53 clinical events ( HF deterioration defined by worsening of HF signs and symptoms ) were reported during a median of 4.2 months . Adjusted for multiple events per patient , the alert detected clinical HF deterioration with 60 % sensitivity ( 95 % CI 46 - 73 ) and with a positive predictive value of 60 % ( 95 % CI 46 - 73 ) . Higher NYHA class at baseline was predictive for adequate alert events during follow-up ( P < 0.05 ) . In 11 of 20 HF deteriorations without preceding alert , an upstroke of the fluid index occurred without reaching the programmed alert threshold . CONCLUSION A device-based algorithm that alerts patients in case of decreasing intrathoracic impedance facilitates the detection of HF deterioration . Future r and omized , controlled trials are needed to test whether the tailored use of intrathoracic impedance monitoring can improve the ambulatory management of patients with chronic HF and an implanted device', 'Acute heart failure syndromes ( AHFS ) represent the most common discharge diagnoses in adults over age 65 and translate into dramatically increased heart failure \\u2013 associated morbidity and mortality . Conventional approaches to the early detection of pulmonary and systemic congestion have been shown to be of limited sensitivity . Despite their proven efficacy , disease management and structured telephone support programs have failed to achieve widespread use in part due to their re source intensiveness and reliance upon motivated patients . While once thought to hold great promise , results from recent prospect i ve studies on telemonitoring strategies have proven disappointing . Implantable devices with their capacity to monitor electrophysiologic and hemodynamic parameters over long periods of time and with minimal reliance on patient participation may provide solutions to some of these problems . Conventional electrophysiologic parameters and intrathoracic impedance data are currently available in the growing population of heart failure patients with equipped devices . A variety of implantable hemodynamic monitors are currently under investigation . How best to integrate these devices into a systematic approach to the management of patients before , during , and after AHFS  is yet to be established', 'OBJECTIVES We sought to identify whether home telemonitoring ( HTM ) improves outcomes compared with nurse telephone support ( NTS ) and usual care ( UC ) for patients with heart failure who are at high risk of hospitalization or death . BACKGROUND Heart failure is associated with a high rate of hospitalization and poor prognosis . Telemonitoring could help implement and maintain effective therapy and detect worsening heart failure and its cause promptly to prevent medical crises . METHODS Patients with a recent admission for heart failure and left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) < 40 % were assigned r and omly to HTM , NTS , or UC in a 2:2:1 ratio . HTM consisted of twice-daily patient self-measurement of weight , blood pressure , heart rate , and rhythm with automated devices linked to a cardiology center . The NTS consisted of specialist nurses who were available to patients by telephone . Primary care physicians delivered UC . The primary end point was days dead or hospitalized with NTS versus HTM at 240 days . RESULTS Of 426 patients r and omly assigned , 48 % were aged > 70 years , mean LVEF was 25 % ( SD , 8) and median plasma N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide was 3,070 pg/ml ( interquartile range 1,285 to 6,749 pg/ml ) . During 240 days of follow-up , 19.5 % , 15.9 % , and 12.7 % of days were lost as the result of death or hospitalization for UC , NTS , and HTM , respectively ( no significant difference ) . The number of admissions and mortality were similar among patients r and omly assigned to NTS or HTM , but the mean duration of admissions was reduced by 6 days ( 95 % confidence interval 1 to 11 ) with HTM . Patients r and omly assigned to receive UC had higher one-year mortality ( 45 % ) than patients assigned to receive NTS ( 27 % ) or HTM ( 29 % ) ( p = 0.032 ) . CONCLUSIONS Further investigation and refinement of the application of HTM are warranted because it may be a valuable role for the management of selected patients with heart failure', 'BACKGROUND We performed a prospect i ve , r and omized investigation assessing the incremental effect of automated health monitoring ( AHM ) technology over and above that of a previously described nurse directed heart failure ( HF ) disease management program . The AHM system measured and transmitted body weight , blood pressure , and heart rate data as well as subjective patient self- assessment s via a st and ard telephone line to a central server . METHODS AND RESULTS A total of 188 consented and eligible patients were r and omized between intervention and control groups in 1:1 ratio . Subjects r and omized to the control arm received the Specialized Primary and Networked Care in Heart Failure ( SPAN-CHF ) heart failure disease management program . Subjects r and omized to the intervention arm received the SPAN-CHF disease management program in conjunction with the AHM system . The primary end point was prespecified as the relative event rate of HF hospitalization between intervention and control groups at 90 days . The relative event rate of HF hospitalization for the intervention group compared with controls was 0.50 ( 95%CI [ 0.25 - 0.99 ] , P = .05 ) . CONCLUSIONS Short-term reductions in the heart failure hospitalization rate were associated with the use of automated home monitoring equipment . Long-term benefits in this model remain to be studied', 'BACKGROUND Heart failure is a common and important cause of morbidity and mortality . Disease management offers promise in reducing the need for hospitalization and improving quality of life for heart failure patients , but experimental data on the efficacy of such programs are limited . METHODS AND RESULTS A total of 151 patients hospitalized with heart failure were r and omized to usual care or scheduled telephone calls by specially trained nurses promoting self-management and guideline -based therapy as prescribed by primary physicians . Nurses also screened patients for heart failure exacerbations , which they managed with supplemental diuretics or by contacting the primary physician for instructions . Outcomes included time to hospital encounter , mortality , number and cost of hospitalizations , functional status , and satisfaction with care . Intervention patients had a longer time to encounter ( hazard ratio [ HR ] = 0.67 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 0.47 - 0.96 ; P = .029 ) , hospital readmission ( HR = 0.67 ; CI 0.46 - 0.99 ; P = .045 ) , and heart failure-specific readmission ( HR = 0.62 ; CI 0.38 - 1.03 ; P = .063 ) . The number of admissions , hospital days , and hospital costs were significantly lower during the first 6 months after intervention but not at 1 year . The intervention had little effect on functional status , mortality , and satisfaction with care . CONCLUSION A nurse-administered , telephone-based disease management program delayed subsequent health care encounters , but had minimal impact on other outcomes', 'BACKGROUND This trial was design ed to determine whether cardiac-resynchronization therapy ( CRT ) with biventricular pacing would reduce the risk of death or heart-failure events in patients with mild cardiac symptoms , a reduced ejection fraction , and a wide QRS complex . METHODS During a 4.5-year period , we enrolled and followed 1820 patients with ischemic or nonischemic cardiomyopathy , an ejection fraction of 30 % or less , a QRS duration of 130 msec or more , and New York Heart Association class I or II symptoms . Patients were r and omly assigned in a 3:2 ratio to receive CRT plus an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator ( ICD ) ( 1089 patients ) or an ICD alone ( 731 patients ) . The primary end point was death from any cause or a nonfatal heart-failure event ( whichever came first ) . Heart-failure events were diagnosed by physicians who were aware of the treatment assignments , but they were adjudicated by a committee that was unaware of assignments . RESULTS During an average follow-up of 2.4 years , the primary end point occurred in 187 of 1089 patients in the CRT-ICD group ( 17.2 % ) and 185 of 731 patients in the ICD-only group ( 25.3 % ) ( hazard ratio in the CRT-ICD group , 0.66 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.52 to 0.84 ; P=0.001 ) . The benefit did not differ significantly between patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy and those with nonischemic cardiomyopathy . The superiority of CRT was driven by a 41 % reduction in the risk of heart-failure events , a finding that was evident primarily in a prespecified subgroup of patients with a QRS duration of 150 msec or more . CRT was associated with a significant reduction in left ventricular volumes and improvement in the ejection fraction . There was no significant difference between the two groups in the overall risk of death , with a 3 % annual mortality rate in each treatment group . Serious adverse events were infrequent in the two groups . CONCLUSIONS CRT combined with ICD decreased the risk of heart-failure events in relatively asymptomatic patients with a low ejection fraction and wide QRS complex . ( Clinical Trials.gov number , NCT00180271 .', 'Purpose The aim of the present study is to evaluate if remote monitoring with the CareLink Network may improve clinical management of tachyarrhythmias and heart failure episodes in patients treated with biventricular defibrillators ( CRT-D ) .  Methods Patients implanted with CRT-D for more than 6 months received the CareLink monitor and were trained to perform device interrogation . At-home transmissions were scheduled at 2 weeks , 1 and 2 months after training , with a final in-office visit after 3 months . Results Sixty-seven patients performed 264 data transmissions . Twenty-three unscheduled data transmissions were requested by the centers after patient contact . Ventricular tachyarrhythmias were reported in nine patients during 16 data review s. Thirteen data review s ( 81 % ) were performed remotely via CareLink transmissions ( nine scheduled and four unscheduled ) , in seven patients . Of these events , in two cases ( 15 % ) in-hospital visits were requested , while in 11 ( 85 % ) no action was needed and no additional in-clinic visits were scheduled . During the study period , in 20/28 ( 71 % ) intra-thoracic impedance alerts , the patients remotely transmitted their device data . After remote data review , in ten cases drug therapy was adjusted by phone and in four cases no action was needed and the patient reassured . In six episodes an in-hospital extra visit was scheduled . On the whole , in 14 cases ( 70 % ) , the patient could be managed remotely avoiding a visit to the hospital . Conclusions Our study showed that remote follow-up is an efficient method to manage tachyarrhythmias and heart failure episodes in  CRT-D patients . Early reaction to clinical events may improve overall patient care', 'Changes in intrathoracic impedance ( Z ) leading to crossing of a derived fluid index ( FI ) threshold has been associated with heart failure ( HF ) hospitalization . The authors developed a remote monitoring program as part of HF disease management and prospect ively examined the feasibility and re source utilization of monitoring individuals with an implanted device capable of measuring Z. An HF nurse analyzed all transmitted data daily , as they were routinely uploaded as part of quarterly remote device monitoring , and called the patient if the FI crossed the threshold ( arbitrarily defined at 60 Omega ) to identify clinical ly relevant events ( CREs ) that occurred during this period ( eg , worsening dyspnea or increase in edema or weight ) . A total of 400 uploads were completed during the 4-month study period . During this period , 34 patients ( 18 % ) had an FI threshold crossing , averaging 0.52 FI threshold crossings per patient-year . Thirty-two of 34 patients contacted by telephone ( 94 % ) with FI threshold crossing had evidence of CREs during this period . However , only 6 ( 18 % ) had HF hospitalizations , 19 ( 56 % ) had reported changes in HF therapy , and 13 ( 38 % ) reported drug and /or dietary plan nonadherence . The average data analysis time required was 30 min daily when focusing on those with FI threshold crossing , averaging 8 uploads for review per working day and 5 telephone follow-ups per week . Our pilot observations suggested that Internet-based remote monitoring of Z trends from existing device interrogation uploads is feasible as part of a daily routine of HF disease management', 'BACKGROUND Previous studies have demonstrated that intrathoracic impedance monitoring ( IIM ) is associated with fluid overload . However , it remains unclear whether this new technology can predict heart failure ( HF ) before deterioration . Whether fluid status based on IIM predicts HF in patients with left ventricular ( LV ) systolic dysfunction was investigated . METHODS AND RESULTS A prospect i ve clinical observational study of 123 patients implanted with IIM-capable cardiac devices  was carried out . The primary endpoint was the positive predictive value ( PPV ) at 12 months . Secondary endpoints were a correlation between onset of HF and IIM , optimal threshold of fluid index and duration between the alert and HF . Complete follow-up clinical data were obtained from 111 patients . During the observational period , 168 alerts were confirmed from 68 patients . In patient-based analysis ( alert-based analysis ) , PPV was 33.8 % ( 33.9 % ) . Sensitivity , specificity and false positive was 67.6 % ( 83.8 % ) , 49.4 % ( 28.4 % ) and 50.6 % ( 71.6 % ) , respectively . Mean duration between the alert and HF event was 21.4 \\u00b1 6.1 days . On multivariate logistic analysis , maximum fluid index , LV ejection fraction and atrial fibrillation were independent predictors of HF events . The optimal cut-off value determined by receiver operating characteristic curve was 114-ohm\\u00b7day with sensitivity and specificity of 89.5 % and 73.0 % , respectively . CONCLUSIONS IIM-based fluid index in patients with HF due to LV systolic dysfunction was effective in predicting worsening HF', 'Purpose To determine the association between device-determined diagnostic indices , including intrathoracic impedance , and heart failure ( HF ) hospitalization . Methods Clinical and device diagnostic data of 558 HF patients indicated for CRT-D therapy ( In Sync Sentry , Medtronic Inc. ) were prospect ively collected from 34 centers . Device-recorded intrathoracic impedance fluid index threshold crossing event ( TCE ) , mean activity counts , tachyarrhythmia events , night heart rate ( NHR ) and heart rate variability ( HRV ) were compared within patients with vs. without documented HF hospitalization . Results Mean follow-up was 326 \\u00b1 216 days . Patients hospitalized for HF had significantly higher rates of TCE , a higher percentage of days with the thoracic impedance fluid index above the programmed threshold , a higher percentage of days with low activity , with low HRV or with high NHR.Multivariate analysis showed that TCE result ed in a 36 % increased probability of HF hospitalization . Both TCE duration and patient activity were also significantly associated with hospitalization . Kaplan Meier analysis indicated that patients with more TCE events were significantly more likely to be hospitalized ( log rank test , p = 0.005 ) . Conclusions Decreased intrathoracic impedance , low patient activity and low HRV were all independently associated with increased risk for HF hospitalization in HF patients treated with resynchronization therapy . Device-derived diagnostic data may provide valuable and reliable indices for the prognostic stratification of HF patients', \\\"OBJECTIVES The primary objective was to determine if wireless remote monitoring with automatic clinician alerts reduces the time from a clinical event to a clinical decision in response to arrhythmias , cardiovascular ( CV ) disease progression , and device issues compared to patients receiving st and ard in-office care . A secondary objective was to compare the rates of CV health care utilization between patients in the remote and in-office arms . BACKGROUND In addition to providing life-saving therapy , implantable cardioverter-defibrillators collect advanced diagnostics on the progression of the patient 's heart disease . Device technology has progressed to allow wireless remote monitoring with automatic clinician alerts to replace some scheduled in-office visits . METHODS The CONNECT ( Clinical Evaluation of Remote Notification to Reduce Time to Clinical Decision ) study was a multicenter , prospect i ve , r and omized evaluation involving 1,997 patients from 136 clinical sites who underwent insertion of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator ( including cardiac resynchronization therapy devices ) and were followed up for 15 months . Health care utilization data included all CV-related hospitalizations , emergency department visits , and clinic office visits . RESULTS The median time from clinical event to clinical decision per patient was reduced from 22 days in the in-office arm to 4.6 days in the remote arm ( p < 0.001 ) . The health care utilization data revealed a decrease in mean length of stay per CV hospitalization visit from 4.0 days in the in-office arm to 3.3 days in the remote arm ( p = 0.002 ) . CONCLUSIONS Wireless remote monitoring with automatic clinician alerts as compared with st and ard in-office follow-up significantly reduced the time to a clinical decision in response to clinical events and was associated with a significant reduction in mean length of CV hospital stay .

Continuous impedance measurement via implantable devices may detect pulmonary fluid accumulation due to worsening CHF . An acoustic alert might allow an earlier treatment of impending decompensation . An algorithm that implemented impedance measurement into clinical decision making in treating CHF patients was evaluated . METHODS Forty-two CHF patients ( ejection fraction : 27 + /- 6 % ; New York Heart Association 2.9 + /- 0.6 ) with cardiac resynchronization therapy and automatic impedance measurements were included . Upon an alert , a stepped therapy was initiated : category ( 1 ) overt decompensation , hospitalization ; category ( 2 ) worsened CHF , increase of diuretics ; category ( 3 ) no CHF worsening , brain natriuretic peptide ( BNP ) measurement , elevated BNP : increase of diuretics , normal BNP : no specific treatment . RESULTS During 18 + /- 4 months , 45 alerts were treated according to the algorithm . Eleven category 1 alerts led to hospitalization ; 21 category 2 and 11 category 3 patients ( elevated BNP ) were treated conservatively . Two category 3 alerts ( normal BNP ) received no treatment . CONCLUSIONS Automatic impedance measurement can be integrated into CHF management . BNP measurement restricted to patients with alert but without clinical signs of worsened CHF may prevent premature therapy escalation', 'The purpose of this r and omized field study was to determine the effects of telehomecare on hospitalization , emergency department ( ED ) use , mortality , and symptoms related to sodium and fluid intake , medication use , and physical activity . The sample consists of 284 patients with heart failure . The authors used logistic regression to study the effects of telehomecare on health services utilization and mortality and a general linear model to analyze changes in self-reported symptoms . On average , patients in the telehomecare groups had a lower probability of hospitalizations and ED visits than did patients in the control group . Differences were statistically significant at 60 days but not 120 days . Results show a greater reduction in symptoms for patients using telehomecare compared to control patients . The technology enables frequent monitoring of clinical indices and permits the home health care nurse to detect changes in cardiac status and intervene when necessary', 'PURPOSE Some implantable cardioverter-defibrillators ( ICDs ) are now able to monitor intrathoracic impedance . The aim of the study was to describe the use of such monitoring in clinical practice and to evaluate the clinical impact of the fluid accumulation alert feature of these ICDs . METHODS AND RESULTS Five hundred thirty-two heart failure ( HF ) patients implanted with these ICDs  were followed up for 11 + /- 7 months . A clinical event ( CE ) was deemed to have occurred if it result ed in hospitalization or milder manifestations of HF deterioration . Three hundred sixty-two acute decreases in intrathoracic impedance ( Z events ) occurred in 230 patients . Of these episodes , 171 ( 47 % ) were associated with a CE within 2 weeks of the Z event . In another 71 ( 20 % ) Z events , drug therapy was adjusted despite the absence of overt signs of clinical deterioration . The rate of unexplained Z events was 0.25 per patient-year and 25 hospitalizations were not associated with Z events . The audible alert was disabled in a group of 102 patients ( OFF group ) .  HF hospitalizations occurred in 29 ( 7 % ) patients in the ON group and 20 ( 20 % , P < 0.001 ) patients in the OFF group . The rate of combined cardiac death and HF hospitalization was lower in patients with Alert ON ( log-rank test , P = 0.007 ) . CONCLUSIONS The ICD reliably detected CE and yielded low rates of unexplained and undetected events . The alert capability seemed to reduce the number of HF hospitalizations by allowing timely detection and therapeutic intervention', 'AIMS Early recognition of impending decompensation and timely intervention may prevent heart failure ( HF ) hospitalization . We investigated the performance of OptiVol \\u00ae intrathoracic fluid monitoring for the prediction of HF events in chronic HF patients newly implanted with a device ( implantable cardioverter-defibrillator with or without cardiac resynchronization therapy ) . METHODS AND RESULTS SENSE-HF was a prospect i ve , multi-centre study that enrolled 501 patients . Phase I ( double blinded , 6 months ) determined the sensitivity and positive predictive value ( PPV ) of the OptiVol data in predicting HF hospitalizations . Of 58 adjudicated HF hospitalizations that occurred during the first 6 months in Phase I , 12 were predicted by OptiVol ( sensitivity = 20.7 % ) . Sensitivity appeared to be dynamic in nature and at the end of Phase I , had increased to 42.1 % . With 253 OptiVol detections , PPV for Phase I was 4.7 % . Phase II/III ( unblinded , 18 months ) determined the PPV of the first OptiVol Patient Alert for detection of worsening HF status with signs and /or symptoms of pulmonary congestion . A total of 233 patients noted such an OptiVol alert and for 210 , HF status was evaluated within 30 days . Heart failure status had worsened for 80 patients ( PPV = 38.1 % ) . CONCLUSIONS An intrathoracic impedance-derived fluid index had low sensitivity and PPV in the early period after implantation of a device in chronic HF patients  . Sensitivity improved within the first 6 months after implant . Further studies are needed to assess the place of this monitoring technology in the clinical management of patients with HF', 'OBJECTIVES We sought to determine the utility of combined heart failure ( HF ) device diagnostic information to predict clinical deterioration of HF in patients with systolic left ventricular dysfunction . BACKGROUND Some implantable devices continuously monitor HF device diagnostic information , but data are limited on the ability of combined HF device diagnostics to predict HF events . METHODS The PARTNERS HF ( Program to Access and Review Trending Information and Evaluate Correlation to Symptoms in Patients With Heart Failure ) was a prospect i ve , multicenter observational study in patients receiving cardiac resynchronization therapy ( CRT ) implantable cardioverter-defibrillators .  HF events were independently adjudicated . A combined HF device diagnostic algorithm was developed on an independent data set . The algorithm was considered positive if a patient had 2 of the following abnormal criteria during a 1-month period : long atrial fibrillation duration , rapid ventricular rate during atrial fibrillation , high ( > or = 60 ) fluid index , low patient activity , abnormal autonomics ( high night heart rate or low heart rate variability ) , or notable device therapy ( low CRT pacing or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator shocks ) , or if they only had a very high ( > or = 100 ) fluid index . We used univariate and multivariable analyses to determine predictors of subsequent HF events within a month . RESULTS We analyzed data from 694 CRT defibrillator patients who were followed for 11.7 + /- 2 months . Ninety patients had 141 adjudicated HF  hospitalizations with pulmonary congestion  at least 60 days after implantation . Patients with a positive combined HF device diagnostics had a 5.5-fold increased risk of HF hospitalization with pulmonary signs or symptoms within the next month ( hazard ratio : 5.5 , 95 % confidence interval : 3.4 to 8.8 , p < 0.0001 ) , and the risk remained high after adjusting for clinical variables ( hazard ratio : 4.8 , 95 % confidence interval : 2.9 to 8.1 , p < 0.0001 ) . CONCLUSIONS Monthly review of HF device diagnostic data identifies patients at a higher risk of HF hospitalizations within the subsequent month .

The Fluid Accumulation Status Trial ( FAST ) prospect ively followed 156 HF patients with implanted cardioverter-defibrillator or cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator devices modified to record daily changes in intrathoracic impedance in a blinded fashion for 537\\u00b1312 days .  Daily impedance changes were used to calculate a fluid index that could be compared with a prespecified threshold . True positives were defined as adjudicated episodes of worsening HF occurring within 30 days of a fluid index above threshold or an acute weight gain . Unexplained detections were defined as threshold crossings or acute weight gains not associated with worsening HF . Impedance measurements were performed on > 99 % of follow-up days , compared with only 76 % of days for weight measurements . Sixty-five HF events occurred during follow-up ( 0.32/patient-year ) . Forty HF events were detected by impedance but not weight , whereas 5 were detected by weight but not impedance . Sensitivity was greater ( 76 % vs 23 % ; P<.0001 ) and unexplained detection rate was lower ( 1.9 vs 4.3/patient-year ; P<.0001 ) for intrathoracic impedance monitoring at the threshold of 60\\u03a9 days compared with acute weight increases of 3 lbs in 1 day or 5 lbs in 3 days and also over a wide range of fluid index and weight thresholds . The sensitivity and unexplained detection rate  of intrathoracic  impedance monitoring was superior to that seen for acute weight changes . Intrathoracic impedance monitoring represents a useful adjunctive clinical tool for managing HF in patients with implanted devices']\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"target\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2016,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"CONCLUSIONS The effects of treatment with clomipramine and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs : fluvoxamine , sertraline , fluoxetine , citalopram , and escitalopram ) proved to be similar , except for the lower adherence rate in case of clomipramine because of its side effects .\",\n          \"We found that female sex , direct inguinal hernias at the primary procedure , operation for a recurrent inguinal hernia , and smoking were significant risk factors for recurrence after inguinal hernia surgery .\",\n          \"RESULTS Device diagnostics showed strong correlation with established HF biomarkers and hemodynamic measures .\\nThe findings from this review indicate that device diagnostic parameters predict impending HF much earlier than traditional methods of monitoring do .\\nDevice diagnostics are also more accurate in the early prediction of HF when compared with noninvasive objective measures , particularly when multiple parameters are combined and monitored for trends .\\nDevice diagnostics possess a distinct advantage over traditional methods of monitoring for HF because they allow clinicians to remotely monitor the status of their HF patients without relying on patient compliance for data entry and reporting .\\nStudies regarding the efficacy of device diagnostic parameters suggest that their integration into clinical practice will provide a more accurate and reliable mechanism for assisting clinicians in risk stratifying and predicting potential episodes of decompensated HF\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"background\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1977,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Aims Investigations on the possible effect of the Nordic diet ( ND ) on the glycemic control and the risk of diabetes have led to inconsistent results .\\nThe present study tried to determine the effect of the ND on the markers of blood glucose control using a systematic review and meta- analysis of r and omized controlled clinical trials ( RCTs ) .\",\n          \"STUDY DESIGN A systematic literature review of outcome question naires design ed for assessing functional status or disability in patients with low back pain .\\nOBJECTIVES To provide a comprehensive overview of all functioning/disability question naires used in recent years and to explore how the main concept(s ) was described or defined in the original paper , the content or the domains of disability , and the measurement properties of the question naires .\\nSUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA A number of clinical tools design ed for evaluating the functional status of patients with low back pain have been developed .\\nOnly a few have been review ed earlier , and there has been little focus on the content reflected in the question naires .\",\n          \"Background The effects of increasing high-density lipoprotein cholesterol on cardiovascular outcomes remain uncertain .\\nDesign We conducted a meta- analysis to investigate the effects of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol modifiers ( niacin , fibrates and cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibitors ) on cardiovascular outcomes .\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"extractive_abstract\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2018,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \" Background Enhanced Recovery After Surgery ( ERAS ) programs are associated with reduced hospital morbidity and mortality . The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether the introduction of ERAS care improved the adverse events in colorectal surgery . In a cohort study , mortality , morbidity , and length of stay were compared between ERAS patients and carefully matched historical controls . The primary outcome measures of this study were mortality and morbidity . Secondary outcome measures were fluid intake , length of hospital stay , the number of relaparotomies , and the number of readmissions within 30 days . Data on the ERAS patients were collected prospect ively . Results Sixty-one patients treated according to the ERAS program were compared with 122 patients who received conventional postoperative care . Morbidity was lower in the ERAS group compared to the control group ( 14.8 % versus 33.6 % respectively ; P = < 0.01 ) . There was no difference between the ERAS and the control group for mortality ( 0 % vs. 1.6 % ; P = 0.55 ) and readmission rate ( 3.3 % vs. 1.6 % ; P = 0.60 ) . Conclusion Enhanced Recovery After Surgery program  reduces morbidity and the length of hospital stay for patients undergoing elective colonic or rectal surgery. ABSTRACT  BACKGROUND Studies have shown the value of using fast-track postoperative recovery . St and ard procedures ( non-fast-track strategies ) remain in common use for perioperative care . Few prospect i ve reports exist on the outcome of fast-tracking in Central Europe . A design ed protocol was used in the FT group with the emphasis on an interdisciplinary approach . The control group ( non-FT ) was treated by st and ard established procedures . Postoperative pain , rehabilitation , gastrointestinal functions , postoperative complications , and post-op length of stay were recorded . RESULTS Of 105 patients , 103 were statistically analyzed . Patients in the FT group ( n=51 ) and non-FT group ( n=52 ) did not differ in age , surgical diagnosis , or procedure . Food tolerance was significantly better in the FT group and rehabilitation was also faster . There were no deaths and no patients were readmitted within 30 days . CONCLUSIONS Following the FT protocol helped to reduce frequency of postoperative complications and reduced hospital stay . We conclude that the FT strategy is safe and effective in improving postoperative outcomes. ABSTRACT  The aim of this trial was to compare  multimodal optimization  with  conventional perioperative management  in a consecutive series of patients undergoing a wide range of colorectal procedures. ABSTRACT  Background : To evaluate the feasibility of a fast-track ( FT ) program and it \\u2019s effect on postoperative recovery . Methods : All patients , scheduled for elective segmental colorectal resection were treated in a FT program ( FT group ) . Data were compared to a control group operated for elective colorectal resections and treated in a traditional care program ( TC group ) . Data from the FT group were collected prospect ively , data from the TC group retrospectively . Results : One-hundred and seven patients were included ( 55 FT group vs. 52 TC group ) . The groups were comparable for patient characteristics such as age and cr-POSSUM score ( p = 0.22 and p = 0.40 ) . An average of 7.4 of 13 predefined FT modalities were successfully achieved per patient . Patient satisfaction was comparable ( p = 0.84 ) . Seven versus 5 patients required a re-operation in the FT and TC groups , respectively ( p = 0.52 ) . Morbidity rate was comparable ( n = 16 vs. 15 , p = 0.83 ) . Six vs. 3 patients were re-admitted in the FT and TC groups , respectively ( p = 0.49 ) . Conclusion : Implementation of all FT modalities was difficult since a rather low number of pre-defined FT modalities was effectively realized . Despite incomplete implementation , PHS and THS were shorter in the FT group without affecting patient satisfaction. ABSTRACT  Multimodal optimization of surgical care has been associated with reduced hospital stay and improved physical function . The aim of this r and omized trial was to compare multimodal optimization with st and ard care in patients undergoing colonic resection. ABSTRACT  Outcome measures included pulmonary function , duration of postoperative ileus , pain perception , fatigue , morbidity , and mortality . Demographic and operative data were similar for the two groups . On the 1st postoperative day , pulmonary function was improved ( p = 0.01 ) in fast-track patients . Oral feeding was achieved earlier ( p < 0.01 ) and defecation occurred earlier ( p < 0.01 ) in the fast-track group . Morbidity was not different for the two groups . Fast-track patients were discharged on day 4 ( range , 3\\u20136 ) and st and ard-care patients on day 7 ( range , 4\\u201314 ) ( p < 0.001 ) . Conclusion Multimodal rehabiliation can improve further on the excellent results of laparoscopic sigmoidectomy and decrease the postoperative hospital stay. ABSTRACT  OBJECTIVE To investigate the feasibility of a 48-hour postoperative stay program after colonic resection . Limiting factors for early recovery include stress-induced organ dysfunction , paralytic ileus , pain , and fatigue . Postoperative follow-up was scheduled at 8 and 30 days . RESULTS Median age was 74 years , with 20 patients in ASA group III-IV . There were no cardiopulmonary complications . Such a program may also reduce postoperative ileus and cardiopulmonary complications .. ABSTRACT  Although several protocol s have been reported to reduce postoperative stay , no Level I evidence exists for their use in routine clinical practice . Subgroups were defined to evaluate those who derived the optimal benefit from the protocol . Patients younger than 70 years old had greater benefits than the overall study group ( 5 vs. 7.1 days ; P = 0.01 ) . Patients treated by surgeons with the most experience with the pathway spent significantly less time in the hospital than did those whose surgeons were less experienced with the pathway ( P = 0.01 ) . There was no difference between pathway and traditional patients for readmission or complication rates , pain score , quality of life after surgery , or overall satisfaction with the hospital stay . CONCLUSIONS : Patients scheduled for a laparotomy and major intestinal or rectal resection  are suitable for management by a pathway of controlled rehabilitation with early ambulation and diet . Pathway patients have a shorter hospital stay , with no adverse effect on patient satisfaction , pain scores , or complication rates . Patients younger than 70 years of age derive the optimal benefit , and increased surgeon experience improves outcome. ABSTRACT  Adherence to both regimens was reinforced using a daily checklist and protocol guidance sheets . Discharge decision was made using preagreed criteria . The primary endpoint was postoperative stay , and achievement of independence milestones . Secondary endpoints were postoperative complications , readmission rates , and mortality . Analysis was by intention to treat . Results : Seventy patients were recruited . Approximately one fourth underwent TME . Median ages were similar ( 69.3 vs. 73.0 years ) . Patients in the multimodal group had less cardiorespiratory and anastomotic complications but more readmissions . There were 2 deaths , both controls . Morbidity and mortality are not increased. ABSTRACT  Emergency operations were not included . All patients were treated with intravenous and oral antibiotics prior to surgery . The patients in the MBP group received Soffodex for bowel preparation . RESULTS A total of 329 patients participated in the study , 165 without MBP and 164 with MBP . The 2 groups were similar in age , sex , and type of surgical procedure . However , this difference was not statistically significant . CONCLUSION Our results suggest that no advantage is gained by preoperative MBP in elective colorectal surgery. ABSTRACT  Recent studies have suggested that MBP does not lower the risk of postoperative septic complications after elective colorectal surgery . This r and omized clinical trial assessed whether preoperative MBP is beneficial in elective colonic surgery. ABSTRACT  This study was design ed to investigate the physiologic effects of bowel preparation . Fluid and food intake were st and ardized according to weight , providing adequate calorie and oral fluid intake . No differences in plasma or extracellular volumes were seen . Orthostatic tolerance and balance function did not change after bowel preparation . CONCLUSIONS : Bowel preparation has significant adverse physiologic effects , which may be attributed to dehydration .. ABSTRACT  Postoperative organ dysfunction contributes to morbidity , hospital stay and convalescence .\",\n          \" Inguinal hernias in women are relatively rare , and an outcome in this specific subgroup of hernias has not been documented in the literature . The reoperation rate was independent of the type of surgical repair . In 41.5 % of the reoperations a femoral hernia was found , compared to 5.4 % in males . Female inguinal herniorrhaphy is followed by a higher reoperation rate than in males , and is unrelated to the type of repair . The frequent finding of a femoral hernia at reoperation suggests the need for the exploration of the femoral canal at the primary operation. ABSTRACT  The European Hernia Society ( EHS ) is proud to present the EHS Guidelines for the Treatment of  Inguinal Hernia in Adult Patients . The Guidelines contain recommendations for the treatment of inguinal hernia from diagnosis till aftercare . They have been developed by a Working Group consisting of expert surgeons with representatives of 14 country members of the EHS . They are evidence -based and , when necessary , a consensus was reached among all members . The Guidelines have been review ed by a Steering Committee . Before finalisation , feedback from different national hernia societies was obtained . The  Appraisal of Guidelines for REsearch and Evaluation ( AGREE ) instrument was used by the Cochrane Association to vali date the Guidelines . The Guidelines can be used to adjust local protocol s , for training purpose s and quality control . Developing guidelines leads to questions that remain to be answered by specific research . In addition , a short summary , specifically for the general practitioner , is given . The most important challenge now will be the implementation of the Guidelines in daily surgical practice . This remains an important task for the EHS . Working together on this project was a great learning experience , and it was worthwhile and fun .. ABSTRACT  BACKGROUND An association between smoking and impaired wound healing has been reported in retrospective studies . The smoking status of a surgical patient may be confounded by social and medical parameters . We have evaluated the effect of smoking in a test wound in volunteers , with special reference to a reliable scientific match between smokers and nonsmokers . RESULTS The nonsmokers had a 1.8 times higher median amount of hydroxyproline than the smokers ( p < 0.01 ) . The impairment was specific for the production of collagenous proteins and not other proteins . CONCLUSIONS The synthesis of subcutaneous collagen in smokers is specifically impeded , indicating an impaired wound-healing process .. ABSTRACT  Background Large-scale data for the optimal inguinal hernia repair in younger men with an indirect hernia is not available . We analysed nationwide data for risk of reoperation in younger men after a primary repair using a Lichtenstein operation or a conventional non-mesh hernia repair . We included only men between the age of 18 and 30 years with a primary repair of a primary indirect inguinal hernia . The observation time after  conventional hernia repair  was median 62 months ( range 0\\u201396 ) and 41 months ( range 0\\u201396 ) after a Lichtenstein repair . Conclusions Lichtenstein repair for an indirect inguinal hernia reduces the risk of recurrence in young men between the age of 18 and 30 years compared with a sutured repair . The use of a Lichtenstein mesh repair in young males must be balanced against the risk of chronic pain. ABSTRACT  The present study evaluated TAPP based on prospect i ve documentation. ABSTRACT  BACKGROUND We sought to determine perioperative variables predictive of complications or recurrence for patients undergoing surgical repair of inguinal hernias . RESULTS Recurrent and scrotal hernias were predictors for short term and overall complications , regardless of technique . Long-term pain complaints decreased as patient age increased in both groups . Patient and surgeon factors were predictive of recurrence but varied greatly depending on surgical technique . CONCLUSIONS Regardless of technique , scrotal and recurrent hernias were associated with a greater risk of complications and younger patients had more long-term pain . Predictors of recurrence vary based on surgical technique. ABSTRACT  Cigarette smokers deposit less collagen , expressed as hydroxyproline , in granulation tissue than nonsmokers . We studied the effect of abstinence from smoking and transdermal nicotine patches on deposition of hydroxyproline , proline , type I procollagen , and total proteins . Fifty-four healthy smokers were studied during 10 days of smoking and again from days 10 to 20 following smoking cessation . During this period and during smoking , an exp and ed polytetrafluoroethylene tube was implanted into the subcutis . Following removal of the implant , total amino acids and peptides were extracted . We conclude that 20 days of abstinence from smoking does not affect collagen deposition in granulation tissue . However , in abstinent smokers , transdermal nicotine patches appears to increase type I collagen synthesis. ABSTRACT  OBJECTIVE To establish a register of  inguinal hernia surgery  that allows audit and analyses of data from several centres . DESIGN Prospect i ve recording of data on a common protocol . SETTING Eight Swedish hospitals . RESULTS During the three years studied 4879 hernia operations were undertaken in 4474 patients . Of all herniorrhaphies 798 ( 16 % ) were done for recurrences , 142 of these after operations between 1992 and 1994 .. ABSTRACT  Objective :  Inguinal  hernias are very common disorders , especially in men , with inguinal herniorrhaphy being one of the most frequently performed general surgical procedures in men . Theoretically , obesity might increase the risk of groin hernia by increasing intra-abdominal pressure . Main Outcome Measures : A diagnosis of groin hernia according to the Swedish hospital discharge register . Results : A total of 1017 men ( 13.6 % ) were diagnosed with groin hernia . An inverse relationship was found between body mass index ( BMI ) and risk of groin hernia . With each BMI unit ( 3\\u20134 kg ) , the relative risk for groin hernia decreased by 4 % ( P < 0.0001 ) . Compared with men of normal weight , obese men had a 43 % lower risk ( P = 0.0008 , 95 % confidence interval 21%\\u201359 % ) . Heavy smokers demonstrated a 26 % lower risk for groin hernia ( P = 0.003 , 95 % confidence interval 10%\\u201339 % ) . Diabetes , high physical activity , and blood pressure were not associated with groin hernia . Obesity , in comparison with normal weight , reduced the risk of groin hernia by 43 % . A reduced risk of groin hernia was also noted in heavy smokers . Obviously , hernia may be more easily detected in lean men but a true protective effect can not be excluded. ABSTRACT  During surgery , both inguinal and femoral canal orifices were routinely inspected . The presence of unilateral or bilateral inguinal and femoral hernias was recorded and repaired accordingly . Results There were a total of 362 patients . More males ( 343 , 95 % ) underwent a TEP hernia repair than females ( 19 , 5 % ) . There were more cases of unilateral ( 240/362 , 66 % ) than bilateral ( 122/362 , 34 % ) inguinal hernias . A total of 18 cases of synchronous femoral hernias were found during operation . None of the femoral hernias were clinical ly detectable preoperatively . Conclusion Females undergoing elective inguinal hernia repair are more likely to have a synchronous femoral hernia than males . We suggest that all women presenting with an inguinal hernia also have a formal assessment of the femoral canal .. ABSTRACT  Methods Data were retrieved for all groin hernia repairs prospect ively recorded in the Swedish Hernia register from 1996 to 1998 . Actuarial analysis adjusted for patients \\u2019 death was used for calculating the cumulative incidence of reoperation . Relative risk for reoperation was estimated using the Cox proportional hazards model . At 24 months the risk for having had a reoperation was 4.6 % after recurrent hernia repair and 1.7 % after primary hernia repair . The relative risk for reoperation was significantly lower for laparoscopic methods and for anterior tension-free repair than for other techniques . Postoperative complications and direct hernia were associated with an increased relative risk for reoperation . Day-case surgery and local infiltration anesthesia were used less frequently for recurrent hernia than for primary hernia . Conclusions Recurrent groin hernia still constitutes a significant quantitative problem for the surgical community . This study supports the use of mesh by laparoscopy or anterior tension-free repair for recurrent hernia operations. ABSTRACT  OBJECTIVE To find out whether simultaneous repair of bilateral hernias increases the risk of recurrence compared with unilateral repair . DESIGN Prospect i ve study . SETTING Swedish hospitals participating in the Swedish Hernia Register ( SHR ) . INTERVENTIONS Prospect i ve collection of data from the SHR , 1992 - 1999 inclusive . The Cox proportional hazard test was used for calculating odds ratio ( OR ) . RESULTS 33416 unilateral and 1487 bilateral operations on 2974 groin hernias were found . The OR for reoperation after laparoscopic bilateral repair compared with open bilateral repair was 0.9 ( 95 % CI 0.6 to 1.4 ) .. ABSTRACT  RESULTS In our study , 5524 consecutive patients underwent 6860 laparoscopic hernia repairs . ( 19/1336 ) . Bilateral inguinal hernia is an ideal indication for endoscopic transabdominal repair. ABSTRACT  OBJECTIVES To examine the relationship between operating time and reoperation for recurrence and other complications in groin hernia repairs . DESIGN Observational population -based register study . SETTING Data from the nationwide Swedish Hernia Register , which prospect ively collects data from almost all groin hernia repairs performed in Sweden . PATIENTS There were 123,917 primary groin hernia repairs recorded in the Swedish Hernia Register from January 1 , 1998 , through December 31 , 2007 . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Relative risk of reoperation for recurrence and odds ratios for postoperative complications in 4 operating time groups . Because the Lichtenstein procedure is the st and ard procedure in Sweden today , its results were also analyzed separately . In this homogeneous group , the difference was even more striking with an increased relative risk of 45 % ( 1.45 ; 95 % CI , 1.21 - 1.75 ) . The odds ratio for infection and other postoperative complications increased with increasing operating time .. ABSTRACT  Objective : To describe the characteristics of patients undergoing multiple groin hernia repairs  and to identify strategies that prevent further recurrence . Low numbers and heterogeneity have made it difficult to perform large prospect i ve studies on this group . Methods : The study was design ed as an observational population -based register study . All repairs for recurrent hernia recorded in the Swedish Hernia Register ( SHR ) 1992\\u20132006 were identified . The risk for further reoperation increased with the number of previous repairs ( P < 0.001 ) . The difference between Lichtenstein repair and laparoscopic repair was significant for the first 2 repairs ( P < 0.05 ) . Conclusion : Laparoscopic preperitoneal repair provides the best surgical outcome in repeated groin hernia recurrence. ABSTRACT  Objectives : We examined the influence of surgeon age and other factors on proficiency in laparoscopic or open hernia repair . We have also reported significant differences in RR for the open procedure related to resident postgraduate year ( PGY ) level . Methods : We analyzed data from unilateral laparoscopic and open herniorrhaphies from CSP 456 ( n = 1629 ) . Results : Age was dichotomized into older ( \\u226545 years ) and younger ( < 45 years ) . Surgeon 's inexperience and older age were significant predictors of recurrence in laparoscopic herniorrhaphy . The odds of recurrence for an inexperienced surgeon aged 45 years or older was 1.72 times that of a younger inexperienced surgeon . For open repairs , only a median PGY level of <3 was a significant risk factor. ABSTRACT  OBJECTIVE Analysis of reoperation and recurrence rates three years after repair of groin hernias . DESIGN Prospect i ve audit by question naire and selective follow-up . SETTING Eight Swedish hospitals . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Postoperative complications , reoperation for recurrence , and recurrence . RESULTS During 1992 , 1565 hernia operations were done . The postoperative complication rate was 8 % ( 125/1565 ) . The interhospital variation in recurrence rate ranged from 3 % to 20 % .. ABSTRACT  05 ) of 1562ng mL(-1 ) against the CG 684ng mL(-1 ) . 5ng mL(-1 ) of the CG ( statistical significance of P<0 ( . ) 05 ) . DISCUSSION The MMP-2 and TIMP-2 levels were concurrently elevated only in the recurrent hernia group .\",\n          \" BACKGROUND Heart failure treatment guidelines emphasize daily weight monitoring for patients with heart failure , but data to support this practice are lacking . METHODS This was a r and omized , controlled trial . The primary end point was 6-month hospital readmission rate . Mean age was 59 + /- 15 years and 68 % were male . No differences in hospitalization rates were observed . There was a 56.2 % reduction in mortality ( P < .003 ) for patients r and omized to the AlereNet group .. ABSTRACT  We hypothesized that early intervention could prevent hospitalizations and affect outcome . All devices featured a monitoring tool to track changes in intrathoracic impedance ( OptiVol ) and other diagnostic parameters . The primary end point was a composite of all-cause mortality and heart failure hospitalizations . Clinical Trial Registration \\u2014 URL : http://www . clinical trials.gov . Unique identifier : NCT 00480077. ABSTRACT  Clinical HF status and device data were assessed at enrolment , during regular follow-up , and if patients presented with an alert or HF deterioration . Data from 373 subjects were analysed . Higher NYHA class at baseline was predictive for adequate alert events during follow-up ( P < 0.05 ) . In 11 of 20 HF deteriorations without preceding alert , an upstroke of the fluid index occurred without reaching the programmed alert threshold . CONCLUSION A device-based algorithm that alerts patients in case of decreasing intrathoracic impedance facilitates the detection of HF deterioration .. ABSTRACT  Conventional approaches to the early detection of pulmonary and systemic congestion have been shown to be of limited sensitivity . While once thought to hold great promise , results from recent prospect i ve studies on telemonitoring strategies have proven disappointing . Conventional electrophysiologic parameters and intrathoracic impedance data are currently available in the growing population of heart failure patients with equipped devices . A variety of implantable hemodynamic monitors are currently under investigation . How best to integrate these devices into a systematic approach to the management of patients before , during , and after AHFS  is yet to be established. ABSTRACT  BACKGROUND Heart failure is associated with a high rate of hospitalization and poor prognosis . Telemonitoring could help implement and maintain effective therapy and detect worsening heart failure and its cause promptly to prevent medical crises . HTM consisted of twice-daily patient self-measurement of weight , blood pressure , heart rate , and rhythm with automated devices linked to a cardiology center . The NTS consisted of specialist nurses who were available to patients by telephone . Primary care physicians delivered UC . The primary end point was days dead or hospitalized with NTS versus HTM at 240 days . During 240 days of follow-up , 19.5 % , 15.9 % , and 12.7 % of days were lost as the result of death or hospitalization for UC , NTS , and HTM , respectively ( no significant difference ) . CONCLUSIONS Further investigation and refinement of the application of HTM are warranted because it may be a valuable role for the management of selected patients with heart failure. ABSTRACT  METHODS AND RESULTS A total of 188 consented and eligible patients were r and omized between intervention and control groups in 1:1 ratio . Subjects r and omized to the intervention arm received the SPAN-CHF disease management program in conjunction with the AHM system . The primary end point was prespecified as the relative event rate of HF hospitalization between intervention and control groups at 90 days . The relative event rate of HF hospitalization for the intervention group compared with controls was 0.50 ( 95%CI [ 0.25 - 0.99 ] , P = .05 ) . CONCLUSIONS Short-term reductions in the heart failure hospitalization rate were associated with the use of automated home monitoring equipment . Long-term benefits in this model remain to be studied. ABSTRACT  BACKGROUND Heart failure is a common and important cause of morbidity and mortality . Nurses also screened patients for heart failure exacerbations , which they managed with supplemental diuretics or by contacting the primary physician for instructions . Outcomes included time to hospital encounter , mortality , number and cost of hospitalizations , functional status , and satisfaction with care . The number of admissions , hospital days , and hospital costs were significantly lower during the first 6 months after intervention but not at 1 year . The intervention had little effect on functional status , mortality , and satisfaction with care . CONCLUSION A nurse-administered , telephone-based disease management program delayed subsequent health care encounters , but had minimal impact on other outcomes. ABSTRACT  The primary end point was death from any cause or a nonfatal heart-failure event ( whichever came first ) . Heart-failure events were diagnosed by physicians who were aware of the treatment assignments , but they were adjudicated by a committee that was unaware of assignments . The benefit did not differ significantly between patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy and those with nonischemic cardiomyopathy . CRT was associated with a significant reduction in left ventricular volumes and improvement in the ejection fraction . There was no significant difference between the two groups in the overall risk of death , with a 3 % annual mortality rate in each treatment group . Serious adverse events were infrequent in the two groups . ( Clinical Trials.gov number , NCT00180271 .. ABSTRACT  Methods Patients implanted with CRT-D for more than 6 months received the CareLink monitor and were trained to perform device interrogation . At-home transmissions were scheduled at 2 weeks , 1 and 2 months after training , with a final in-office visit after 3 months . Results Sixty-seven patients performed 264 data transmissions . Twenty-three unscheduled data transmissions were requested by the centers after patient contact . Of these events , in two cases ( 15 % ) in-hospital visits were requested , while in 11 ( 85 % ) no action was needed and no additional in-clinic visits were scheduled . During the study period , in 20/28 ( 71 % ) intra-thoracic impedance alerts , the patients remotely transmitted their device data . In six episodes an in-hospital extra visit was scheduled . On the whole , in 14 cases ( 70 % ) , the patient could be managed remotely avoiding a visit to the hospital . Conclusions Our study showed that remote follow-up is an efficient method to manage tachyarrhythmias and heart failure episodes in  CRT-D patients . Early reaction to clinical events may improve overall patient care. ABSTRACT  Changes in intrathoracic impedance ( Z ) leading to crossing of a derived fluid index ( FI ) threshold has been associated with heart failure ( HF ) hospitalization . A total of 400 uploads were completed during the 4-month study period . During this period , 34 patients ( 18 % ) had an FI threshold crossing , averaging 0.52 FI threshold crossings per patient-year . Thirty-two of 34 patients contacted by telephone ( 94 % ) with FI threshold crossing had evidence of CREs during this period . However , only 6 ( 18 % ) had HF hospitalizations , 19 ( 56 % ) had reported changes in HF therapy , and 13 ( 38 % ) reported drug and /or dietary plan nonadherence . Our pilot observations suggested that Internet-based remote monitoring of Z trends from existing device interrogation uploads is feasible as part of a daily routine of HF disease management. ABSTRACT  BACKGROUND Previous studies have demonstrated that intrathoracic impedance monitoring ( IIM ) is associated with fluid overload . However , it remains unclear whether this new technology can predict heart failure ( HF ) before deterioration . The primary endpoint was the positive predictive value ( PPV ) at 12 months . Secondary endpoints were a correlation between onset of HF and IIM , optimal threshold of fluid index and duration between the alert and HF . Complete follow-up clinical data were obtained from 111 patients . During the observational period , 168 alerts were confirmed from 68 patients . In patient-based analysis ( alert-based analysis ) , PPV was 33.8 % ( 33.9 % ) . Sensitivity , specificity and false positive was 67.6 % ( 83.8 % ) , 49.4 % ( 28.4 % ) and 50.6 % ( 71.6 % ) , respectively . Mean duration between the alert and HF event was 21.4 \\u00b1 6.1 days .. ABSTRACT  Purpose To determine the association between device-determined diagnostic indices , including intrathoracic impedance , and heart failure ( HF ) hospitalization . Results Mean follow-up was 326 \\u00b1 216 days . Both TCE duration and patient activity were also significantly associated with hospitalization . Kaplan Meier analysis indicated that patients with more TCE events were significantly more likely to be hospitalized ( log rank test , p = 0.005 ) . Conclusions Decreased intrathoracic impedance , low patient activity and low HRV were all independently associated with increased risk for HF hospitalization in HF patients treated with resynchronization therapy . Device-derived diagnostic data may provide valuable and reliable indices for the prognostic stratification of HF patients. ABSTRACT  A secondary objective was to compare the rates of CV health care utilization between patients in the remote and in-office arms . BACKGROUND In addition to providing life-saving therapy , implantable cardioverter-defibrillators collect advanced diagnostics on the progression of the patient 's heart disease . Device technology has progressed to allow wireless remote monitoring with automatic clinician alerts to replace some scheduled in-office visits . Health care utilization data included all CV-related hospitalizations , emergency department visits , and clinic office visits . RESULTS The median time from clinical event to clinical decision per patient was reduced from 22 days in the in-office arm to 4.6 days in the remote arm ( p < 0.001 ) . ( Clinical Evaluation of Remote Notification to Reduce Time to Clinical Decision [ CONNECT ] ; NCT00402246 ). ABSTRACT  BACKGROUND Hospitalizations due to decompensation are a frequent problem in treating patients with congestive heart failure ( CHF ) . Continuous impedance measurement via implantable devices may detect pulmonary fluid accumulation due to worsening CHF . An acoustic alert might allow an earlier treatment of impending decompensation . An algorithm that implemented impedance measurement into clinical decision making in treating CHF patients was evaluated . RESULTS During 18 + /- 4 months , 45 alerts were treated according to the algorithm . Two category 3 alerts ( normal BNP ) received no treatment . CONCLUSIONS Automatic impedance measurement can be integrated into CHF management .. ABSTRACT  The sample consists of 284 patients with heart failure . On average , patients in the telehomecare groups had a lower probability of hospitalizations and ED visits than did patients in the control group . Differences were statistically significant at 60 days but not 120 days . Results show a greater reduction in symptoms for patients using telehomecare compared to control patients .. ABSTRACT  PURPOSE Some implantable cardioverter-defibrillators ( ICDs ) are now able to monitor intrathoracic impedance . A clinical event ( CE ) was deemed to have occurred if it result ed in hospitalization or milder manifestations of HF deterioration . Three hundred sixty-two acute decreases in intrathoracic impedance ( Z events ) occurred in 230 patients . Of these episodes , 171 ( 47 % ) were associated with a CE within 2 weeks of the Z event . The rate of unexplained Z events was 0.25 per patient-year and 25 hospitalizations were not associated with Z events . The audible alert was disabled in a group of 102 patients ( OFF group ) . HF hospitalizations occurred in 29 ( 7 % ) patients in the ON group and 20 ( 20 % , P < 0.001 ) patients in the OFF group . The rate of combined cardiac death and HF hospitalization was lower in patients with Alert ON ( log-rank test , P = 0.007 ) . CONCLUSIONS The ICD reliably detected CE and yielded low rates of unexplained and undetected events . The alert capability seemed to reduce the number of HF hospitalizations by allowing timely detection and therapeutic intervention. ABSTRACT  AIMS Early recognition of impending decompensation and timely intervention may prevent heart failure ( HF ) hospitalization . METHODS AND RESULTS SENSE-HF was a prospect i ve , multi-centre study that enrolled 501 patients . Sensitivity appeared to be dynamic in nature and at the end of Phase I , had increased to 42.1 % . With 253 OptiVol detections , PPV for Phase I was 4.7 % . A total of 233 patients noted such an OptiVol alert and for 210 , HF status was evaluated within 30 days . Heart failure status had worsened for 80 patients ( PPV = 38.1 % ) . Sensitivity improved within the first 6 months after implant . Further studies are needed to assess the place of this monitoring technology in the clinical management of patients with HF. ABSTRACT  BACKGROUND Some implantable devices continuously monitor HF device diagnostic information , but data are limited on the ability of combined HF device diagnostics to predict HF events . HF events were independently adjudicated . A combined HF device diagnostic algorithm was developed on an independent data set . We used univariate and multivariable analyses to determine predictors of subsequent HF events within a month . RESULTS We analyzed data from 694 CRT defibrillator patients who were followed for 11.7 + /- 2 months . Ninety patients had 141 adjudicated HF  hospitalizations with pulmonary congestion  at least 60 days after implantation . CONCLUSIONS Monthly review of HF device diagnostic data identifies patients at a higher risk of HF hospitalizations within the subsequent month . ( PARTNERS HF : Program to Access and Review Trending Information and Evaluate Correlation to Symptoms in Patients With Heart Failure ; NCT00279955 ). ABSTRACT  Daily impedance changes were used to calculate a fluid index that could be compared with a prespecified threshold . Unexplained detections were defined as threshold crossings or acute weight gains not associated with worsening HF . Impedance measurements were performed on > 99 % of follow-up days , compared with only 76 % of days for weight measurements . Sixty-five HF events occurred during follow-up ( 0.32/patient-year ) . Forty HF events were detected by impedance but not weight , whereas 5 were detected by weight but not impedance . The sensitivity and unexplained detection rate  of intrathoracic  impedance monitoring was superior to that seen for acute weight changes . Intrathoracic impedance monitoring represents a useful adjunctive clinical tool for managing HF in patients with implanted devices\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

controversial and made necessary large studies . The European R and omized study of Screening for Prostate cancer ( ERSPC ) was initiated in 1994 . Eight countries including France are participating . Men aged 50 - 74 and living in the Tarn or H\\u00e9rault were included . In case of PSA greater than or equal to 3 ng/ml , biopsy was recommended . Included men in both screening and control group were followed through cancer registries . Participation rate was 36.9 % in Tarn and 24.3 % in H\\u00e9rault . Corresponding RR for Tarn and H\\u00e9rault were 1.37 and 1.20 respectively . CONCLUSION Participation rate at first round was modest . Profile of men who participated compared to men who did not were different . The control group was probably contaminated by PSA testing outside study protocol . Consequences at ERSPC level of this low participation rate on final analysis remain to be determined. ABSTRACT  The design is a multicenter , two-armed , r and omized trial with 37,000 females and 37,000 males in each of the two arms . In the intervention arm , the  PSA and CA125 tests  are performed at entry , then annually for 5 years . The  DRE , TVU , and chest X-ray exams  are performed at entry and then annually for 3 years . Sigmoidoscopy is performed at entry and then at the 5-year point . This paper describes eligibility , consent , and other design features of the trial , r and omization and screening procedures , and an outline of the follow-up procedures . Sample -size calculations are reported , and a data analysis plan is presented. ABSTRACT  We evaluated mortality results in the Finnish Prostate Cancer Screening Trial , the largest component of ERSPC . The primary endpoint was PC-specific mortality . Men in the CA received usual care . The analysis covers follow-up to 12 years from r and omization for all men . Hazard ratios ( HRs ) were estimated for incidence and mortality using Cox proportional hazard model . All statistical tests were two-sided . To avoid one PC death , we needed to invite 1199 men to screening and to detect 25 PCs . We observed no difference in all-cause mortality between trial arms .. ABSTRACT  BACKGROUND Prostate cancer is one of the leading causes of death from malignant disease among men in the developed world . One strategy to decrease the risk of death from this disease is screening with prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) ; however , the extent of benefit and harm with such screening is under continuous debate . The primary endpoint was prostate-cancer specific mortality , analysed according to the intention-to-screen principle . The study is ongoing , with men who have not reached the upper age limit invited for PSA testing . This is the first planned report on cumulative prostate-cancer incidence and mortality calculated up to Dec 31 , 2008 . This study is registered as an International St and ard R and omised Controlled Trial IS RCT N54449243 . FINDINGS In each group , 48 men were excluded from the analysis because of death or emigration before the r and omisation date , or prevalent prostate cancer . In men r and omised to screening , 7578 ( 76 % ) of 9952 attended at least once . The rate ratio for death from prostate cancer was 0.56 ( 95 % CI 0.39 - 0.82 ; p=0.002 ) in the screening compared with the control group . The rate ratio of death from prostate cancer for attendees compared with the control group was 0.44 ( 95 % CI 0.28 - 0.68 ; p=0.0002 ) . INTERPRETATION This study shows that prostate cancer mortality was reduced almost by half over 14 years . However , the risk of over-diagnosis is substantial and the number needed to treat is at least as high as in breast-cancer screening programmes . The benefit of prostate-cancer screening compares favourably to other cancer screening programs . FUNDING The Swedish Cancer Society , the Swedish Research Council , and the National Cancer Institute. ABSTRACT  Objective To assess whether screening for prostate cancer reduces prostate cancer specific mortality . Design Population based r and omised controlled trial . Setting Department of Urology , Norrk\\u00f6ping , and the South-East Region Prostate Cancer Register . These men were invited to be screened every third year from 1987 to 1996 . On the first two occasions screening was done by digital rectal examination only . From 1993 , this was combined with prostate specific antigen testing , with 4 \\u00b5g/L as cut off . On the fourth occasion ( 1996 ) , only men aged 69 or under at the time of the investigation were invited . Prostate cancer specific mortality up to 31 December 2008 . There were 85 cases ( 5.7 % ) of prostate cancer diagnosed in the screened group and 292 ( 3.9 % ) in the control group . After adjustment for age at start of the study , the hazard ratio was 1.58 ( 1.06 to 2.36 ; P=0.024 ) . Trial registration Current Controlled Trials , IS RCT N06342431. ABSTRACT  This is the first report from the Prostate , Lung , Colorectal , and Ovarian ( PLCO ) Cancer Screening Trial on prostate-cancer mortality . Men in the screening group were offered annual PSA testing for 6 years and digital rectal examination for 4 years . The subjects and health care providers received the results and decided on the type of follow-up evaluation . Usual care sometimes included screening , as some organizations have recommended . The numbers of all cancers and deaths and causes of death were ascertained . RESULTS In the screening group , rates of compliance were 85 % for PSA testing and 86 % for digital rectal examination . The data at 10 years were 67 % complete and consistent with these overall findings . ( Clinical Trials.gov number , NCT00002540 .. ABSTRACT  Mortality after 7 - 10 years of follow-up has been reported previously . We report extended follow-up to 13 years after the trial . Screening was completed in October 2006 . All incident prostate cancers and deaths from prostate cancer through 13 years of follow-up or through December 31 , 2009 , were ascertained . All statistical tests were two-sided . RESULTS Approximately 92 % of the study participants were followed to 10 years and 57 % to 13 years . At 13 years , 4250 participants had been diagnosed with prostate cancer in the intervention arm compared with 3815 in the control arm .. ABSTRACT  PURPOSE This clinical trial is aim ed at evaluating the impact of prostate cancer screening on cancer-specific mortality . At follow-up visits , serum PSA only was used . Median follow-up of screened men was 7.93 years . These results are in agreement with the continuous decrease of prostate cancer mortality observed in North America. ABSTRACT  BACKGROUND The incidence of prostate cancer has increased substantially since it became common practice to screen asymptomatic men for the disease . Variations in the screening algorithm , such as the interval between screening rounds , likely influence the morbidity , mortality , and quality of life of the screened population . All participants who were diagnosed with prostate cancer through December 31 , 2005 , but at most 10 years after the initial screening were ascertained by linkage with the national cancer registries . We used Mantel Cox regression to assess differences between rates of interval cancers and aggressive interval cancers at the two centers . All statistical tests were two-sided . CONCLUSION The rate of interval cancer , especially aggressive interval cancer , was low in this study . The 2-year screening interval had higher detection rates than the 4-year interval but did not lead to lower rates of interval and aggressive interval prostate cancers. ABSTRACT  All men r and omized were included , only those with prostate cancer screen\\u2010detected or clinical ly diagnosed before July 1997 were omitted from the analyses . These rates were higher than those recorded at the national and regional levels , 33 and 38 per 1,000 person\\u2010years , respectively . An opposite pattern was observed in the screening arm , where participants already had received the scheduled screening within the trial . Over a 4\\u2010year rescreening interval , the average PSA and effective contamination amount were approximately 28 % and 10 % , respectively . PSA testing in the control arm in the Rotterdam ERSPC section is high , but was not followed by a substantial increase in prostate biopsies . \\u00a9 2003 Wiley\\u2010Liss ,. ABSTRACT  Date s and causes of death were collected on an annual basis . A Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to calculate overall and cancer-specific survival . RESULTS A total of 2,416 men were recruited in the screening arm and 1,862 in the control arm . Mean age was 57.8 years , median follow-up was 13.3 years . At the end of the follow-up period , 427 deaths ( 9 from PCa ) were observed . Most relevant causes of death were malignant tumors ( 52.9 % ) , cardiovascular disease ( 17.3 % ) and respiratory ( 8.9 % ) . Only 2.1 % of deaths ( 0.2 % of all recruited men ) were due to PCa ( 2.5 % screening , 1.6 % control ) . CONCLUSIONS The Spanish arm of ERSPC failed to reproduce the long-term results shown in the whole study . No differences in mortality ( overall or cancer-specific ) were observed after 15 years of follow-up . PCa mortality was infrequent ( less than 1 % ) . These results suggest limited yield of PCa screening in our setting. ABSTRACT  Screening for prostate cancer ( PC ) remains a controversial issue despite some new evidence on the mortality benefits of PC screening . We conducted a prospect i ve , r and omized screening trial in Finl and to investigate whether screening decreases PC incidence . Here , we report the incidence results from three screening rounds during a 12-year period . The mean follow-up time for PC incidence in both arms was over 9 years . The incidence of localized PC was 7.5 in the SA and 4.6 in the CA , IRR = 1.6 ( 1.5 - 1.7 ) . The results from our large population -based trial indicate that screening for PC decreases the incidence of advanced PC . When compared with the CA , the PC detected in the SA there were substantially more often localized , low- grade PCs due to overdiagnosis. ABSTRACT  To report the results from  Switzerl and 's participation in the ERSPC from 1998 ; importantly , epidemiological data showed that Switzerl and has one of the highest rates of morbidity and mortality from prostate cancer in the world . The local study protocol was accepted by the ethical committee and after the successful pilot study phase , the centre joined the ERSPC. ABSTRACT  Men were screened with PSA test at a 2 - 7 year interval depending on the centre ; PSA cut-off was 3.0 - 4.0 ng/ml . A positive screen with no histologically confirmed PC in biopsy within 1 year was defined as an FP result . RESULTS Of the 61,604 men who were screened at least once , 17.8 % had one or more FP result ( s ) . Almost 20 % of men who participated at all screening rounds had one or more FP result ( s ) . More than half of the men with an FP result had another FP if screened again . The PCs following an FP result were in 92.8 % of cases localised and low- grade versus 90.4 % following a screen-negative result . False-positive men are more prone to be diagnosed with PC but are also likely to have consistently high PSA levels. ABSTRACT  However , results analyzed by comorbidity strata remain unknown . RESULTS After 10 years of follow-up , 9,565 deaths occurred , 164 from PC . CONCLUSION Selective use of PSA screening for men in good health appears to reduce the risk of PCSM with minimal overtreatment. ABSTRACT  The specific details of the French national programme are based on the design of a local mass screening programme . The protocol includes r and omization before information and consent . In addition , knowledge of any pre\\u2010existing PSA test is obtained through the health insurance data base .. ABSTRACT  Centres recruit different age groups and have different design s for recruiting and countries have different underlying risks for prostate cancer . Recruitment has reached 163,126 men aged 55 - 69 at entry now . Our purpose was to calculate the power of the trial and at what point in time can statistically significant differences in prostate cancer mortality be expected . Recruitment data were collected from the screening centres . We calculated the expected number of prostate cancer deaths in each follow-up year , based on national statistics and expected rate in trial entrants . The power was calculated using different assumptions on intervention effect and contamination rate and also if the ERSPC trial would cooperate with other trials . With an assumed 25 % intervention effect in men actually screened and a 20 % contamination rate , the trial will reach a power of 0.86 in 2008 . With an assumed intervention effect of 40 % , the power reaches 0.90 in 2003 - 2004 . Adding more centres with compliance rates lower than 45 % decreases the power of the trial .. ABSTRACT  The principal screening method at all centers is determination of  serum prostate\\u2010specific antigen ( PSA ) . An additional 6 % was referred for further assessment based on other criteria , with much less efficiency . Differences in PSA by country are largely attributable to the age structure of the study population . Considerable progress has been made in both trials . Enrollment will be completed in 2001 . A substantial number of early prostate cancers have been detected . The differences between countries seem to reflect both underlying prostate cancer incidence and screening policy . The trials have the power to show definitive results in 2005\\u20132008 . \\u00a9 2002 Wiley\\u2010Liss ,. ABSTRACT  Prostate cancer has become the most frequent cancer and the second cause of cancer mortality in men . This public health problem is becoming increasingly important due to the increasing life expectancy . At the present time , prostate cancer will be discovered in one in every eight men during their lifetime . Prostate cancer represents 25 % of all new cases of male cancers . Prostate cancer screening is design ed to detect early stage , asymptomatic prostate cancer , as the patient 's chances of cure are higher when the cancer is diagnosed at an early stage . The conclusions of the ANAES evaluation in 1998 did not recommend mass screening for prostate cancer . If total PSA is above the normal value of the test or if digital rectal examination is abnormal , referral to a urologist is recommended . Information concerning the limits , benefits and risks of screening and the available treatment options must be given before performing these examinations. ABSTRACT  The remaining 7532 men were treated as controls . In 1987 and 1990 only  digital rectal examination ( DRE )  was performed , in 1993 and 1996 DRE was combined with a test for Prostate-Specific Antigen ( PSA ) . TNM categories , grade of malignancy , management and cause of death were recorded in the South-East Region Prostate Cancer Register . In the SG 48 ( 56.5 % ) of the tumours and in the UG 78 ( 26.7 % ) were localised at diagnosis ( p < 0.001 ) . In the SG 21 ( 25 % ) and in the UG 41 ( 14 % ) received curative treatment . There was no significant difference in total or prostate cancer-specific survival between the groups .. ABSTRACT  OBJECTIVE To describe the natural history of initially untreated early-stage prostate cancer . A key secondary objective was to calculate long-term survival rates by stage , grade , and age at diagnosis . DESIGN Prospect i ve cohort study . SETTING Population -based in 1 county of Sweden , without screening for prostate cancer . RESULTS In the entire cohort , prostate cancer accounted for 201 ( 37 % ) of all 541 deaths . Among 300 patients with a diagnosis of localized disease ( T0-T2 ) , 33 ( 11 % ) died of prostate cancer . Without reliable prognostic indicators , an aggressive approach to all patients with early disease would entail substantial overtreatment . In contrast , patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease need trials of aggressive therapy to improve their poor prognosis. ABSTRACT  PURPOSE We evaluated long-term survival in attendees and nonattendees of a 1-time screening for prostate cancer . Of the invited men 1,782 ( 74 % ) attended . Screening attendees were examined with digital rectal examination , transrectal ultrasound and prostate specific antigen analysis . When cancer was suspected , prostate biopsies were taken . A total of 65 men with prostate cancer were detected by this procedure . RESULTS Incidence rate ratios were calculated using Poisson regression models . In contrast , the corresponding incidence rate ratio in nonattendees was 1.53 ( 95 % CI 1.37 - 1.71 ) . These findings should be considered when interpreting previous and upcoming studies of the effect of screening programs. ABSTRACT  To be effective , such a program should be able to reduce the absolute number of men diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer ( for which no cure is available ) . The aim of the present report is to evaluate whether PSA-based screening reduces the risk of being diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer . METHODS A population -based , prospect i ve , r and omized , controlled screening trial for prostate cancer started in 1995 ( the G\\u00f6teborg branch of the European R and omized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer [ ERSPC ] ) . However , the risk of being diagnosed with prostate cancer increased 1.8-fold with PSA-based screening . CONCLUSIONS Biennial PSA screening reduces the risk of being diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer , the first prerequisite for achieving decreased cancer mortality  in younger men . This putative benefit is balanced by a 1.8-fold increased risk for diagnosis of prostate cancer. ABSTRACT  To report the initial results from Sweden of a large population \\u2010based r and omized study of screening using prostate\\u2010specific antigen ( PSA ) to detect prostate cancer , as the efficacy of such screening to decrease prostate cancer mortality has not yet been proven. ABSTRACT  BACKGROUND Evidence from r and omized trials on the effects of screening for prostate cancer ( PCa ) on disease-specific mortality accumulates slowly with increasing follow-up . OBJECTIVE To assess data on PCa-specific mortality in the Rotterdam section of the European R and omized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer ( ERSPC ) trial . DESIGN , SETTING , AND PARTICIPANTS A r and omized controlled trial with r and omization after signed , written informed consent ( efficacy trial ) . OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Number of PCas detected per arm depicted by predefined time periods and prognostic groups . PCa-specific mortality analyses using Poisson regression in age group 55 - 74 yr at r and omization and separately in the predefined age group of 55 - 69 yr . Thirty-two percent of all men r and omized have died . A 14.1 % increase was found in men aged 70 - 74 yr ( not statistically significant ) . Absolute PCa mortality was 1.8 per 1000 men r and omized ( 2.6 per 1000 men r and omized in age group 55 - 69 yr ) . The number needed to invite and number needed to manage were 565 and 33 , respectively , for age group 55 - 74 yr , and 392 and 24 , respectively , for age group 65 - 69 yr . Given the slow natural history of the disease , follow-up might be too short . CONCLUSIONS Systematic PSA-based screening reduced PCa-specific mortality by 32 % in the age range of 55 - 69 yr . The roughly twofold higher incidence in the S-arm underlines the importance of tools to better identify those men who would benefit from screening\",\n          \" BACKGROUND There is increased pressure on primary care physicians to monitor oral anticoagulation . METHODS A r and omized , controlled trial in 12 primary care practice s in Birmingham , Engl and ( 9 intervention and 3 control ) . Intervention practice s ' patients were r and omized to the intervention ( practice -based anticoagulation clinic ) or control ( hospital clinic ) group . The main outcome measure was therapeutic control of the international normalized ratio . St and ard measures of control of the international normalized ratio ( point prevalence ) showed no significant difference between the intervention and control groups . Care given by this model is at least as good as routine hospital follow-up . The model is generalizable to primary health care centers operating in developed health care systems. ABSTRACT  OBJECTIVE To investigate the effect of meal-related self-monitoring of blood glucose on glycemic control and well-being in non-insulin-treated type 2 diabetic patients . RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS This 6-month study , which included 6 months of follow-up , adopted a prospect i ve , multicenter , r and omized controlled design . The primary efficacy parameter was the change in HbA(1c ) . Secondary efficacy variables included changes in body weight , lipids , and microalbumin and changes in treatment satisfaction and well-being . Body weight , total cholesterol , and microalbumin improved when using a glucometer , but there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups . Treatment satisfaction increased in both groups to a similar extent ( P = 0.9 ) . Self-monitoring result ed in a marked improvement of general well-being with significant improvements in the subitems depression ( P = 0.032 ) and lack of well-being ( P = 0.02 ) . The finding of three types of responders will be important for future planning of counseling and educational interventions. ABSTRACT  Participants might ignore follow-up , leave town , or take aspartame when instructed to take aspirin . Exclusions before r and omisation do not bias the treatment comparison , but they can hurt generalisability . Eligibility criteria for a trial should be clear , specific , and applied before r and omisation . In principle , assessment of exclusions after r and omisation is simple : none are allowed . In reality , however , losses frequently occur . Investigators can also do secondary analyses on , for instance , per- protocol or as-treated participants . Such analyses should be described as secondary and non-r and omised comparisons . Mish and ling of exclusions causes serious method ological difficulties . Creative mismanagement of exclusions can undermine trial validity. ABSTRACT  CONTEXT Control of oral anticoagulation therapy has been reported to often be inadequate . Previous retrospective investigations suggest that patients ' self-adjustment of oral anticoagulants may lead to improved control . OBJECTIVE To investigate the effects of patients ' self-management of oral anticoagulation therapy on accuracy of control and measures of treatment-related quality of life . DESIGN R and omized , single-blind , multicenter trial . SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS A total of 179 patients receiving long-term oral anticoagulation treatment were enrolled at 5 referral centers in Germany . The control group received conventional care as provided by family physicians , including referral to specialists if necessary . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Deviation of INR values from the individual INR target range ( squared ) and the 5 categories of treatment-related quality of life . Also , the intervention group had INR values within the target range more often ( repeated measurement analysis for categorical data , P=.006 ) . Treatment-related quality -of-life measures , especially treatment satisfaction scores , were significantly higher in the intervention group compared with controls . Further studies are needed to describe whether the program will reduce risk of bleeding or thromboembolism. ABSTRACT  Fifty-four patients with type II diabetes mellitus , not treated with insulin , who had inadequate glucose control on diet aloneor diet and oral hypoglycemic agents were studied . Patients performed SMBG or urine glucose testing as part of a st and ardized treatment program that also included diet and exercise counseling . Seventeen ( 31 % ) of54 patients actually normalized their glycosylated hemoglobin values , 9 in the urine-testing group and 8 in the SMBG group . Comparisons between the urine-testing and SMBG groups showed no significant differences in mean fasting plasma glucose ( P > 0.86 ) , glycosylated hemoglobin ( P > 0.95 ) , or weight ( P < 0.19 ) . In patients with type II diabetes mellitus not treated with insulin , SMBG is no more effective , but is 8\\u201312 times more expensive , thanurine testing in facilitating improved glycemic control . Our results do not support widespread use of SMBG in diabetic patients not treated with insulin. ABSTRACT  Small portable devices have enabled patient self-monitoring of anticoagulation and self-adjustment of the dose . Patients were self-managed or were managed by the anticoagulation clinic for a period of 3 months . After this period the alternative strategy was followed for each patient . The primary endpoint was the number of measurements within the therapeutic range ( therapeutic target value + /-50.5 INR units ) . FINDINGS There was no significant difference in the overall quality of control of anticoagulation between the two study periods . The proportion of patients who spent most time in the therapeutic target range was larger during self-management than during anticoagulation clinic-guided management . A patient-satisfaction assessment showed superiority of self-management over conventional care . It is also better appreciated by patients . Larger studies are required to assess the effect of this novel management strategy on the incidence of thromboembolic or bleeding complications. ABSTRACT  OBJECTIVE To compare the effect of SM with physician-management ( PM ) on the maintenance of therapeutic anticoagulation . METHODS A r and omized , open-label eight-month trial was performed . Exclusion criteria were a known hypercoaguable disorder , mental incompetence , a language barrier or an inability to attend training sessions . Patients r and omly assigned to PM received usual care from their general practitioner . The primary outcome was to demonstrate 20 % improvement in anticoagulation control by SM . RESULTS One hundred forty patients were r and omly assigned ( 70 per group ) . Thirteen patients dropped out of SM early due to an inability to self-manage . Patients managing their own therapy spent less time below the therapeutic range ( 15.0 % versus 27.3 % , P=0.04 ) . There were three major complications of thrombosis or bleeding , all occurring in the PM arm . All patients who completed SM preferred to continue with that strategy . CONCLUSIONS SM was not significantly better than PM in maintaining therapeutic anticoagulation . SM was feasible and appeared safe in the present study population. ABSTRACT  A diabetes protocol characterized by self-monitoring of blood glucose was introduced in four general practice s with the aim of making the frequency of consultations dependent on the metabolic regulation and emphasizing body weight reduction . The feasibility of the programme was investigated and the results after 1 year were compared with those of conventional care in four control practice s. In the experimental practice s , 13 patients switched from a medical specialist 's to a general practitioner 's supervision  , 20 remained under supervision of their GP  and 33 started self-monitoring . The self-monitoring rate , the consultation frequency according to protocol , the low number of dropouts and inadequate referrals and adherence to the therapeutic scheme showed that the protocol was feasible for both the GPs and the patients . At the initial assessment , the regulation of the diabetes was worse in patients of the experimental group , compared with those of the control group ( mean HbA1 9.7 % vs 8.9 % ; p less than 0.05 ) . On average , patients in the experimental group ( n = 56 ) lost 0.4 kg of body weight , whereas those in the control group ( n = 73 ) gained 0.1 kg ( n.s . ) The mean change in HbA1 , adjusted for the initial value , was -0.4 % in the experimental and + 0.5 % in the control group ( p less than 0.05 ) . The results of the protocol can be attributed to a combination of greater participation of the patient , the individualized consultation frequency and the prescription of oral hypoglycaemic agents according to body weight development. ABSTRACT  Self-monitoring of blood glucose levels is currently being recommended for obese patients with type II diabetes to improve weight loss and glycemic control . Both groups lost significant amounts of weight and maintained their losses for at least one year ; reductions in medication could be made for 70 percent of patients . These data suggest that the behavioral weight control used in this study may be of benefit to patients with type II diabetes . However , there was no evidence that the addition of self-monitoring of blood glucose levels to the treatment program improved the outcome in terms of weight loss , reduction in medication , dietary compliance , or mood state. ABSTRACT  Two thous and patients suitable for self-management will be assigned at r and om to either the self-management group or the control group . The numbers of thromboembolic and hemorrhagic complications requiring treatment during the 2-year follow-up period will be recorded as the primary end point . The secondary endpoint variables will be maintenance of the INR value in the individual target range , INR variance , the course of complications over time , and the cost efficiency of self-management compared with the routine procedures . The last of these parameters will include the diagnostic and /or therapeutic measures carried out , the duration of inpatient hospital treatment , and the social consequences ( subsequent rehabilitation treatment , inability to work , forced retirement ) . Since this rate can be halved by self-management , a one-tailed chi 2-test of 80 % power and a 5 % significance threshold would require n = 997 patients per group . The results of the SMAAF study will establish the socioeconomic benefits of self-management in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. ABSTRACT  RESULTS Almost 80 % of the INR values recorded by patients at home were within the stipulated therapeutic range , INR 2.5 to 4.5 , compared with just 62 % of INR values recorded by family practitioners . The overall complication rate ( hemorrhages and thromboembolic events ) of the self-management group was significantly ( p < 0.05 ) decreased compared with the conventional group . CONCLUSIONS Through INR self-management , an improvement in the quality of ongoing oral anticoagulation could be shown . Starting this form of therapeutic control early after mechanical heart valve replacement appears to effect a further reduction in anticoagulant-induced complications. ABSTRACT  BACKGROUND Several studies have demonstrated that patient self-management of oral anticoagulant therapy ( OAT )  can improve treatment quality . However , most of these studies were not conducted within a specialized anticoagulation care system . The objective of the present study was to determine whether patient self-management of OAT improves the quality of care delivered by anticoagulation clinics . RESULTS Only 25.6 % of invited patients agreed to participate in the training program . Patients who remained in the existing care group were within the international normalized ratio target range 63.5 % of the time . The type of coumarin taken was a major predicting factor of OAT quality . In all study groups phenprocoumon outperformed acenocoumarol by 11.6 % ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 6.6%-16.5 % ) . Weekly management with acenocoumarol did not improve the quality of OAT . CONCLUSION With selected patients , the quality of OAT obtained through patient self-management is at least as high as that delivered by specialized physicians at anticoagulation clinics . Weekly management of OAT with long-acting phenprocoumon has to be preferred at anticoagulation clinics or , where possible , through patient self-management. ABSTRACT  At the end of the study period , the decrease of HbA1c over six months -- main endpoint -- was not significantly different between the three groups ( mean + /- SEM ; group A : -0.5 + /- 0.2 % ; group B : -0.1 + /- 0.3 % ; group C : -0.4 + /- 0.3 % ) . However , the degree of compliance to  blood glucose self-monitoring  in group C appeared to relate to the outcome : a significant correlation was found between the number of blood glucose strips used and the decrease of HbA1c ( r = .36 , p less than .02 ) . We conclude that regular self-monitoring has no definite advantage over the usual management for improving metabolic control in non-insulin-treated diabetic patients , though it may possibly help patients ready to comply with its use. ABSTRACT  Baseline hemoglobin HbA 1c ranged between 9.5 % and 13.5 % ( normal range 5.5%\\u20137.7 % ) . Subjects were matched for weight , sex , and HbAlc and assigned to small ( 4\\u20138 participants ) groups which met weekly for 12 weeks and then monthly for 16 weeks . After 8 weeks , the group were r and omized either to continue the behavioral program or to have SMBG and dietary CHO counting . Weight loss was identical in both groups during the year of follow-up . The HbA1c level showed a progressive decline in experimental subjects ( P<0.05 ) , whereas there was no improvement in control subjects. ABSTRACT  Design Multicentre open r and omised controlled trial . Setting Midl and s region of the UK . Main outcome measure Percentage of time spent within the therapeutic range of international normalised ratio . Self managed patients with poor control before the study showed an improvement in control that was not seen in the routine care group . It may improve the time spent the therapeutic range for patients with initially poor control . Trial registration IS RCT N 19313375. ABSTRACT  This study tested the hypothesis that follow-up intervention ( by telephone calls and home visit ) affects compliance in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus ( NIDDM ) . No significant differences were seen in post study HbA 1c values and weight changes between the two groups . Follow-up inter vention by telephone calls and home visit can enhance patient compliance to certain aspects of the prescribed diabetes management plan. ABSTRACT  STUDY OBJECTIVE To evaluate the efficacy and accuracy of monitoring prothrombin times at home . DESIGN R and omized , prospect i ve cohort study . SETTING Out patients discharged from a university hospital or a community hospital . There were no major thromboembolic or hemorrhagic complications in either group . CONCLUSIONS Use of a portable prothrombin time monitor by patients at home is feasible and provides accurate measurements . Patients doing home monitoring achieve superior anticoagulation control compared with those receiving st and ard anticoagulation clinic care. ABSTRACT  Context Although many out patients require oral anticoagulation , the optimal management of outpatient anticoagulation remains uncertain . The Editors Indications for oral anticoagulant treatment to prevent thromboembolic disease have increased in recent years ( 1 ) . The establishment of accurate therapeutic INR ranges was also beneficial . Target ranges include the safest INR values that carry the lowest risk for hemorrhagic or thromboembolic complications ( 2 ) . Currently , portable coagulometers are available for determining INR easily and reliably ( 8) . This technology provides interesting clinical models for the control of oral anticoagulant treatment , the most promising of which are patient self-testing and patient self-management . For patient self-testing , patients measure INRs themselves and ask their referring physicians for the proper anticoagulant dose . Patient self-management assumes that patients will adjust their own doses and is the most autonomous strategy . The clinical staff includes trained nurses . Computers control the clinical data and INR records , ensuring excellent follow-up . Samsa and Matchar ( 20 ) recommended that these characteristics be used to provide an appropriate control group in a trial on patient self-management . The institutional review board of our hospital approved the study . Once the patient ( or his or her caregiver ) agreed to participate , written informed consent was obtained . Next , central ized telephone r and omization assigned the patient to the experimental group ( patient self-management ) or to the control group ( conventional management ) . The allocation sequence was generated at the hospital 's epidemiology department , and the sequence of r and omization was concealed until the patient was assigned to a group . Members of our anticoagulation clinic enrolled participants and assigned them to groups . Follow-up for patients assigned to the conventional management group was done immediately . The program consisted of 2 sessions of 2 hours each on consecutive days . A specially trained nurse was responsible for teaching the patients in small , organized groups . The lessons included basic theoretical and practical concepts involving the use of a coagulometer , interpretation of INR , and adjustment of dose . The concepts of target range and dose modification were emphasized when necessary . A simple card system was design ed to help the patient select the correct dose . For each target range , a specific card was provided . Patients were taught to use the portable coagulometer CoaguChek S ( Roche Diagnostics , Mannheim , Germany ) with the appropriate reagent strips . When the INR result was out of target range , our dosing protocol indicated that we should advance the next appointment for INR testing to 1 or 2 weeks . International normalized ratio was determined by means of a st and ard KC 10 coagulometer ( Amelung , Lemgo , Germany ) . As a thromboplastin , we used Thromborel S ( Behring , Marburg , Germany ) . A hematologist experienced in oral anticoagulation management adjusted the dose and made the appointment for the next INR test . Patients in the self-management group performed the INR tests at home once per week using the CoaguChek S kit . They determined the appropriate dose of oral anticoagulant and the time of the next INR test . All of the INR results in both groups were entered into a computer ( in the central system of our anticoagulation clinic or in the portable coagulometers ) to facilitate data management . Patients in both groups were interviewed monthly by telephone to record any complications or changes in their health status . For the conventional management group , these interviews were done approximately midway between hospital visits . The questions addressed minor or major bleeding , thromboembolic events , episodic diseases , changes in long-term medications , and hospital stays . Associated complications were diagnosed and evaluated by a third physician who was not involved in the trial and was unaware of patients ' study group . St and ard criteria were used to diagnose any thromboembolic complications . Transient ischemic attack was diagnosed clinical ly by a neurologist , and superficial thrombophlebitis was diagnosed clinical ly by an angiologist . All thromboembolic complications were considered major events . Life-threatening bleeding or bleeding requiring transfusion or hospital admission was considered a major event . Any other bleeding was considered a minor event . Statistical Analysis Study outcomes were evaluated on an intention-to-treat basis and also on an on-treatment basis .. ABSTRACT  Of these , 44 were r and omized to self\\u2010monitor their INR and 41 returned to clinic . Inter\\u2010group differences were not statistically significant ( intervention groups 0\\u00b726 \\u00b1 0\\u00b730 vs. control 0\\u00b716 \\u00b1 0\\u00b73 , P = 0\\u00b710 ) . Quality \\u2010of\\u2010life measurements and health beliefs about warfarin were unchanged ( apart from emotional role limitation ) with education or education and self\\u2010monitoring . Patient  education regarding anticoagulation therapy could be a cost\\u2010effective initiative and is worthy of further study. ABSTRACT  BACKGROUND This study was conducted to assess the ability of patients receiving heart valve replacements to practice self-managed anticoagulation using a portable coagulometer . METHODS We carried out a prospect i ve , r and omized trial , comparing self-managed anticoagulation with conventional management . There was no significant difference in mortality or morbidity between the two groups . CONCLUSIONS Self-managed anticoagulation is a reliable , easily learned method of controlling anticoagulation , and it is suitable for approximately two thirds of patients , with excellent results. ABSTRACT  Bleeding is the major side effect of warfarin and is a major deterrent to its use , especially in older patients . However , there is little controlled or experimental evidence on how to optimize management of anticoagulant therapy in older patients and prevent bleeding . Eligible patients who were enrolled did not differ significantly from those who were not enrolled with regard to age , ethnicity , sex , or indication for therapy . Figure 1 . Eligibility and r and om assignment of patients . Patients were stratified according to their baseline risk for major bleeding by using the Outpatient Bleeding Risk Index ( 20 ) . After stratification , patients were r and omly assigned to receive usual care or intervention . Informed consent for observation and data collection was then sought from both groups , and informed consent to participate in the intervention was sought from the intervention group . The sample size was calculated to provide 80 % power and an level of 0.05 . The study protocol and informed consent procedures were approved by the hospital 's institutional review board . Intervention The intervention had two main components . The first component consisted of a guideline -based consultation that assessed the patient 's indications for therapy and potential risk factors for warfarin-related bleeding . We used this method previously to reduce the frequency of anticoagulant-related bleeding  during hospitalization ( 27 ) . Specific recommendations about modifiable risk factors , such as use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs , were made and implemented . The study investigators directed warfarin dosing and international normalized ratio ( INR ) testing after hospital discharge . The lay educator review ed the workbook and was taught how to use the prothrombin time monitor by one of the authors but had no formal medical training . Coaching was aim ed to increase patients ' participation in their care and to improve information-seeking skills . The monitor uses a fingerstick to obtain a blood sample and has well-established accuracy ( 36 - 38 ) . Patients were initially assessed , educated , and taught to use the portable monitor while hospitalized ; training lasted 30 minutes to 1 hour . They were seen daily while hospitalized , warfarin therapy was adjusted as needed , and any concerns or questions about anticoagulant therapy were addressed . After the 6-month intervention period , management and dosing of warfarin therapy reverted back to patients ' personal physicians . Surveillance for bleeding and thromboembolism was conducted identically in the intervention and control groups and consisted of 12 items inquiring about bleeding and thromboembolism at each follow-up interview . All date s of death were confirmed by death certificates , and all causes of death were confirmed by review of death certificates and medical records . Follow-up was complete for all patients . End Points The primary end point was the first major bleeding event during the 6-month intervention period . Bleeding was classified without information about possible risk factors or r and omization status . Two author- review ers who were blinded to group assignment adjudicated bleeding events ; their agreement was high ( statistic , 0.97 ) . The therapeutic range of the INR was defined as 2.5 to 3.5 for persons with mechanical heart valves and 2.0 to 3.0 for persons with all other indications ( 40 ) . This approach estimates the amount of time a patient is in the therapeutic range based on the actual INRs measured , assuming a linear relationship between consecutive INRs . Patients with only one. ABSTRACT  An ageing population and the continuing expansion of clinical indications for coumadin therapy have increased pressure on hospital anticoagulant clinics . One solution is patient self\\u2010testing ( PST ) of the international normalized ratio ( INR ) using capillary blood sample s on point\\u2010of\\u2010care coagulation monitors at home . We conducted a prospect i ve study to determine whether patients can achieve accurate INR values through PST , using the CoaguChek S ( Roche Diagnostics , Lewes , UK ) . The main outcome measurements were : comparability of INR values obtained by PST and the hospital laboratory , patient acceptability as assessed by a question naire and anticoagulant control . Patients were r and omized to weekly self\\u2010testing or continuing 4\\u2010weekly hospital laboratory monitoring of INR . Comparison of INRs ( n = 234 ) showed no significant differences between the CoaguChek ( median INR 3\\u00b702 ) and laboratory testing ( median INR 3\\u00b707 ) . There was excellent correlation between the two methods ( r = 0\\u00b795 ) , with 85 % of CoaguChek results within 0\\u00b75 INR units of the laboratory method . On four occasions , differences of > 1 unit INR were obtained , but in each case the patient 's anticoagulation was unstable ( INR > 4\\u00b75 by both methods ) and the differences in INR would not have altered patient management . 87 % of patients found self\\u2010testing straightforward , 87 % were confident in the result they obtained and 77 % preferred self\\u2010testing . We conclude that PST is a reliable alternative to hospital clinic attendance and is acceptable to the majority of suitably trained patients\",\n          \" BACKGROUND Actinic keratosis is a common precursor to sun-related squamous-cell carcinoma . Treating actinic keratoses and the surrounding skin area ( i.e. , field therapy ) can eradicate clinical and sub clinical actinic keratoses . Topical field therapy currently requires weeks or months of treatment . Complete clearance ( primary outcome ) was assessed at 57 days , and local reactions were quantitatively measured . Adverse events were generally mild to moderate in intensity and resolved without sequelae . CONCLUSIONS Ingenol mebutate gel applied topically for 2 to 3 days is effective for field treatment of actinic keratoses .

ABSTRACT  BACKGROUND In r and omized trials , fecal occult-blood testing reduces mortality from colorectal cancer . However , the duration of the benefit is unknown , as are the effects specific to age and sex . Screening was performed from 1976 through 1982 and from 1986 through 1992 . We used the National Death Index to obtain up date d information on the vital status of participants and to determine causes of death through 2008 . RESULTS Through 30 years of follow-up , 33,020 participants ( 70.9 % ) died . The reduction in colorectal-cancer mortality was larger for men than for women in the biennial-screening group ( P=0.04 for interaction ) . CONCLUSIONS The effect of screening with fecal occult-blood testing on colorectal-cancer mortality persists after 30 years but does not influence all-cause mortality . The sustained reduction in colorectal-cancer mortality supports the effect of polypectomy . ( Funded by the Veterans Affairs Merit Review Award Program and others . ). ABSTRACT  BACKGROUND Women 's groups and health education by peer counsellors can improve the health of mothers and children . We assessed their effects on mortality and breastfeeding rates  in rural Malawi . METHODS We did a 2 \\u00d7 2 factorial , cluster-r and omised trial in 185,888 people in Mchinji district . 48 equal-sized clusters were r and omly allocated to four groups with a computer-generated number sequence . 24 facilitators guided groups through a community action cycle to tackle maternal and child health problems . Analysis was by intention to treat . The trial is registered as IS RCT N06477126 . FINDINGS We monitored outcomes of 26,262 births between 2005 and 2009 . Because of the interaction between the two interventions , a stratified analysis was done . FUNDING Saving Newborn Lives , UK Department for International Development , and Wellcome Trust. ABSTRACT  BACKGROUND Venous thromboembolism is a common , potentially avoidable cause of death and morbidity in patients in hospital , including those with stroke . We assessed the effectiveness of IPC to reduce the risk of DVT in patients who have had a stroke . Caregivers and patients were not masked to treatment assignment . Patients were followed up for 6 months to determine survival and later symptomatic venous thromboembolism . Patients were analysed according to their treatment allocation . TRIAL REGISTRATION IS RCT N93529999 . FINDINGS Between Dec 8 , 2008 , and Sept 6 , 2012 , 2876 patients were enrolled in 94 centres in the UK . The included patients were broadly representative of immobile stroke patients admitted to hospital and had a median age of 76 years ( IQR 67 - 84 ) . INTERPRETATION IPC is an effective method of reducing the risk of DVT and possibly improving survival in a wide variety of patients who are immobile after stroke .. ABSTRACT  BACKGROUND We previously reported that integrating antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) with tuberculosis treatment reduces mortality . However , the timing for the initiation of ART during tuberculosis treatment remains unresolved . Findings in the earlier-ART group ( ART initiated within 4 weeks after the start of tuberculosis treatment ,  214 patients ) and later-ART group ( ART initiated during the first 4 weeks of the continuation phase of tuberculosis treatment ,  215 patients ) are presented here . RESULTS At baseline , the median CD4 + T-cell count was 150 per cubic millimeter , and the median viral load was 161,000 copies per milliliter , with no significant differences between the two groups . The incidence rates of the immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome ( IRIS ) were 20.1 and 7.7 cases per 100 person-years , respectively ( incidence-rate ratio , 2.62 ; 95 % CI , 1.48 to 4.82 ; P<0.001 ) . Adverse events requiring a switching of antiretroviral drugs occurred in 10 patients in the earlier-ART group and 1 patient in the later-ART group ( P=0.006 ) . CONCLUSIONS Early initiation of ART in patients with CD4 + T-cell counts of less than 50 per cubic millimeter increased AIDS-free survival .

ABSTRACT  BACKGROUND Early termination of prolonged seizures with intravenous administration of benzodiazepines improves outcomes . For faster and more reliable administration , paramedics increasingly use an intramuscular route . The primary outcome was absence of seizures at the time of arrival in the emergency department without the need for rescue therapy . Secondary outcomes included endotracheal intubation , recurrent seizures , and timing of treatment relative to the cessation of convulsive seizures . This trial tested the hypothesis that intramuscular midazolam was noninferior to intravenous lorazepam by a margin of 10 percentage points . Adverse-event rates were similar in the two groups . CONCLUSIONS For subjects in status epilepticus , intramuscular midazolam is at least as safe and effective as intravenous lorazepam for prehospital seizure cessation .

ABSTRACT  Interventions to reduce preterm birth in these women have not been successful . We assessed whether a cervical pessary could effectively prevent poor perinatal outcomes . Participants and investigators were aware of group allocation . For women in the pessary group , a midwife or obstetrician inserted a cervical pessary between 16 and 20 weeks ' gestation . Women in the control group did not receive the pessary , but otherwise received similar obstetrical care to those in the pessary group . Analyses were by modified intention to treat .

ABSTRACT  We assessed outcomes from the TRILOGY ACS trial based on whether or not patients had coronary angiography before treatment was chosen . METHODS TRILOGY ACS ( Clinical Trials.gov number NCT00699998 ) was a r and omised controlled trial , done at more than 800 sites worldwide . Patients with non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome who were selected for management without [ corrected ] revascularisation were r and omly assigned to clopidogrel or prasugrel . The primary endpoint was cardiovascular death , myocardial infa rct ion , or stroke at 30 months . In the present analysis we assessed differences in the primary endpoint by angiography status and whether the effects of treatment on the primary endpoint differed between patients who had angiography before enrolment and those who had not . FINDINGS 7243 patients younger than 75 years were included in the TRILOGY ACS primary analysis . 3085 ( 43 % ) had angiography at baseline , 4158 ( 57 % ) had not . Overall , TIMI major bleeding and GUSTO severe bleeding were rare . Bleeding outcomes tended to be higher with prasugrel but did not differ significantly between treatment groups in either angiography cohort . This result needs to be corroborated , but it is consistent with previous trials of more versus less intensive antiplatelet treatment . FUNDING Daiichi Sankyo , Eli Lilly. ABSTRACT  After the failure of torcetrapib it was unknown if HDL produced by interaction with CETP had pro-atherogenic or pro-inflammatory properties . R and omisation was done with a computer-generated r and omisation code and was stratified by centre . Patients and investigators were masked to treatment . Analysis was by intention to treat . This trial is registered at Clinical Trials.gov , NCT00655473 . Dalcetrapib did not increase office blood pressure and the frequency of adverse events was similar between groups .

ABSTRACT  We conducted a phase 3 study of the efficacy and safety of the combination versus gemcitabine monotherapy in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer . Patients received the study treatment until disease progression . The primary end point was overall survival ; secondary end points were progression-free survival and overall response rate . RESULTS A total of 861 patients were r and omly assigned to nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine ( 431 patients ) or gemcitabine  ( 430 ) . The survival rate was 35 % in the nab-paclitaxel-gemcitabine group versus 22 % in the gemcitabine group at 1 year , and 9 % versus 4 % at 2 years . Febrile neutropenia occurred in 3 % versus 1 % of the patients in the two groups . In the nab-paclitaxel-gemcitabine group , neuropathy of grade 3 or higher improved to grade 1 or lower in a median of 29 days . ( Funded by Celgene ; Clinical Trials.gov number , NCT00844649 . ). ABSTRACT  OBJECTIVES Gender and ethnicity are factors affecting the incidence and severity of vascular disease as well as subsequent treatment outcomes . This study describes the reporting of gender and ethnicity data in vascular surgery RCTs and analyzes whether these studies adequately represent our diverse patient population . Included studies were examined for gender and ethnicity data , study parameters , funding source , and geographic region . The Nationwide Inpatient Sample ( NIS ) data base was analyzed to obtain group-specific procedure frequency as an estimate of procedure frequency in the general population . RESULTS We review ed 77 studies , and 52 met our inclusion criteria . Only 85 % reported gender , and 21 % reported ethnicity . Reporting of ethnicity was strongly associated with larger ( > 280 participants ) , multicenter , government-funded trials ( P < .001 for all ) . CONCLUSIONS Minority ethnicity and female gender are under-reported and under-represented in vascular surgery RCTs , particularly in small , non-government-funded and single-center trials . The generalizability of some trial results may not be applicable to these population s. Greater effort to enroll a balanced study population in RCTs may yield more broadly applicable results. ABSTRACT  BACKGROUND Arthroscopic partial meniscectomy is one of the most common orthopedic procedures , yet rigorous evidence of its efficacy is lacking . Patients were r and omly assigned to arthroscopic partial meniscectomy or sham surgery . RESULTS In the intention-to-treat analysis , there were no significant between-group differences in the change from baseline to 12 months in any primary outcome . CONCLUSIONS In this trial involving patients without knee osteoarthritis but with symptoms of a degenerative medial meniscus tear , the outcomes after arthroscopic partial meniscectomy were no better than those after a sham surgical procedure .

ABSTRACT  BACKGROUND Bevacizumab has been suggested to have similar effectiveness to ranibizumab for treatment of neovascular age-related macular degeneration . Here , we report the findings at the prespecified 2-year timepoint . Study participants and clinical assessors were masked to drug allocation . Allocation to continuous or discontinuous treatment was masked up to 3 months , at which point investigators and participants were unmasked . The primary outcome was BCVA at 2 years , with a prespecified non-inferiority limit of 3\\u00b75 letters . The primary safety outcome was arterial thrombotic event or hospital admission for heart failure . Analyses were by modified intention to treat . This trial is registered , number IS RCT N92166560 . FINDINGS Between March 27 , 2008 , and Oct 15 , 2010 , 628 patients underwent r and omisation . 18 were withdrawn ; 610 received study drugs ( 314 ranibizumab ; 296 bevacizumab ) and were included in analyses . Discontinuous treatment was neither non-inferior nor inferior to continuous treatment ( -1\\u00b763 letters , -4\\u00b701 to 0\\u00b775 ; p=0\\u00b718 ) . INTERPRETATION Ranibizumab and bevacizumab have similar efficacy . Reduction in the frequency of retreatment result ed in a small loss of efficacy irrespective of drug . Safety was worse when treatment was administered discontinuously . These findings highlight that the choice of anti-VEGF treatment strategy is less straightforward than previously thought .

The overall rate of ascertainment of RAS status was 90 % . A total of 108 patients ( 17 % ) with nonmutated KRAS exon 2 had other RAS mutations . BRAF mutations were a negative prognostic factor . No new safety signals were identified . CONCLUSIONS Additional RAS mutations predicted a lack of response in patients who received panitumumab-FOLFOX4 . In patients who had metastatic colorectal cancer without RAS mutations , improvements in overall survival were observed with panitumumab-FOLFOX4 therapy .

The primary endpoint was first cardiovascular event , including cardiovascular mortality and morbidity , revascularisation , and non-traumatic amputation within 5 years . Patients and staff assessing outcomes were unaware of the practice 's study group assignment . Analysis was done by intention to treat . This study is registered with Clinical Trials.gov , number NCT00237549 . Findings Primary endpoint data were available for 3055 ( 99\\u00b79 % ) of 3057 screen-detected patients . The mean age was 60\\u00b73 ( SD 6\\u00b79 ) years and the mean duration of follow-up was 5\\u00b73 ( SD 1\\u00b76 ) years . Improvements in cardiovascular risk factors ( HbA1c and cholesterol concentrations and blood pressure ) were slightly but significantly better in the intensive treatment group .. ABSTRACT  The primary end point was length of stay in the hospital . Secondary end points included rates of discharge from the emergency department , major adverse cardiovascular events at 28 days , and cumulative costs . Safety end points were undetected acute coronary syndromes . RESULTS The rate of acute coronary syndromes  among 1000 patients with a mean ( \\u00b1SD ) age of 54\\u00b18 years ( 47 % women ) was 8 % . There were no undetected acute coronary syndromes and no significant differences in major adverse cardiovascular events at 28 days . After CCTA , there was more downstream testing and higher radiation exposure . The cumulative mean cost of care was similar in the CCTA group and the st and ard-evaluation group ( $ 4,289 and $ 4,060 , respectively ; P=0.65 ) .

ABSTRACT  BACKGROUND Catheter-associated urinary tract infection ( CAUTI ) is a major preventable cause of harm for patients in hospital . Patients undergoing unplanned catheterisation were also included and consent for participation was obtained retrospectively . Participants and trial staff were unmasked to treatment assignment . Data were collected by trial staff and by patient-reported question naires for 6 weeks after r and omisation . The primary outcome was incidence of symptomatic urinary tract infection for which an antibiotic was prescribed by 6 weeks . This study is registered , number IS RCT N75198618 . Rates of catheter-related discomfort were higher in the nitrofural group than they were in the other groups . INTERPRETATION Silver alloy-coated catheters were not effective for reduction of incidence of symptomatic CAUTI . The reduction we noted in CAUTI associated with nitrofural-impregnated catheters was less than that regarded as clinical ly important . Routine use of antimicrobial-impregnated catheters is not supported by this trial . FUNDING UK National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment Programme. ABSTRACT  BACKGROUND The higher prevalence and cost of depression for women compared with men and the possible gender differences in treatment response dem and the inclusion of women in clinical trials of depression treatments . The purpose of this study is to examine the inclusion of women and gender-specific analyses in recent r and omized clinical trials ( RCTs ) for depression . METHODS RCTs were identified through a MEDLINE search for trials published between January 1 and December 31 , 2007 , and a Clinical trials.gov search of self-identified interventional studies to treat depression . RESULTS Of the 150 RCTs for depression published in 2007 , 15 % did not report the gender composition of their sample , 50 % of studies did not analyze outcomes by gender , and 12 % controlled for gender but did not analyze for gender differences . Of the 768 trials review ed on Clinical trials.gov , 89 % reported recruiting male and female participants , yet < 1 % reported an intention to analyze results by gender . CONCLUSIONS Many recent studies of depression treatments include women but do not examine outcomes by gender . Underst and ing how women differ from men in response to treatment is critical for enhancing treatment efficacy for the greatest number of adults with depression. ABSTRACT  BACKGROUND In trachoma control programmes , azithromycin is distributed to treat the strains of chlamydia that cause ocular disease . We aim ed to compare the effect of annual versus twice-yearly distribution of azithromycin on infection with these strains . R and om assignment was done with the R AND OM and SORT functions of Microsoft Excel . All individuals were offered their assigned treatment of a single , directly observed , oral dose of azithromycin . Our analysis was by intention to treat . This study is registered with Clinical Trials.gov , number NCT00322972 . INTERPRETATION After 42 months of treatment , the prevalence of ocular infection with chlamydia was similar in the groups treated annually and twice yearly . However , elimination of infection might have been more rapid in the groups of villages that received treatment twice yearly . FUNDING National Institutes of Health ( NEI U10 EY016214 ). ABSTRACT  BACKGROUND Atherosclerotic renal-artery stenosis is a common problem in the elderly . Despite two r and omized trials that did not show a benefit of renal-artery stenting with respect to kidney function , the usefulness of stenting for the prevention of major adverse renal and cardiovascular events is uncertain . There were also no significant differences between the treatment groups in the rates of the individual components of the primary end point or in all-cause mortality . During follow-up , there was a consistent modest difference in systolic blood pressure favoring the stent group ( -2.3 mm Hg ; 95 % CI , -4.4 to -0.2 ; P=0.03 ) .

ABSTRACT  BACKGROUND Powders containing iron and other micronutrients are recommended as a strategy to prevent nutritional anaemia and other micronutrient deficiencies in children . We assessed the effects of provision of two micronutrient powder formulations , with or without zinc , to children in Pakistan . METHODS We did a cluster r and omised trial in urban and rural sites in Sindh , Pakistan . Children in the clusters aged 6 months were eligible for inclusion in the study . Powders were to be given daily between 6 and 18 months of age ; follow-up was to age 2 years . Parents knew whether their child was receiving supplementation , but did not know whether the powder contained zinc . Primary outcomes were growth , episodes of diarrhoea , acute lower respiratory tract infection , fever , and incidence of admission to hospital . This trial is registered with Clinical Trials.gov , number NCT00705445 . RESULTS The trial was done between Nov 1 , 2008 , and Dec 31 , 2011 . 947 children were enrolled in group A clusters , 910 in group B clusters , and 889 in group C clusters . Incidence of febrile episodes or admission to hospital for diarrhoea , respiratory problems , or febrile episodes did not differ between the three groups .

ABSTRACT  Patients ( age range , 16 to 80 years ) had tumor stage T1 to T3 , with possible spread to nearby lymph nodes but without metastasis . End points were the rate of success of ablation at 6 to 9 months , adverse events , quality of life , and length of hospital stay . RESULTS A total of 438 patients underwent r and omization ; data could be analyzed for 421 . All 95 % confidence intervals for the differences were within \\u00b110 percentage points , indicating noninferiority . Similar results were found for low-dose radioiodine plus thyrotropin alfa ( 84.3 % ) versus high-dose radioiodine plus thyroid hormone withdrawal ( 87.6 % ) or high-dose radioiodine plus thyrotropin alfa ( 90.2 % ) . More patients in the high-dose group than in the low-dose group were hospitalized for at least 3 days ( 36.3 % vs. 13.0 % , P<0.001 ) . CONCLUSIONS Low-dose radioiodine plus thyrotropin alfa was as effective as high-dose radioiodine , with a lower rate of adverse events .

Secondary end points included the time to viral suppression , the change from baseline in CD4 + T-cell count , safety , and viral resistance . RESULTS A total of 833 participants received at least one dose of study drug . No participants in the DTG-ABC-3TC group had detectable antiviral resistance ; one tenofovir DF-associated mutation and four efavirenz-associated mutations were detected in participants with virologic failure in the EFV-TDF-FTC group . CONCLUSIONS Dolutegravir plus abacavir-lamivudine had a better safety profile and was more effective through 48 weeks than the regimen with efavirenz-tenofovir DF-emtricitabine .

Studies where individuals were not the unit of analysis , those begun before 1994 , and those not receiving federal funding were excluded . PubMed search located 512 published articles . After exclusion of ineligible articles , 86 ( 17 % ) remained for analysis . RESULTS Thirty studies were sex specific . The  median enrollment of women in the 56 studies that included both men and women was 37 % . Seventy-five percent of the studies did not report any outcomes by sex , including 9 studies reporting < 20 % women enrolled . Only 3 studies indicated that the generalizability of their results may be limited by lack of diversity among those studied . There were no statistically significant changes in inclusion or reporting of sex or race/ethnicity when compared with 2004 .. ABSTRACT  BACKGROUND Maintenance therapy , often with azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil , is required to consoli date remission and prevent relapse after the initial control of lupus nephritis . The study group underwent repeat r and omization in a 1:1 ratio . Up to 10 mg of prednisone per day or its equivalent was permitted . Secondary assessment s included the time to the individual components of treatment failure and adverse events . RESULTS A total of 227 patients were r and omly assigned to maintenance treatment ( 116 to mycophenolate mofetil and 111 to azathioprine ) . Observed rates of treatment failure were 16.4 % ( 19 of 116 patients ) in the mycophenolate mofetil group and 32.4 % ( 36 of 111 ) in the azathioprine group . Adverse events , most commonly minor infections and gastrointestinal disorders , occurred in more than 95 % of the patients in both groups ( P = 0.68 ) . CONCLUSIONS Mycophenolate mofetil was superior to azathioprine in maintaining a renal response to treatment and in preventing relapse in patients with lupus nephritis who had a response to induction therapy .

ABSTRACT  BACKGROUND Exclusive breastfeeding ( EBF ) is reported to be a life-saving intervention in low-income setting s. The effect of breastfeeding counselling by peer counsellors was assessed in Africa . In the intervention group , we scheduled one antenatal breastfeeding peer counselling visit and four post-delivery visits by trained peers . The data gathering team were masked to the intervention allocation . The primary outcomes were prevalance of EBF and diarrhoea reported by mothers for infants aged 12 weeks and 24 weeks . Country-specific prevalence ratios were adjusted for cluster effects and sites . Analysis was by intention to treat . This study is registered with Clinical Trials.gov , number NCT00397150 .. ABSTRACT  BACKGROUND Bacteraemia is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in critically ill children . Units switched to the alternative bathing method for a second 6-month period . 6482 admissions were screened for eligibility . The primary outcome was an episode of bacteraemia . We did intention-to-treat ( ITT ) and per- protocol ( PP ) analyses . This study is registered with Clinical Trials.gov ( identifier NCT00549393 ) . 4947 admissions were eligible for analysis .

ABSTRACT  BACKGROUND Stroke is common during the first few weeks after a transient ischemic attack ( TIA ) or minor ischemic stroke . Combination therapy with clopidogrel and aspirin may provide greater protection against subsequent stroke than aspirin alone . All participants received open-label aspirin at a clinician-determined dose of 75 to 300 mg on day 1 . The primary outcome was stroke ( ischemic or hemorrhagic ) during 90 days of follow-up in an intention-to-treat analysis . Treatment differences were assessed with the use of a Cox proportional-hazards model , with study center as a r and om effect .

ABSTRACT  In view of the few treatment options and the potential toxicity associated with lifelong ART , in the CHER trial we compared early time-limited ART with deferred ART . The r and omisation schedule was stratified by clinical site with permuted blocks of r and om sizes to balance the numbers of infants allocated to each group . Combination therapy of lopinavir-ritonavir , zidovudine , and lamivudine was the first-line treatment regimen at ART initiation and re-initiation . The primary endpoint was time to failure of first-line ART ( immunological , clinical , or virological ) or death . Comparisons were done by intention-to-treat analysis , with use of time-to-event methods . This trial is registered with Clinical Trials.gov , number NCT00102960 . Median follow-up was 4\\u00b78 years ; 34 infants ( 9 % ) were lost to follow-up . Median time to ART initiation in the ART-Def group was 20 weeks ( IQR 16 - 25 ) . Proportions of follow-up time spent on ART were 81 % in the ART-Def group , 70 % in the ART-40W group , and 69 % in the ART-96W group . Three children in ART-Def , three in ART-40W , and one in ART-96W switched to second-line ART . Longer time on primary ART permits longer subsequent interruption , with marginally better outcomes .

We investigated whether combination therapy with glucocorticoids plus N-acetylcysteine would improve survival . METHODS We r and omly assigned 174 patients to receive prednisolone plus N-acetylcysteine ( 85 patients ) or only prednisolone ( 89 patients ) . All patients received 4 weeks of prednisolone . The prednisolone-only group received an infusion in 1000 ml of 5 % glucose solution per day on days 1 through 5 . The primary outcome was 6-month survival . RESULTS Mortality was not significantly lower in the prednisolone-N-acetylcysteine group than in the prednisolone-only group at 6 months ( 27 % vs. 38 % , P = 0.07 ) . Mortality was significantly lower at 1 month ( 8 % vs. 24 % , P = 0.006 ) but not at 3 months ( 22 % vs. 34 % , P = 0.06 ) . Infections were less frequent in the prednisolone-N-acetylcysteine group than in the prednisolone-only group ( P = 0.001 ) ; other side effects were similar in the two groups .

ABSTRACT  BACKGROUND Most patients who have had a stroke are dependent on informal caregivers for activities of daily living . METHODS We undertook a pragmatic , multicentre , cluster r and omised controlled trial with a parallel cost-effectiveness analysis . Patients with a diagnosis of stroke , likely to return home with residual disability and with a caregiver providing support were eligible . The primary outcome for caregivers was self-reported burden at 6 months , measured with the caregivers burden scale ( CBS ) . We combined patient and caregiver costs with primary outcomes and quality -adjusted life-years ( QALYs ) to assess cost-effectiveness . This trial is registered with controlled-trials.com , number IS RCT N 49208824 . FINDINGS We assessed 49 stroke units for eligibility , of which 36 were r and omly assigned to either the intervention group or the control group . Probabilities of cost-effectiveness based on QALYs were low . INTERPRETATION In a large scale , robust evaluation , results from this study have shown no differences between the LSCTC and usual care on any of the assessed outcomes . The immediate period after stroke might not be the ideal time to deliver structured caregiver training . FUNDING Medical Research Council. ABSTRACT  Differential enrollment into clinical trials by gender has been described previously . In 1993 , the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) Revitalization Act was enacted to promote the inclusion of women in clinical trials . A systematic search was conducted of all articles published in the Original Articles section of The New Engl and Journal of Medicine from 1994 to 1999 . On average , 24.6 % women were enrolled . Gender-specific data analysis was performed in 14 % of the trials .. ABSTRACT  The primary composite end point was the time until death from cardiovascular causes or major thrombotic events . The secondary end points were cardiovascular events , cardiovascular hospitalizations , incidence of cancer , progression to myelofibrosis , myelodysplasia or leukemic transformation , and hemorrhage . An intention-to-treat analysis was performed . There was no significant between-group difference in the rate of adverse events .

ABSTRACT  Pilot studies of treatment with arsenic trioxide with or without ATRA have shown high efficacy and reduced hematologic toxicity . The study was design ed as a noninferiority trial to show that the difference between the rates of event-free survival at 2 years in the two groups was not greater than 5 % . The median follow-up was 34.4 months . Overall survival was also better with ATRA-arsenic trioxide ( P=0.02 ) . As compared with ATRA-chemotherapy , ATRA-arsenic trioxide was associated with less hematologic toxicity and fewer infections but with more hepatic toxicity . CONCLUSIONS ATRA plus arsenic trioxide is at least not inferior and may be superior to ATRA plus chemotherapy in the treatment of patients with low-to-intermediate-risk APL .

ABSTRACT  BACKGROUND Among patients with Alzheimer 's disease who have had a response to antipsychotic medication for psychosis or agitation-aggression , the risk of a recurrence of symptoms after discontinuation of the medication has not been established . METHODS Patients with Alzheimer 's disease and psychosis or agitation-aggression received open-label treatment with risperidone for 16 weeks . The primary outcome was the time to relapse of psychosis or agitation . RESULTS A total of 180 patients received open-label  risperidone ( mean dose , 0.97 mg daily ) . The severity of psychosis and agitation were reduced , although there was a mild increase in extrapyramidal signs ;  112 patients met the criteria for response to treatment , of whom 110 underwent r and omization . CONCLUSIONS In patients with Alzheimer 's disease who had psychosis or agitation that had responded to risperidone therapy for 4 to 8 months , discontinuation of risperidone was associated with an increased risk of relapse .

ABSTRACT  Semagacestat is a small-molecule \\u03b3-secretase inhibitor that was developed as a potential treatment for Alzheimer 's disease . A mixed-model repeated- measures analysis was used . RESULTS The trial was terminated before completion on the basis of a recommendation by the data and safety monitoring board . At termination , there were 189 patients in the group receiving placebo  , 153 patients in the group receiving 100 mg of semagacestat , and 121 patients in the group receiving 140 mg of semagacestat . CONCLUSIONS As compared with placebo , semagacestat did not improve cognitive status , and patients receiving the higher dose had significant worsening of functional ability . Semagacestat was associated with more adverse events , including skin cancers and infections . ( Funded by Eli Lilly ; Clinical Trials.gov number , NCT00594568 .. ABSTRACT  BACKGROUND Interferon-free regimens would be a major advance in the treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) infection . The primary end point was a sustained virologic response 12 weeks after the completion of therapy . The sustained virologic response 12 weeks after the completion of therapy did not differ significantly according to treatment duration or dosage among ribavirin-containing regimens . This response was significantly higher with TID28W than with TID28W-NR ( P=0.03 ) . Rash , photosensitivity , nausea , vomiting , and diarrhea were the most common adverse events .

ABSTRACT  BACKGROUND The treatment of relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) has result ed in few durable remissions . Bruton 's tyrosine kinase ( BTK ) , an essential component of B-cell-receptor signaling , mediates interactions with the tumor microenvironment and promotes the survival and proliferation of CLL cells . A total of 85 patients , the majority of whom were considered to have high-risk disease , received ibrutinib orally once daily ; 51 received 420 mg , and 34 received 840 mg . The response was independent of clinical and genomic risk factors present before treatment , including advanced-stage disease , the number of previous therapies , and the 17p13.1 deletion . At 26 months , the estimated progression-free survival rate was 75 % and the rate of overall survival was 83 % . CONCLUSIONS Ibrutinib was associated with a high frequency of durable remissions in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL and small lymphocytic lymphoma , including patients with high-risk genetic lesions .

ABSTRACT  BACKGROUND For patients with smoldering multiple myeloma , the st and ard of care is observation until symptoms develop . However , this approach does not identify high-risk patients who may benefit from early intervention . The primary end point was time to progression to symptomatic disease . Secondary end points were response rate , overall survival , and safety . A partial response or better was achieved in 79 % of patients in the treatment group after the induction phase and in 90 % during the maintenance phase . Toxic effects were mainly grade 2 or lower . CONCLUSIONS Early treatment for patients with high-risk smoldering myeloma delays progression to active disease and increases overall survival .

ABSTRACT  We assessed cardiovascular outcomes with alogliptin , a new inhibitor of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 ( DPP-4 ) , as compared with placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes who had had a recent acute coronary syndrome . RESULTS A total of 5380 patients underwent r and omization and were followed for up to 40 months ( median , 18 months ) . Glycated hemoglobin levels were significantly lower with alogliptin than with placebo ( mean difference , -0.36 percentage points ; P<0.001 ) . Incidences of hypoglycemia , cancer , pancreatitis , and initiation of dialysis were similar with alogliptin and placebo .

ABSTRACT  BACKGROUND Although P2Y12 antagonists are effective in patients with non-ST-segment elevation ( NSTE ) acute coronary syndromes , the effect of the timing of administration -- before or after coronary angiography -- is not known . We evaluated the effect of administering the P2Y12 antagonist prasugrel at the time of diagnosis versus administering it after the coronary angiography if percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) was indicated . Patients were r and omly assigned to receive prasugrel ( a 30-mg loading dose ) before the angiography ( pretreatment group ) or placebo ( control group ) . When PCI was indicated , an additional 30 mg of prasugrel was given in the pretreatment group at the time of PCI and 60 mg of prasugrel was given in the control group . The rates of TIMI major bleeding and life-threatening bleeding not related to CABG were increased by a factor of 3 and 6 , respectively . Pretreatment did not reduce the rate of the primary outcome among patients undergoing PCI ( 69 % of the patients ) but increased the rate of TIMI major bleeding at 7 days . All the results were confirmed at 30 days and in prespecified subgroups . ( Funded by Daiichi Sankyo and Eli Lilly ; ACCOAST Clinical Trials.gov number , NCT01015287 . ). ABSTRACT  BACKGROUND Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ( IPF ) is a progressive , fatal disorder of unknown cause with no effective treatment .

The European R and omized study of Screening for Prostate cancer ( ERSPC ) was initiated in 1994 . Eight countries including France are participating . Men aged 50 - 74 and living in the Tarn or H\\u00e9rault were included . In case of PSA greater than or equal to 3 ng/ml , biopsy was recommended . Included men in both screening and control group were followed through cancer registries . Participation rate was 36.9 % in Tarn and 24.3 % in H\\u00e9rault . Corresponding RR for Tarn and H\\u00e9rault were 1.37 and 1.20 respectively . CONCLUSION Participation rate at first round was modest . Profile of men who participated compared to men who did not were different . The control group was probably contaminated by PSA testing outside study protocol . Consequences at ERSPC level of this low participation rate on final analysis remain to be determined. ABSTRACT  The design is a multicenter , two-armed , r and omized trial with 37,000 females and 37,000 males in each of the two arms . In the intervention arm , the  PSA and CA125 tests  are performed at entry , then annually for 5 years . The  DRE , TVU , and chest X-ray exams  are performed at entry and then annually for 3 years . Sigmoidoscopy is performed at entry and then at the 5-year point . This paper describes eligibility , consent , and other design features of the trial , r and omization and screening procedures , and an outline of the follow-up procedures . Sample -size calculations are reported , and a data analysis plan is presented. ABSTRACT  We evaluated mortality results in the Finnish Prostate Cancer Screening Trial , the largest component of ERSPC . The primary endpoint was PC-specific mortality . Men in the CA received usual care . The analysis covers follow-up to 12 years from r and omization for all men . Hazard ratios ( HRs ) were estimated for incidence and mortality using Cox proportional hazard model . All statistical tests were two-sided . To avoid one PC death , we needed to invite 1199 men to screening and to detect 25 PCs . We observed no difference in all-cause mortality between trial arms .. ABSTRACT  BACKGROUND Prostate cancer is one of the leading causes of death from malignant disease among men in the developed world . One strategy to decrease the risk of death from this disease is screening with prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) ; however , the extent of benefit and harm with such screening is under continuous debate . The primary endpoint was prostate-cancer specific mortality , analysed according to the intention-to-screen principle . The study is ongoing , with men who have not reached the upper age limit invited for PSA testing . This is the first planned report on cumulative prostate-cancer incidence and mortality calculated up to Dec 31 , 2008 . This study is registered as an International St and ard R and omised Controlled Trial IS RCT N54449243 . FINDINGS In each group , 48 men were excluded from the analysis because of death or emigration before the r and omisation date , or prevalent prostate cancer . In men r and omised to screening , 7578 ( 76 % ) of 9952 attended at least once . The rate ratio for death from prostate cancer was 0.56 ( 95 % CI 0.39 - 0.82 ; p=0.002 ) in the screening compared with the control group . The rate ratio of death from prostate cancer for attendees compared with the control group was 0.44 ( 95 % CI 0.28 - 0.68 ; p=0.0002 ) . INTERPRETATION This study shows that prostate cancer mortality was reduced almost by half over 14 years . However , the risk of over-diagnosis is substantial and the number needed to treat is at least as high as in breast-cancer screening programmes . The benefit of prostate-cancer screening compares favourably to other cancer screening programs .

ABSTRACT  Objective To assess whether screening for prostate cancer reduces prostate cancer specific mortality . Design Population based r and omised controlled trial . Setting Department of Urology , Norrk\\u00f6ping , and the South-East Region Prostate Cancer Register . These men were invited to be screened every third year from 1987 to 1996 . On the first two occasions screening was done by digital rectal examination only . From 1993 , this was combined with prostate specific antigen testing , with 4 \\u00b5g/L as cut off . On the fourth occasion ( 1996 ) , only men aged 69 or under at the time of the investigation were invited . Prostate cancer specific mortality up to 31 December 2008 . There were 85 cases ( 5.7 % ) of prostate cancer diagnosed in the screened group and 292 ( 3.9 % ) in the control group . After adjustment for age at start of the study , the hazard ratio was 1.58 ( 1.06 to 2.36 ; P=0.024 ) . Trial registration Current Controlled Trials , IS RCT N06342431. ABSTRACT  This is the first report from the Prostate , Lung , Colorectal , and Ovarian ( PLCO ) Cancer Screening Trial on prostate-cancer mortality . Men in the screening group were offered annual PSA testing for 6 years and digital rectal examination for 4 years . The subjects and health care providers received the results and decided on the type of follow-up evaluation . Usual care sometimes included screening , as some organizations have recommended . The numbers of all cancers and deaths and causes of death were ascertained . RESULTS In the screening group , rates of compliance were 85 % for PSA testing and 86 % for digital rectal examination . The data at 10 years were 67 % complete and consistent with these overall findings . ( Clinical Trials.gov number , NCT00002540 .. ABSTRACT  Mortality after 7 - 10 years of follow-up has been reported previously . We report extended follow-up to 13 years after the trial . Screening was completed in October 2006 . All incident prostate cancers and deaths from prostate cancer through 13 years of follow-up or through December 31 , 2009 , were ascertained . All statistical tests were two-sided . RESULTS Approximately 92 % of the study participants were followed to 10 years and 57 % to 13 years . At 13 years , 4250 participants had been diagnosed with prostate cancer in the intervention arm compared with 3815 in the control arm .. ABSTRACT  PURPOSE This clinical trial is aim ed at evaluating the impact of prostate cancer screening on cancer-specific mortality . At follow-up visits , serum PSA only was used . Median follow-up of screened men was 7.93 years . These results are in agreement with the continuous decrease of prostate cancer mortality observed in North America. ABSTRACT  BACKGROUND The incidence of prostate cancer has increased substantially since it became common practice to screen asymptomatic men for the disease . Variations in the screening algorithm , such as the interval between screening rounds , likely influence the morbidity , mortality , and quality of life of the screened population . All participants who were diagnosed with prostate cancer through December 31 , 2005 , but at most 10 years after the initial screening were ascertained by linkage with the national cancer registries . We used Mantel Cox regression to assess differences between rates of interval cancers and aggressive interval cancers at the two centers . All statistical tests were two-sided . CONCLUSION The rate of interval cancer , especially aggressive interval cancer , was low in this study . The 2-year screening interval had higher detection rates than the 4-year interval but did not lead to lower rates of interval and aggressive interval prostate cancers. ABSTRACT  All men r and omized were included , only those with prostate cancer screen\\u2010detected or clinical ly diagnosed before July 1997 were omitted from the analyses . These rates were higher than those recorded at the national and regional levels , 33 and 38 per 1,000 person\\u2010years , respectively . An opposite pattern was observed in the screening arm , where participants already had received the scheduled screening within the trial . Over a 4\\u2010year rescreening interval , the average PSA and effective contamination amount were approximately 28 % and 10 % , respectively . PSA testing in the control arm in the Rotterdam ERSPC section is high , but was not followed by a substantial increase in prostate biopsies . \\u00a9 2003 Wiley\\u2010Liss ,. ABSTRACT  Date s and causes of death were collected on an annual basis . A Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to calculate overall and cancer-specific survival . RESULTS A total of 2,416 men were recruited in the screening arm and 1,862 in the control arm . Mean age was 57.8 years , median follow-up was 13.3 years . At the end of the follow-up period , 427 deaths ( 9 from PCa ) were observed . Most relevant causes of death were malignant tumors ( 52.9 % ) , cardiovascular disease ( 17.3 % ) and respiratory ( 8.9 % ) . Only 2.1 % of deaths ( 0.2 % of all recruited men ) were due to PCa ( 2.5 % screening , 1.6 % control ) . CONCLUSIONS The Spanish arm of ERSPC failed to reproduce the long-term results shown in the whole study . No differences in mortality ( overall or cancer-specific ) were observed after 15 years of follow-up . PCa mortality was infrequent ( less than 1 % ) . These results suggest limited yield of PCa screening in our setting. ABSTRACT  Screening for prostate cancer ( PC ) remains a controversial issue despite some new evidence on the mortality benefits of PC screening . We conducted a prospect i ve , r and omized screening trial in Finl and to investigate whether screening decreases PC incidence . Here , we report the incidence results from three screening rounds during a 12-year period . The mean follow-up time for PC incidence in both arms was over 9 years . The incidence of localized PC was 7.5 in the SA and 4.6 in the CA , IRR = 1.6 ( 1.5 - 1.7 ) . The results from our large population -based trial indicate that screening for PC decreases the incidence of advanced PC . When compared with the CA , the PC detected in the SA there were substantially more often localized , low- grade PCs due to overdiagnosis. ABSTRACT  To report the results from  Switzerl and 's participation in the ERSPC from 1998 ; importantly , epidemiological data showed that Switzerl and has one of the highest rates of morbidity and mortality from prostate cancer in the world . The local study protocol was accepted by the ethical committee and after the successful pilot study phase , the centre joined the ERSPC. ABSTRACT  Men were screened with PSA test at a 2 - 7 year interval depending on the centre ; PSA cut-off was 3.0 - 4.0 ng/ml . A positive screen with no histologically confirmed PC in biopsy within 1 year was defined as an FP result . RESULTS Of the 61,604 men who were screened at least once , 17.8 % had one or more FP result ( s ) . Almost 20 % of men who participated at all screening rounds had one or more FP result ( s ) . More than half of the men with an FP result had another FP if screened again . The PCs following an FP result were in 92.8 % of cases localised and low- grade versus 90.4 % following a screen-negative result . False-positive men are more prone to be diagnosed with PC but are also likely to have consistently high PSA levels. ABSTRACT  However , results analyzed by comorbidity strata remain unknown . RESULTS After 10 years of follow-up , 9,565 deaths occurred , 164 from PC . CONCLUSION Selective use of PSA screening for men in good health appears to reduce the risk of PCSM with minimal overtreatment. ABSTRACT  The specific details of the French national programme are based on the design of a local mass screening programme . The protocol includes r and omization before information and consent . In addition , knowledge of any pre\\u2010existing PSA test is obtained through the health insurance data base .. ABSTRACT  Centres recruit different age groups and have different design s for recruiting and countries have different underlying risks for prostate cancer . Recruitment has reached 163,126 men aged 55 - 69 at entry now . Our purpose was to calculate the power of the trial and at what point in time can statistically significant differences in prostate cancer mortality be expected . Recruitment data were collected from the screening centres . We calculated the expected number of prostate cancer deaths in each follow-up year , based on national statistics and expected rate in trial entrants . The power was calculated using different assumptions on intervention effect and contamination rate and also if the ERSPC trial would cooperate with other trials . With an assumed 25 % intervention effect in men actually screened and a 20 % contamination rate , the trial will reach a power of 0.86 in 2008 . With an assumed intervention effect of 40 % , the power reaches 0.90 in 2003 - 2004 . Adding more centres with compliance rates lower than 45 % decreases the power of the trial .. ABSTRACT  The principal screening method at all centers is determination of  serum prostate\\u2010specific antigen ( PSA ) . An additional 6 % was referred for further assessment based on other criteria , with much less efficiency . Differences in PSA by country are largely attributable to the age structure of the study population . Considerable progress has been made in both trials . Enrollment will be completed in 2001 . A substantial number of early prostate cancers have been detected . The differences between countries seem to reflect both underlying prostate cancer incidence and screening policy . The trials have the power to show definitive results in 2005\\u20132008 . \\u00a9 2002 Wiley\\u2010Liss ,. ABSTRACT  Prostate cancer has become the most frequent cancer and the second cause of cancer mortality in men . This public health problem is becoming increasingly important due to the increasing life expectancy . At the present time , prostate cancer will be discovered in one in every eight men during their lifetime . Prostate cancer represents 25 % of all new cases of male cancers . Prostate cancer screening is design ed to detect early stage , asymptomatic prostate cancer , as the patient 's chances of cure are higher when the cancer is diagnosed at an early stage . The conclusions of the ANAES evaluation in 1998 did not recommend mass screening for prostate cancer . If total PSA is above the normal value of the test or if digital rectal examination is abnormal , referral to a urologist is recommended . Information concerning the limits , benefits and risks of screening and the available treatment options must be given before performing these examinations. ABSTRACT  The remaining 7532 men were treated as controls . In 1987 and 1990 only  digital rectal examination ( DRE )  was performed , in 1993 and 1996 DRE was combined with a test for Prostate-Specific Antigen ( PSA ) . TNM categories , grade of malignancy , management and cause of death were recorded in the South-East Region Prostate Cancer Register . In the SG 48 ( 56.5 % ) of the tumours and in the UG 78 ( 26.7 % ) were localised at diagnosis ( p < 0.001 ) . In the SG 21 ( 25 % ) and in the UG 41 ( 14 % ) received curative treatment . There was no significant difference in total or prostate cancer-specific survival between the groups .. ABSTRACT  OBJECTIVE To describe the natural history of initially untreated early-stage prostate cancer . A key secondary objective was to calculate long-term survival rates by stage , grade , and age at diagnosis . DESIGN Prospect i ve cohort study . SETTING Population -based in 1 county of Sweden , without screening for prostate cancer . RESULTS In the entire cohort , prostate cancer accounted for 201 ( 37 % ) of all 541 deaths . Among 300 patients with a diagnosis of localized disease ( T0-T2 ) , 33 ( 11 % ) died of prostate cancer . Without reliable prognostic indicators , an aggressive approach to all patients with early disease would entail substantial overtreatment . In contrast , patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease need trials of aggressive therapy to improve their poor prognosis. ABSTRACT  PURPOSE We evaluated long-term survival in attendees and nonattendees of a 1-time screening for prostate cancer . Of the invited men 1,782 ( 74 % ) attended . Screening attendees were examined with digital rectal examination , transrectal ultrasound and prostate specific antigen analysis . When cancer was suspected , prostate biopsies were taken . A total of 65 men with prostate cancer were detected by this procedure . RESULTS Incidence rate ratios were calculated using Poisson regression models . In contrast , the corresponding incidence rate ratio in nonattendees was 1.53 ( 95 % CI 1.37 - 1.71 ) . These findings should be considered when interpreting previous and upcoming studies of the effect of screening programs. ABSTRACT  To be effective , such a program should be able to reduce the absolute number of men diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer ( for which no cure is available ) . The aim of the present report is to evaluate whether PSA-based screening reduces the risk of being diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer . METHODS A population -based , prospect i ve , r and omized , controlled screening trial for prostate cancer started in 1995 ( the G\\u00f6teborg branch of the European R and omized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer [ ERSPC ] ) . However , the risk of being diagnosed with prostate cancer increased 1.8-fold with PSA-based screening . CONCLUSIONS Biennial PSA screening reduces the risk of being diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer , the first prerequisite for achieving decreased cancer mortality  in younger men . This putative benefit is balanced by a 1.8-fold increased risk for diagnosis of prostate cancer. ABSTRACT  To report the initial results from Sweden of a large population \\u2010based r and omized study of screening using prostate\\u2010specific antigen ( PSA ) to detect prostate cancer , as the efficacy of such screening to decrease prostate cancer mortality has not yet been proven. ABSTRACT  BACKGROUND Evidence from r and omized trials on the effects of screening for prostate cancer ( PCa ) on disease-specific mortality accumulates slowly with increasing follow-up . OBJECTIVE To assess data on PCa-specific mortality in the Rotterdam section of the European R and omized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer ( ERSPC ) trial . DESIGN , SETTING , AND PARTICIPANTS A r and omized controlled trial with r and omization after signed , written informed consent ( efficacy trial ) . OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Number of PCas detected per arm depicted by predefined time periods and prognostic groups . PCa-specific mortality analyses using Poisson regression in age group 55 - 74 yr at r and omization and separately in the predefined age group of 55 - 69 yr . Thirty-two percent of all men r and omized have died . A 14.1 % increase was found in men aged 70 - 74 yr ( not statistically significant ) . Absolute PCa mortality was 1.8 per 1000 men r and omized ( 2.6 per 1000 men r and omized in age group 55 - 69 yr ) . The number needed to invite and number needed to manage were 565 and 33 , respectively , for age group 55 - 74 yr , and 392 and 24 , respectively , for age group 65 - 69 yr . Given the slow natural history of the disease , follow-up might be too short . CONCLUSIONS Systematic PSA-based screening reduced PCa-specific mortality by 32 % in the age range of 55 - 69 yr . The roughly twofold higher incidence in the S-arm underlines the importance of tools to better identify those men who would benefit from screening\",\n          \" BACKGROUND There is increased pressure on primary care physicians to monitor oral anticoagulation . METHODS A r and omized , controlled trial in 12 primary care practice s in Birmingham , Engl and ( 9 intervention and 3 control ) . Intervention practice s ' patients were r and omized to the intervention ( practice -based anticoagulation clinic ) or control ( hospital clinic ) group . The main outcome measure was therapeutic control of the international normalized ratio . St and ard measures of control of the international normalized ratio ( point prevalence ) showed no significant difference between the intervention and control groups . Care given by this model is at least as good as routine hospital follow-up . The model is generalizable to primary health care centers operating in developed health care systems. ABSTRACT  OBJECTIVE To investigate the effect of meal-related self-monitoring of blood glucose on glycemic control and well-being in non-insulin-treated type 2 diabetic patients . RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS This 6-month study , which included 6 months of follow-up , adopted a prospect i ve , multicenter , r and omized controlled design . The primary efficacy parameter was the change in HbA(1c ) . Secondary efficacy variables included changes in body weight , lipids , and microalbumin and changes in treatment satisfaction and well-being . Body weight , total cholesterol , and microalbumin improved when using a glucometer , but there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups . Treatment satisfaction increased in both groups to a similar extent ( P = 0.9 ) . Self-monitoring result ed in a marked improvement of general well-being with significant improvements in the subitems depression ( P = 0.032 ) and lack of well-being ( P = 0.02 ) . The finding of three types of responders will be important for future planning of counseling and educational interventions. ABSTRACT  Participants might ignore follow-up , leave town , or take aspartame when instructed to take aspirin . Exclusions before r and omisation do not bias the treatment comparison , but they can hurt generalisability . Eligibility criteria for a trial should be clear , specific , and applied before r and omisation . In principle , assessment of exclusions after r and omisation is simple : none are allowed . In reality , however , losses frequently occur . Investigators can also do secondary analyses on , for instance , per- protocol or as-treated participants . Such analyses should be described as secondary and non-r and omised comparisons . Mish and ling of exclusions causes serious method ological difficulties . Creative mismanagement of exclusions can undermine trial validity. ABSTRACT  CONTEXT Control of oral anticoagulation therapy has been reported to often be inadequate . Previous retrospective investigations suggest that patients ' self-adjustment of oral anticoagulants may lead to improved control . OBJECTIVE To investigate the effects of patients ' self-management of oral anticoagulation therapy on accuracy of control and measures of treatment-related quality of life . DESIGN R and omized , single-blind , multicenter trial . SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS A total of 179 patients receiving long-term oral anticoagulation treatment were enrolled at 5 referral centers in Germany . The control group received conventional care as provided by family physicians , including referral to specialists if necessary . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Deviation of INR values from the individual INR target range ( squared ) and the 5 categories of treatment-related quality of life . Also , the intervention group had INR values within the target range more often ( repeated measurement analysis for categorical data , P=.006 ) . Treatment-related quality -of-life measures , especially treatment satisfaction scores , were significantly higher in the intervention group compared with controls . Further studies are needed to describe whether the program will reduce risk of bleeding or thromboembolism. ABSTRACT  Fifty-four patients with type II diabetes mellitus , not treated with insulin , who had inadequate glucose control on diet aloneor diet and oral hypoglycemic agents were studied . Patients performed SMBG or urine glucose testing as part of a st and ardized treatment program that also included diet and exercise counseling . Seventeen ( 31 % ) of54 patients actually normalized their glycosylated hemoglobin values , 9 in the urine-testing group and 8 in the SMBG group . Comparisons between the urine-testing and SMBG groups showed no significant differences in mean fasting plasma glucose ( P > 0.86 ) , glycosylated hemoglobin ( P > 0.95 ) , or weight ( P < 0.19 ) . In patients with type II diabetes mellitus not treated with insulin , SMBG is no more effective , but is 8\\u201312 times more expensive , thanurine testing in facilitating improved glycemic control . Our results do not support widespread use of SMBG in diabetic patients not treated with insulin. ABSTRACT  Small portable devices have enabled patient self-monitoring of anticoagulation and self-adjustment of the dose . Patients were self-managed or were managed by the anticoagulation clinic for a period of 3 months . After this period the alternative strategy was followed for each patient . The primary endpoint was the number of measurements within the therapeutic range ( therapeutic target value + /-50.5 INR units ) . FINDINGS There was no significant difference in the overall quality of control of anticoagulation between the two study periods . The proportion of patients who spent most time in the therapeutic target range was larger during self-management than during anticoagulation clinic-guided management . A patient-satisfaction assessment showed superiority of self-management over conventional care . It is also better appreciated by patients . Larger studies are required to assess the effect of this novel management strategy on the incidence of thromboembolic or bleeding complications. ABSTRACT  OBJECTIVE To compare the effect of SM with physician-management ( PM ) on the maintenance of therapeutic anticoagulation . METHODS A r and omized , open-label eight-month trial was performed . Exclusion criteria were a known hypercoaguable disorder , mental incompetence , a language barrier or an inability to attend training sessions . Patients r and omly assigned to PM received usual care from their general practitioner . The primary outcome was to demonstrate 20 % improvement in anticoagulation control by SM . RESULTS One hundred forty patients were r and omly assigned ( 70 per group ) . Thirteen patients dropped out of SM early due to an inability to self-manage . Patients managing their own therapy spent less time below the therapeutic range ( 15.0 % versus 27.3 % , P=0.04 ) . There were three major complications of thrombosis or bleeding , all occurring in the PM arm . All patients who completed SM preferred to continue with that strategy . CONCLUSIONS SM was not significantly better than PM in maintaining therapeutic anticoagulation . SM was feasible and appeared safe in the present study population. ABSTRACT  A diabetes protocol characterized by self-monitoring of blood glucose was introduced in four general practice s with the aim of making the frequency of consultations dependent on the metabolic regulation and emphasizing body weight reduction . The feasibility of the programme was investigated and the results after 1 year were compared with those of conventional care in four control practice s. In the experimental practice s , 13 patients switched from a medical specialist 's to a general practitioner 's supervision  , 20 remained under supervision of their GP  and 33 started self-monitoring . The self-monitoring rate , the consultation frequency according to protocol , the low number of dropouts and inadequate referrals and adherence to the therapeutic scheme showed that the protocol was feasible for both the GPs and the patients . At the initial assessment , the regulation of the diabetes was worse in patients of the experimental group , compared with those of the control group ( mean HbA1 9.7 % vs 8.9 % ; p less than 0.05 ) . On average , patients in the experimental group ( n = 56 ) lost 0.4 kg of body weight , whereas those in the control group ( n = 73 ) gained 0.1 kg ( n.s . ) The mean change in HbA1 , adjusted for the initial value , was -0.4 % in the experimental and + 0.5 % in the control group ( p less than 0.05 ) . The results of the protocol can be attributed to a combination of greater participation of the patient , the individualized consultation frequency and the prescription of oral hypoglycaemic agents according to body weight development. ABSTRACT  Self-monitoring of blood glucose levels is currently being recommended for obese patients with type II diabetes to improve weight loss and glycemic control . Both groups lost significant amounts of weight and maintained their losses for at least one year ; reductions in medication could be made for 70 percent of patients . These data suggest that the behavioral weight control used in this study may be of benefit to patients with type II diabetes . However , there was no evidence that the addition of self-monitoring of blood glucose levels to the treatment program improved the outcome in terms of weight loss , reduction in medication , dietary compliance , or mood state. ABSTRACT  Two thous and patients suitable for self-management will be assigned at r and om to either the self-management group or the control group . The numbers of thromboembolic and hemorrhagic complications requiring treatment during the 2-year follow-up period will be recorded as the primary end point . The secondary endpoint variables will be maintenance of the INR value in the individual target range , INR variance , the course of complications over time , and the cost efficiency of self-management compared with the routine procedures . The last of these parameters will include the diagnostic and /or therapeutic measures carried out , the duration of inpatient hospital treatment , and the social consequences ( subsequent rehabilitation treatment , inability to work , forced retirement ) . Since this rate can be halved by self-management , a one-tailed chi 2-test of 80 % power and a 5 % significance threshold would require n = 997 patients per group . The results of the SMAAF study will establish the socioeconomic benefits of self-management in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. ABSTRACT  RESULTS Almost 80 % of the INR values recorded by patients at home were within the stipulated therapeutic range , INR 2.5 to 4.5 , compared with just 62 % of INR values recorded by family practitioners . The overall complication rate ( hemorrhages and thromboembolic events ) of the self-management group was significantly ( p < 0.05 ) decreased compared with the conventional group . CONCLUSIONS Through INR self-management , an improvement in the quality of ongoing oral anticoagulation could be shown . Starting this form of therapeutic control early after mechanical heart valve replacement appears to effect a further reduction in anticoagulant-induced complications. ABSTRACT  BACKGROUND Several studies have demonstrated that patient self-management of oral anticoagulant therapy ( OAT )  can improve treatment quality . However , most of these studies were not conducted within a specialized anticoagulation care system . The objective of the present study was to determine whether patient self-management of OAT improves the quality of care delivered by anticoagulation clinics . RESULTS Only 25.6 % of invited patients agreed to participate in the training program . Patients who remained in the existing care group were within the international normalized ratio target range 63.5 % of the time . The type of coumarin taken was a major predicting factor of OAT quality . In all study groups phenprocoumon outperformed acenocoumarol by 11.6 % ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 6.6%-16.5 % ) . Weekly management with acenocoumarol did not improve the quality of OAT . CONCLUSION With selected patients , the quality of OAT obtained through patient self-management is at least as high as that delivered by specialized physicians at anticoagulation clinics . Weekly management of OAT with long-acting phenprocoumon has to be preferred at anticoagulation clinics or , where possible , through patient self-management. ABSTRACT  At the end of the study period , the decrease of HbA1c over six months -- main endpoint -- was not significantly different between the three groups ( mean + /- SEM ; group A : -0.5 + /- 0.2 % ; group B : -0.1 + /- 0.3 % ; group C : -0.4 + /- 0.3 % ) . However , the degree of compliance to  blood glucose self-monitoring  in group C appeared to relate to the outcome : a significant correlation was found between the number of blood glucose strips used and the decrease of HbA1c ( r = .36 , p less than .02 ) . We conclude that regular self-monitoring has no definite advantage over the usual management for improving metabolic control in non-insulin-treated diabetic patients , though it may possibly help patients ready to comply with its use. ABSTRACT  Baseline hemoglobin HbA 1c ranged between 9.5 % and 13.5 % ( normal range 5.5%\\u20137.7 % ) . Subjects were matched for weight , sex , and HbAlc and assigned to small ( 4\\u20138 participants ) groups which met weekly for 12 weeks and then monthly for 16 weeks . After 8 weeks , the group were r and omized either to continue the behavioral program or to have SMBG and dietary CHO counting . Weight loss was identical in both groups during the year of follow-up . The HbA1c level showed a progressive decline in experimental subjects ( P<0.05 ) , whereas there was no improvement in control subjects. ABSTRACT  Design Multicentre open r and omised controlled trial . Setting Midl and s region of the UK . Main outcome measure Percentage of time spent within the therapeutic range of international normalised ratio . Self managed patients with poor control before the study showed an improvement in control that was not seen in the routine care group . It may improve the time spent the therapeutic range for patients with initially poor control . Trial registration IS RCT N 19313375. ABSTRACT  This study tested the hypothesis that follow-up intervention ( by telephone calls and home visit ) affects compliance in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus ( NIDDM ) . No significant differences were seen in post study HbA 1c values and weight changes between the two groups . Follow-up inter vention by telephone calls and home visit can enhance patient compliance to certain aspects of the prescribed diabetes management plan. ABSTRACT  STUDY OBJECTIVE To evaluate the efficacy and accuracy of monitoring prothrombin times at home . DESIGN R and omized , prospect i ve cohort study . SETTING Out patients discharged from a university hospital or a community hospital . There were no major thromboembolic or hemorrhagic complications in either group . CONCLUSIONS Use of a portable prothrombin time monitor by patients at home is feasible and provides accurate measurements . Patients doing home monitoring achieve superior anticoagulation control compared with those receiving st and ard anticoagulation clinic care. ABSTRACT  Context Although many out patients require oral anticoagulation , the optimal management of outpatient anticoagulation remains uncertain . The Editors Indications for oral anticoagulant treatment to prevent thromboembolic disease have increased in recent years ( 1 ) . The establishment of accurate therapeutic INR ranges was also beneficial . Target ranges include the safest INR values that carry the lowest risk for hemorrhagic or thromboembolic complications ( 2 ) . Currently , portable coagulometers are available for determining INR easily and reliably ( 8) . This technology provides interesting clinical models for the control of oral anticoagulant treatment , the most promising of which are patient self-testing and patient self-management . For patient self-testing , patients measure INRs themselves and ask their referring physicians for the proper anticoagulant dose . Patient self-management assumes that patients will adjust their own doses and is the most autonomous strategy . The clinical staff includes trained nurses . Computers control the clinical data and INR records , ensuring excellent follow-up . Samsa and Matchar ( 20 ) recommended that these characteristics be used to provide an appropriate control group in a trial on patient self-management . The institutional review board of our hospital approved the study . Once the patient ( or his or her caregiver ) agreed to participate , written informed consent was obtained . Next , central ized telephone r and omization assigned the patient to the experimental group ( patient self-management ) or to the control group ( conventional management ) . The allocation sequence was generated at the hospital 's epidemiology department , and the sequence of r and omization was concealed until the patient was assigned to a group . Members of our anticoagulation clinic enrolled participants and assigned them to groups . Follow-up for patients assigned to the conventional management group was done immediately . The program consisted of 2 sessions of 2 hours each on consecutive days . A specially trained nurse was responsible for teaching the patients in small , organized groups . The lessons included basic theoretical and practical concepts involving the use of a coagulometer , interpretation of INR , and adjustment of dose . The concepts of target range and dose modification were emphasized when necessary . A simple card system was design ed to help the patient select the correct dose . For each target range , a specific card was provided . Patients were taught to use the portable coagulometer CoaguChek S ( Roche Diagnostics , Mannheim , Germany ) with the appropriate reagent strips . When the INR result was out of target range , our dosing protocol indicated that we should advance the next appointment for INR testing to 1 or 2 weeks . International normalized ratio was determined by means of a st and ard KC 10 coagulometer ( Amelung , Lemgo , Germany ) . As a thromboplastin , we used Thromborel S ( Behring , Marburg , Germany ) . A hematologist experienced in oral anticoagulation management adjusted the dose and made the appointment for the next INR test . Patients in the self-management group performed the INR tests at home once per week using the CoaguChek S kit . They determined the appropriate dose of oral anticoagulant and the time of the next INR test . All of the INR results in both groups were entered into a computer ( in the central system of our anticoagulation clinic or in the portable coagulometers ) to facilitate data management . Patients in both groups were interviewed monthly by telephone to record any complications or changes in their health status . For the conventional management group , these interviews were done approximately midway between hospital visits . The questions addressed minor or major bleeding , thromboembolic events , episodic diseases , changes in long-term medications , and hospital stays . Associated complications were diagnosed and evaluated by a third physician who was not involved in the trial and was unaware of patients ' study group . St and ard criteria were used to diagnose any thromboembolic complications . Transient ischemic attack was diagnosed clinical ly by a neurologist , and superficial thrombophlebitis was diagnosed clinical ly by an angiologist . All thromboembolic complications were considered major events . Life-threatening bleeding or bleeding requiring transfusion or hospital admission was considered a major event . Any other bleeding was considered a minor event . Statistical Analysis Study outcomes were evaluated on an intention-to-treat basis and also on an on-treatment basis .. ABSTRACT  Of these , 44 were r and omized to self\\u2010monitor their INR and 41 returned to clinic . Inter\\u2010group differences were not statistically significant ( intervention groups 0\\u00b726 \\u00b1 0\\u00b730 vs. control 0\\u00b716 \\u00b1 0\\u00b73 , P = 0\\u00b710 ) . Quality \\u2010of\\u2010life measurements and health beliefs about warfarin were unchanged ( apart from emotional role limitation ) with education or education and self\\u2010monitoring . Patient  education regarding anticoagulation therapy could be a cost\\u2010effective initiative and is worthy of further study. ABSTRACT  BACKGROUND This study was conducted to assess the ability of patients receiving heart valve replacements to practice self-managed anticoagulation using a portable coagulometer . METHODS We carried out a prospect i ve , r and omized trial , comparing self-managed anticoagulation with conventional management . There was no significant difference in mortality or morbidity between the two groups . CONCLUSIONS Self-managed anticoagulation is a reliable , easily learned method of controlling anticoagulation , and it is suitable for approximately two thirds of patients , with excellent results. ABSTRACT  Bleeding is the major side effect of warfarin and is a major deterrent to its use , especially in older patients . However , there is little controlled or experimental evidence on how to optimize management of anticoagulant therapy in older patients and prevent bleeding . Eligible patients who were enrolled did not differ significantly from those who were not enrolled with regard to age , ethnicity , sex , or indication for therapy . Figure 1 . Eligibility and r and om assignment of patients . Patients were stratified according to their baseline risk for major bleeding by using the Outpatient Bleeding Risk Index ( 20 ) . After stratification , patients were r and omly assigned to receive usual care or intervention . Informed consent for observation and data collection was then sought from both groups , and informed consent to participate in the intervention was sought from the intervention group . The sample size was calculated to provide 80 % power and an level of 0.05 . The study protocol and informed consent procedures were approved by the hospital 's institutional review board . Intervention The intervention had two main components . The first component consisted of a guideline -based consultation that assessed the patient 's indications for therapy and potential risk factors for warfarin-related bleeding . We used this method previously to reduce the frequency of anticoagulant-related bleeding  during hospitalization ( 27 ) . Specific recommendations about modifiable risk factors , such as use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs , were made and implemented . The study investigators directed warfarin dosing and international normalized ratio ( INR ) testing after hospital discharge . The lay educator review ed the workbook and was taught how to use the prothrombin time monitor by one of the authors but had no formal medical training . Coaching was aim ed to increase patients ' participation in their care and to improve information-seeking skills . The monitor uses a fingerstick to obtain a blood sample and has well-established accuracy ( 36 - 38 ) . Patients were initially assessed , educated , and taught to use the portable monitor while hospitalized ; training lasted 30 minutes to 1 hour . They were seen daily while hospitalized , warfarin therapy was adjusted as needed , and any concerns or questions about anticoagulant therapy were addressed . After the 6-month intervention period , management and dosing of warfarin therapy reverted back to patients ' personal physicians . Surveillance for bleeding and thromboembolism was conducted identically in the intervention and control groups and consisted of 12 items inquiring about bleeding and thromboembolism at each follow-up interview . All date s of death were confirmed by death certificates , and all causes of death were confirmed by review of death certificates and medical records . Follow-up was complete for all patients . End Points The primary end point was the first major bleeding event during the 6-month intervention period . Bleeding was classified without information about possible risk factors or r and omization status . Two author- review ers who were blinded to group assignment adjudicated bleeding events ; their agreement was high ( statistic , 0.97 ) . The therapeutic range of the INR was defined as 2.5 to 3.5 for persons with mechanical heart valves and 2.0 to 3.0 for persons with all other indications ( 40 ) . This approach estimates the amount of time a patient is in the therapeutic range based on the actual INRs measured , assuming a linear relationship between consecutive INRs . Patients with only one. ABSTRACT  An ageing population and the continuing expansion of clinical indications for coumadin therapy have increased pressure on hospital anticoagulant clinics . One solution is patient self\\u2010testing ( PST ) of the international normalized ratio ( INR ) using capillary blood sample s on point\\u2010of\\u2010care coagulation monitors at home . We conducted a prospect i ve study to determine whether patients can achieve accurate INR values through PST , using the CoaguChek S ( Roche Diagnostics , Lewes , UK ) . The main outcome measurements were : comparability of INR values obtained by PST and the hospital laboratory , patient acceptability as assessed by a question naire and anticoagulant control . Patients were r and omized to weekly self\\u2010testing or continuing 4\\u2010weekly hospital laboratory monitoring of INR . Comparison of INRs ( n = 234 ) showed no significant differences between the CoaguChek ( median INR 3\\u00b702 ) and laboratory testing ( median INR 3\\u00b707 ) . There was excellent correlation between the two methods ( r = 0\\u00b795 ) , with 85 % of CoaguChek results within 0\\u00b75 INR units of the laboratory method . On four occasions , differences of > 1 unit INR were obtained , but in each case the patient 's anticoagulation was unstable ( INR > 4\\u00b75 by both methods ) and the differences in INR would not have altered patient management . 87 % of patients found self\\u2010testing straightforward , 87 % were confident in the result they obtained and 77 % preferred self\\u2010testing . We conclude that PST is a reliable alternative to hospital clinic attendance and is acceptable to the majority of suitably trained patients\",\n          \" BACKGROUND Actinic keratosis is a common precursor to sun-related squamous-cell carcinoma . Treating actinic keratoses and the surrounding skin area ( i.e. , field therapy ) can eradicate clinical and sub clinical actinic keratoses . Topical field therapy currently requires weeks or months of treatment . Complete clearance ( primary outcome ) was assessed at 57 days , and local reactions were quantitatively measured . Adverse events were generally mild to moderate in intensity and resolved without sequelae . CONCLUSIONS Ingenol mebutate gel applied topically for 2 to 3 days is effective for field treatment of actinic keratoses .

ABSTRACT  BACKGROUND In r and omized trials , fecal occult-blood testing reduces mortality from colorectal cancer . However , the duration of the benefit is unknown , as are the effects specific to age and sex . Screening was performed from 1976 through 1982 and from 1986 through 1992 . We used the National Death Index to obtain up date d information on the vital status of participants and to determine causes of death through 2008 . RESULTS Through 30 years of follow-up , 33,020 participants ( 70.9 % ) died . The reduction in colorectal-cancer mortality was larger for men than for women in the biennial-screening group ( P=0.04 for interaction ) . CONCLUSIONS The effect of screening with fecal occult-blood testing on colorectal-cancer mortality persists after 30 years but does not influence all-cause mortality . The sustained reduction in colorectal-cancer mortality supports the effect of polypectomy . ( Funded by the Veterans Affairs Merit Review Award Program and others . ). ABSTRACT  BACKGROUND Women 's groups and health education by peer counsellors can improve the health of mothers and children . We assessed their effects on mortality and breastfeeding rates  in rural Malawi . METHODS We did a 2 \\u00d7 2 factorial , cluster-r and omised trial in 185,888 people in Mchinji district . 48 equal-sized clusters were r and omly allocated to four groups with a computer-generated number sequence . 24 facilitators guided groups through a community action cycle to tackle maternal and child health problems . Analysis was by intention to treat . The trial is registered as IS RCT N06477126 . FINDINGS We monitored outcomes of 26,262 births between 2005 and 2009 . Because of the interaction between the two interventions , a stratified analysis was done . FUNDING Saving Newborn Lives , UK Department for International Development , and Wellcome Trust. ABSTRACT  BACKGROUND Venous thromboembolism is a common , potentially avoidable cause of death and morbidity in patients in hospital , including those with stroke . We assessed the effectiveness of IPC to reduce the risk of DVT in patients who have had a stroke . Caregivers and patients were not masked to treatment assignment . Patients were followed up for 6 months to determine survival and later symptomatic venous thromboembolism . Patients were analysed according to their treatment allocation . TRIAL REGISTRATION IS RCT N93529999 . FINDINGS Between Dec 8 , 2008 , and Sept 6 , 2012 , 2876 patients were enrolled in 94 centres in the UK . The included patients were broadly representative of immobile stroke patients admitted to hospital and had a median age of 76 years ( IQR 67 - 84 ) . INTERPRETATION IPC is an effective method of reducing the risk of DVT and possibly improving survival in a wide variety of patients who are immobile after stroke .. ABSTRACT  BACKGROUND We previously reported that integrating antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) with tuberculosis treatment reduces mortality . However , the timing for the initiation of ART during tuberculosis treatment remains unresolved . Findings in the earlier-ART group ( ART initiated within 4 weeks after the start of tuberculosis treatment ,  214 patients ) and later-ART group ( ART initiated during the first 4 weeks of the continuation phase of tuberculosis treatment ,  215 patients ) are presented here . RESULTS At baseline , the median CD4 + T-cell count was 150 per cubic millimeter , and the median viral load was 161,000 copies per milliliter , with no significant differences between the two groups . The incidence rates of the immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome ( IRIS ) were 20.1 and 7.7 cases per 100 person-years , respectively ( incidence-rate ratio , 2.62 ; 95 % CI , 1.48 to 4.82 ; P<0.001 ) . Adverse events requiring a switching of antiretroviral drugs occurred in 10 patients in the earlier-ART group and 1 patient in the later-ART group ( P=0.006 ) . CONCLUSIONS Early initiation of ART in patients with CD4 + T-cell counts of less than 50 per cubic millimeter increased AIDS-free survival .

ABSTRACT  BACKGROUND Early termination of prolonged seizures with intravenous administration of benzodiazepines improves outcomes . For faster and more reliable administration , paramedics increasingly use an intramuscular route . The primary outcome was absence of seizures at the time of arrival in the emergency department without the need for rescue therapy . Secondary outcomes included endotracheal intubation , recurrent seizures , and timing of treatment relative to the cessation of convulsive seizures . This trial tested the hypothesis that intramuscular midazolam was noninferior to intravenous lorazepam by a margin of 10 percentage points . Adverse-event rates were similar in the two groups . CONCLUSIONS For subjects in status epilepticus , intramuscular midazolam is at least as safe and effective as intravenous lorazepam for prehospital seizure cessation .

ABSTRACT  Interventions to reduce preterm birth in these women have not been successful . We assessed whether a cervical pessary could effectively prevent poor perinatal outcomes . Participants and investigators were aware of group allocation . For women in the pessary group , a midwife or obstetrician inserted a cervical pessary between 16 and 20 weeks ' gestation . Women in the control group did not receive the pessary , but otherwise received similar obstetrical care to those in the pessary group . Analyses were by modified intention to treat .

ABSTRACT  We assessed outcomes from the TRILOGY ACS trial based on whether or not patients had coronary angiography before treatment was chosen . METHODS TRILOGY ACS ( Clinical Trials.gov number NCT00699998 ) was a r and omised controlled trial , done at more than 800 sites worldwide . Patients with non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome who were selected for management without [ corrected ] revascularisation were r and omly assigned to clopidogrel or prasugrel . The primary endpoint was cardiovascular death , myocardial infa rct ion , or stroke at 30 months . In the present analysis we assessed differences in the primary endpoint by angiography status and whether the effects of treatment on the primary endpoint differed between patients who had angiography before enrolment and those who had not . FINDINGS 7243 patients younger than 75 years were included in the TRILOGY ACS primary analysis . 3085 ( 43 % ) had angiography at baseline , 4158 ( 57 % ) had not . Overall , TIMI major bleeding and GUSTO severe bleeding were rare . Bleeding outcomes tended to be higher with prasugrel but did not differ significantly between treatment groups in either angiography cohort . This result needs to be corroborated , but it is consistent with previous trials of more versus less intensive antiplatelet treatment . FUNDING Daiichi Sankyo , Eli Lilly. ABSTRACT  After the failure of torcetrapib it was unknown if HDL produced by interaction with CETP had pro-atherogenic or pro-inflammatory properties . R and omisation was done with a computer-generated r and omisation code and was stratified by centre . Patients and investigators were masked to treatment . Analysis was by intention to treat . This trial is registered at Clinical Trials.gov , NCT00655473 . Dalcetrapib did not increase office blood pressure and the frequency of adverse events was similar between groups . INTERPRETATION Dalcetrapib showed no evidence of a pathological effect related to the arterial wall over 24 months . FUNDING F Hoffmann-La Roche. ABSTRACT  We conducted a phase 3 study of the efficacy and safety of the combination versus gemcitabine monotherapy in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer . Patients received the study treatment until disease progression . The primary end point was overall survival ; secondary end points were progression-free survival and overall response rate . RESULTS A total of 861 patients were r and omly assigned to nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine ( 431 patients ) or gemcitabine  ( 430 ) . The survival rate was 35 % in the nab-paclitaxel-gemcitabine group versus 22 % in the gemcitabine group at 1 year , and 9 % versus 4 % at 2 years . Febrile neutropenia occurred in 3 % versus 1 % of the patients in the two groups . In the nab-paclitaxel-gemcitabine group , neuropathy of grade 3 or higher improved to grade 1 or lower in a median of 29 days . ( Funded by Celgene ; Clinical Trials.gov number , NCT00844649 . ). ABSTRACT  OBJECTIVES Gender and ethnicity are factors affecting the incidence and severity of vascular disease as well as subsequent treatment outcomes . This study describes the reporting of gender and ethnicity data in vascular surgery RCTs and analyzes whether these studies adequately represent our diverse patient population . Included studies were examined for gender and ethnicity data , study parameters , funding source , and geographic region . The Nationwide Inpatient Sample ( NIS ) data base was analyzed to obtain group-specific procedure frequency as an estimate of procedure frequency in the general population . RESULTS We review ed 77 studies , and 52 met our inclusion criteria . Only 85 % reported gender , and 21 % reported ethnicity . Reporting of ethnicity was strongly associated with larger ( > 280 participants ) , multicenter , government-funded trials ( P < .001 for all ) . CONCLUSIONS Minority ethnicity and female gender are under-reported and under-represented in vascular surgery RCTs , particularly in small , non-government-funded and single-center trials . The generalizability of some trial results may not be applicable to these population s. Greater effort to enroll a balanced study population in RCTs may yield more broadly applicable results. ABSTRACT  BACKGROUND Arthroscopic partial meniscectomy is one of the most common orthopedic procedures , yet rigorous evidence of its efficacy is lacking . Patients were r and omly assigned to arthroscopic partial meniscectomy or sham surgery . RESULTS In the intention-to-treat analysis , there were no significant between-group differences in the change from baseline to 12 months in any primary outcome . CONCLUSIONS In this trial involving patients without knee osteoarthritis but with symptoms of a degenerative medial meniscus tear , the outcomes after arthroscopic partial meniscectomy were no better than those after a sham surgical procedure .

ABSTRACT  BACKGROUND Bevacizumab has been suggested to have similar effectiveness to ranibizumab for treatment of neovascular age-related macular degeneration . Here , we report the findings at the prespecified 2-year timepoint . Study participants and clinical assessors were masked to drug allocation . Allocation to continuous or discontinuous treatment was masked up to 3 months , at which point investigators and participants were unmasked . The primary outcome was BCVA at 2 years , with a prespecified non-inferiority limit of 3\\u00b75 letters . The primary safety outcome was arterial thrombotic event or hospital admission for heart failure . Analyses were by modified intention to treat . This trial is registered , number IS RCT N92166560 . FINDINGS Between March 27 , 2008 , and Oct 15 , 2010 , 628 patients underwent r and omisation . 18 were withdrawn ; 610 received study drugs ( 314 ranibizumab ; 296 bevacizumab ) and were included in analyses . Discontinuous treatment was neither non-inferior nor inferior to continuous treatment ( -1\\u00b763 letters , -4\\u00b701 to 0\\u00b775 ; p=0\\u00b718 ) . INTERPRETATION Ranibizumab and bevacizumab have similar efficacy . Reduction in the frequency of retreatment result ed in a small loss of efficacy irrespective of drug . Safety was worse when treatment was administered discontinuously . These findings highlight that the choice of anti-VEGF treatment strategy is less straightforward than previously thought .

The overall rate of ascertainment of RAS status was 90 % . A total of 108 patients ( 17 % ) with nonmutated KRAS exon 2 had other RAS mutations . BRAF mutations were a negative prognostic factor . No new safety signals were identified . CONCLUSIONS Additional RAS mutations predicted a lack of response in patients who received panitumumab-FOLFOX4 . In patients who had metastatic colorectal cancer without RAS mutations , improvements in overall survival were observed with panitumumab-FOLFOX4 therapy . ( Funded by Amgen and others ; PRIME Clinical Trials.gov number , NCT00364013 . ). ABSTRACT  We investigated the effect of early multifactorial treatment after diagnosis by screening . The primary endpoint was first cardiovascular event , including cardiovascular mortality and morbidity , revascularisation , and non-traumatic amputation within 5 years . Patients and staff assessing outcomes were unaware of the practice 's study group assignment . Analysis was done by intention to treat . This study is registered with Clinical Trials.gov , number NCT00237549 . Findings Primary endpoint data were available for 3055 ( 99\\u00b79 % ) of 3057 screen-detected patients . The mean age was 60\\u00b73 ( SD 6\\u00b79 ) years and the mean duration of follow-up was 5\\u00b73 ( SD 1\\u00b76 ) years . Improvements in cardiovascular risk factors ( HbA1c and cholesterol concentrations and blood pressure ) were slightly but significantly better in the intensive treatment group .. ABSTRACT  The primary end point was length of stay in the hospital . Secondary end points included rates of discharge from the emergency department , major adverse cardiovascular events at 28 days , and cumulative costs . Safety end points were undetected acute coronary syndromes . RESULTS The rate of acute coronary syndromes  among 1000 patients with a mean ( \\u00b1SD ) age of 54\\u00b18 years ( 47 % women ) was 8 % . There were no undetected acute coronary syndromes and no significant differences in major adverse cardiovascular events at 28 days . After CCTA , there was more downstream testing and higher radiation exposure . The cumulative mean cost of care was similar in the CCTA group and the st and ard-evaluation group ( $ 4,289 and $ 4,060 , respectively ; P=0.65 ) .

ABSTRACT  BACKGROUND Catheter-associated urinary tract infection ( CAUTI ) is a major preventable cause of harm for patients in hospital . Patients undergoing unplanned catheterisation were also included and consent for participation was obtained retrospectively . Participants and trial staff were unmasked to treatment assignment . Data were collected by trial staff and by patient-reported question naires for 6 weeks after r and omisation . The primary outcome was incidence of symptomatic urinary tract infection for which an antibiotic was prescribed by 6 weeks . This study is registered , number IS RCT N75198618 . Rates of catheter-related discomfort were higher in the nitrofural group than they were in the other groups . INTERPRETATION Silver alloy-coated catheters were not effective for reduction of incidence of symptomatic CAUTI . The reduction we noted in CAUTI associated with nitrofural-impregnated catheters was less than that regarded as clinical ly important . Routine use of antimicrobial-impregnated catheters is not supported by this trial . FUNDING UK National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment Programme. ABSTRACT  BACKGROUND The higher prevalence and cost of depression for women compared with men and the possible gender differences in treatment response dem and the inclusion of women in clinical trials of depression treatments . The purpose of this study is to examine the inclusion of women and gender-specific analyses in recent r and omized clinical trials ( RCTs ) for depression . METHODS RCTs were identified through a MEDLINE search for trials published between January 1 and December 31 , 2007 , and a Clinical trials.gov search of self-identified interventional studies to treat depression . RESULTS Of the 150 RCTs for depression published in 2007 , 15 % did not report the gender composition of their sample , 50 % of studies did not analyze outcomes by gender , and 12 % controlled for gender but did not analyze for gender differences . Of the 768 trials review ed on Clinical trials.gov , 89 % reported recruiting male and female participants , yet < 1 % reported an intention to analyze results by gender . CONCLUSIONS Many recent studies of depression treatments include women but do not examine outcomes by gender . Underst and ing how women differ from men in response to treatment is critical for enhancing treatment efficacy for the greatest number of adults with depression. ABSTRACT  BACKGROUND In trachoma control programmes , azithromycin is distributed to treat the strains of chlamydia that cause ocular disease . We aim ed to compare the effect of annual versus twice-yearly distribution of azithromycin on infection with these strains . R and om assignment was done with the R AND OM and SORT functions of Microsoft Excel . All individuals were offered their assigned treatment of a single , directly observed , oral dose of azithromycin . Our analysis was by intention to treat . This study is registered with Clinical Trials.gov , number NCT00322972 . INTERPRETATION After 42 months of treatment , the prevalence of ocular infection with chlamydia was similar in the groups treated annually and twice yearly . However , elimination of infection might have been more rapid in the groups of villages that received treatment twice yearly . FUNDING National Institutes of Health ( NEI U10 EY016214 ). ABSTRACT  BACKGROUND Atherosclerotic renal-artery stenosis is a common problem in the elderly . Despite two r and omized trials that did not show a benefit of renal-artery stenting with respect to kidney function , the usefulness of stenting for the prevention of major adverse renal and cardiovascular events is uncertain . There were also no significant differences between the treatment groups in the rates of the individual components of the primary end point or in all-cause mortality . During follow-up , there was a consistent modest difference in systolic blood pressure favoring the stent group ( -2.3 mm Hg ; 95 % CI , -4.4 to -0.2 ; P=0.03 ) .

ABSTRACT  BACKGROUND Powders containing iron and other micronutrients are recommended as a strategy to prevent nutritional anaemia and other micronutrient deficiencies in children . We assessed the effects of provision of two micronutrient powder formulations , with or without zinc , to children in Pakistan . METHODS We did a cluster r and omised trial in urban and rural sites in Sindh , Pakistan . Children in the clusters aged 6 months were eligible for inclusion in the study . Powders were to be given daily between 6 and 18 months of age ; follow-up was to age 2 years . Parents knew whether their child was receiving supplementation , but did not know whether the powder contained zinc . Primary outcomes were growth , episodes of diarrhoea , acute lower respiratory tract infection , fever , and incidence of admission to hospital . This trial is registered with Clinical Trials.gov , number NCT00705445 . RESULTS The trial was done between Nov 1 , 2008 , and Dec 31 , 2011 . 947 children were enrolled in group A clusters , 910 in group B clusters , and 889 in group C clusters . Incidence of febrile episodes or admission to hospital for diarrhoea , respiratory problems , or febrile episodes did not differ between the three groups .

ABSTRACT  Patients ( age range , 16 to 80 years ) had tumor stage T1 to T3 , with possible spread to nearby lymph nodes but without metastasis . End points were the rate of success of ablation at 6 to 9 months , adverse events , quality of life , and length of hospital stay . RESULTS A total of 438 patients underwent r and omization ; data could be analyzed for 421 . All 95 % confidence intervals for the differences were within \\u00b110 percentage points , indicating noninferiority . Similar results were found for low-dose radioiodine plus thyrotropin alfa ( 84.3 % ) versus high-dose radioiodine plus thyroid hormone withdrawal ( 87.6 % ) or high-dose radioiodine plus thyrotropin alfa ( 90.2 % ) . More patients in the high-dose group than in the low-dose group were hospitalized for at least 3 days ( 36.3 % vs. 13.0 % , P<0.001 ) . CONCLUSIONS Low-dose radioiodine plus thyrotropin alfa was as effective as high-dose radioiodine , with a lower rate of adverse events .

ABSTRACT  Dolutegravir , in combination with abacavir-lamivudine , may provide a simplified regimen . The primary end point was the proportion of participants with an HIV-1 RNA level of less than 50 copies per milliliter at week 48 . Secondary end points included the time to viral suppression , the change from baseline in CD4 + T-cell count , safety , and viral resistance . RESULTS A total of 833 participants received at least one dose of study drug . No participants in the DTG-ABC-3TC group had detectable antiviral resistance ; one tenofovir DF-associated mutation and four efavirenz-associated mutations were detected in participants with virologic failure in the EFV-TDF-FTC group . CONCLUSIONS Dolutegravir plus abacavir-lamivudine had a better safety profile and was more effective through 48 weeks than the regimen with efavirenz-tenofovir DF-emtricitabine .

Studies where individuals were not the unit of analysis , those begun before 1994 , and those not receiving federal funding were excluded . PubMed search located 512 published articles . After exclusion of ineligible articles , 86 ( 17 % ) remained for analysis . RESULTS Thirty studies were sex specific . The  median enrollment of women in the 56 studies that included both men and women was 37 % . Seventy-five percent of the studies did not report any outcomes by sex , including 9 studies reporting < 20 % women enrolled . Only 3 studies indicated that the generalizability of their results may be limited by lack of diversity among those studied . There were no statistically significant changes in inclusion or reporting of sex or race/ethnicity when compared with 2004 .. ABSTRACT  BACKGROUND Maintenance therapy , often with azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil , is required to consoli date remission and prevent relapse after the initial control of lupus nephritis . The study group underwent repeat r and omization in a 1:1 ratio . Up to 10 mg of prednisone per day or its equivalent was permitted . Secondary assessment s included the time to the individual components of treatment failure and adverse events . RESULTS A total of 227 patients were r and omly assigned to maintenance treatment ( 116 to mycophenolate mofetil and 111 to azathioprine ) . Observed rates of treatment failure were 16.4 % ( 19 of 116 patients ) in the mycophenolate mofetil group and 32.4 % ( 36 of 111 ) in the azathioprine group . Adverse events , most commonly minor infections and gastrointestinal disorders , occurred in more than 95 % of the patients in both groups ( P = 0.68 ) . CONCLUSIONS Mycophenolate mofetil was superior to azathioprine in maintaining a renal response to treatment and in preventing relapse in patients with lupus nephritis who had a response to induction therapy .

ABSTRACT  In view of the few treatment options and the potential toxicity associated with lifelong ART , in the CHER trial we compared early time-limited ART with deferred ART . The r and omisation schedule was stratified by clinical site with permuted blocks of r and om sizes to balance the numbers of infants allocated to each group . Combination therapy of lopinavir-ritonavir , zidovudine , and lamivudine was the first-line treatment regimen at ART initiation and re-initiation . The primary endpoint was time to failure of first-line ART ( immunological , clinical , or virological ) or death . Comparisons were done by intention-to-treat analysis , with use of time-to-event methods . This trial is registered with Clinical Trials.gov , number NCT00102960 . Median follow-up was 4\\u00b78 years ; 34 infants ( 9 % ) were lost to follow-up . Median time to ART initiation in the ART-Def group was 20 weeks ( IQR 16 - 25 ) . Proportions of follow-up time spent on ART were 81 % in the ART-Def group , 70 % in the ART-40W group , and 69 % in the ART-96W group . Three children in ART-Def , three in ART-40W , and one in ART-96W switched to second-line ART . Longer time on primary ART permits longer subsequent interruption , with marginally better outcomes .

We investigated whether combination therapy with glucocorticoids plus N-acetylcysteine would improve survival . METHODS We r and omly assigned 174 patients to receive prednisolone plus N-acetylcysteine ( 85 patients ) or only prednisolone ( 89 patients ) . All patients received 4 weeks of prednisolone . The prednisolone-only group received an infusion in 1000 ml of 5 % glucose solution per day on days 1 through 5 . The primary outcome was 6-month survival . RESULTS Mortality was not significantly lower in the prednisolone-N-acetylcysteine group than in the prednisolone-only group at 6 months ( 27 % vs. 38 % , P = 0.07 ) . Mortality was significantly lower at 1 month ( 8 % vs. 24 % , P = 0.006 ) but not at 3 months ( 22 % vs. 34 % , P = 0.06 ) . Infections were less frequent in the prednisolone-N-acetylcysteine group than in the prednisolone-only group ( P = 0.001 ) ; other side effects were similar in the two groups .

ABSTRACT  BACKGROUND Most patients who have had a stroke are dependent on informal caregivers for activities of daily living . METHODS We undertook a pragmatic , multicentre , cluster r and omised controlled trial with a parallel cost-effectiveness analysis . Patients with a diagnosis of stroke , likely to return home with residual disability and with a caregiver providing support were eligible . The primary outcome for caregivers was self-reported burden at 6 months , measured with the caregivers burden scale ( CBS ) . We combined patient and caregiver costs with primary outcomes and quality -adjusted life-years ( QALYs ) to assess cost-effectiveness . This trial is registered with controlled-trials.com , number IS RCT N 49208824 . FINDINGS We assessed 49 stroke units for eligibility , of which 36 were r and omly assigned to either the intervention group or the control group . Probabilities of cost-effectiveness based on QALYs were low . INTERPRETATION In a large scale , robust evaluation , results from this study have shown no differences between the LSCTC and usual care on any of the assessed outcomes . The immediate period after stroke might not be the ideal time to deliver structured caregiver training . FUNDING Medical Research Council. ABSTRACT  Differential enrollment into clinical trials by gender has been described previously . In 1993 , the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) Revitalization Act was enacted to promote the inclusion of women in clinical trials . A systematic search was conducted of all articles published in the Original Articles section of The New Engl and Journal of Medicine from 1994 to 1999 . On average , 24.6 % women were enrolled . Gender-specific data analysis was performed in 14 % of the trials .. ABSTRACT  The primary composite end point was the time until death from cardiovascular causes or major thrombotic events . The secondary end points were cardiovascular events , cardiovascular hospitalizations , incidence of cancer , progression to myelofibrosis , myelodysplasia or leukemic transformation , and hemorrhage . An intention-to-treat analysis was performed . There was no significant between-group difference in the rate of adverse events .

ABSTRACT  Pilot studies of treatment with arsenic trioxide with or without ATRA have shown high efficacy and reduced hematologic toxicity . The study was design ed as a noninferiority trial to show that the difference between the rates of event-free survival at 2 years in the two groups was not greater than 5 % . The median follow-up was 34.4 months . Overall survival was also better with ATRA-arsenic trioxide ( P=0.02 ) . As compared with ATRA-chemotherapy , ATRA-arsenic trioxide was associated with less hematologic toxicity and fewer infections but with more hepatic toxicity . CONCLUSIONS ATRA plus arsenic trioxide is at least not inferior and may be superior to ATRA plus chemotherapy in the treatment of patients with low-to-intermediate-risk APL .

ABSTRACT  BACKGROUND Among patients with Alzheimer 's disease who have had a response to antipsychotic medication for psychosis or agitation-aggression , the risk of a recurrence of symptoms after discontinuation of the medication has not been established . METHODS Patients with Alzheimer 's disease and psychosis or agitation-aggression received open-label treatment with risperidone for 16 weeks . The primary outcome was the time to relapse of psychosis or agitation . RESULTS A total of 180 patients received open-label  risperidone ( mean dose , 0.97 mg daily ) . The severity of psychosis and agitation were reduced , although there was a mild increase in extrapyramidal signs ;  112 patients met the criteria for response to treatment , of whom 110 underwent r and omization . CONCLUSIONS In patients with Alzheimer 's disease who had psychosis or agitation that had responded to risperidone therapy for 4 to 8 months , discontinuation of risperidone was associated with an increased risk of relapse . ( Funded by the National Institutes of Health and others ; Clinical Trials.gov number , NCT00417482 . ). ABSTRACT  Semagacestat is a small-molecule \\u03b3-secretase inhibitor that was developed as a potential treatment for Alzheimer 's disease . A mixed-model repeated- measures analysis was used . RESULTS The trial was terminated before completion on the basis of a recommendation by the data and safety monitoring board . At termination , there were 189 patients in the group receiving placebo  , 153 patients in the group receiving 100 mg of semagacestat , and 121 patients in the group receiving 140 mg of semagacestat . CONCLUSIONS As compared with placebo , semagacestat did not improve cognitive status , and patients receiving the higher dose had significant worsening of functional ability . Semagacestat was associated with more adverse events , including skin cancers and infections . ( Funded by Eli Lilly ; Clinical Trials.gov number , NCT00594568 .. ABSTRACT  BACKGROUND Interferon-free regimens would be a major advance in the treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) infection . The primary end point was a sustained virologic response 12 weeks after the completion of therapy . The sustained virologic response 12 weeks after the completion of therapy did not differ significantly according to treatment duration or dosage among ribavirin-containing regimens . This response was significantly higher with TID28W than with TID28W-NR ( P=0.03 ) . Rash , photosensitivity , nausea , vomiting , and diarrhea were the most common adverse events .

ABSTRACT  BACKGROUND The treatment of relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) has result ed in few durable remissions . Bruton 's tyrosine kinase ( BTK ) , an essential component of B-cell-receptor signaling , mediates interactions with the tumor microenvironment and promotes the survival and proliferation of CLL cells . A total of 85 patients , the majority of whom were considered to have high-risk disease , received ibrutinib orally once daily ; 51 received 420 mg , and 34 received 840 mg . The response was independent of clinical and genomic risk factors present before treatment , including advanced-stage disease , the number of previous therapies , and the 17p13.1 deletion . At 26 months , the estimated progression-free survival rate was 75 % and the rate of overall survival was 83 % . CONCLUSIONS Ibrutinib was associated with a high frequency of durable remissions in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL and small lymphocytic lymphoma , including patients with high-risk genetic lesions . ( Funded by Pharmacyclics and others ; Clinical Trials.gov number , NCT01105247 . ). ABSTRACT  BACKGROUND For patients with smoldering multiple myeloma , the st and ard of care is observation until symptoms develop . However , this approach does not identify high-risk patients who may benefit from early intervention . The primary end point was time to progression to symptomatic disease . Secondary end points were response rate , overall survival , and safety . A partial response or better was achieved in 79 % of patients in the treatment group after the induction phase and in 90 % during the maintenance phase . Toxic effects were mainly grade 2 or lower . CONCLUSIONS Early treatment for patients with high-risk smoldering myeloma delays progression to active disease and increases overall survival . ( Funded by Celgene ; Clinical Trials.gov number , NCT00480363 . ). ABSTRACT  We assessed cardiovascular outcomes with alogliptin , a new inhibitor of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 ( DPP-4 ) , as compared with placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes who had had a recent acute coronary syndrome . RESULTS A total of 5380 patients underwent r and omization and were followed for up to 40 months ( median , 18 months ) . Glycated hemoglobin levels were significantly lower with alogliptin than with placebo ( mean difference , -0.36 percentage points ; P<0.001 ) . Incidences of hypoglycemia , cancer , pancreatitis , and initiation of dialysis were similar with alogliptin and placebo .

ABSTRACT  BACKGROUND Although P2Y12 antagonists are effective in patients with non-ST-segment elevation ( NSTE ) acute coronary syndromes , the effect of the timing of administration -- before or after coronary angiography -- is not known . We evaluated the effect of administering the P2Y12 antagonist prasugrel at the time of diagnosis versus administering it after the coronary angiography if percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) was indicated . Patients were r and omly assigned to receive prasugrel ( a 30-mg loading dose ) before the angiography ( pretreatment group ) or placebo ( control group ) . When PCI was indicated , an additional 30 mg of prasugrel was given in the pretreatment group at the time of PCI and 60 mg of prasugrel was given in the control group . The rates of TIMI major bleeding and life-threatening bleeding not related to CABG were increased by a factor of 3 and 6 , respectively . Pretreatment did not reduce the rate of the primary outcome among patients undergoing PCI ( 69 % of the patients ) but increased the rate of TIMI major bleeding at 7 days . All the results were confirmed at 30 days and in prespecified subgroups . ( Funded by Daiichi Sankyo and Eli Lilly ; ACCOAST Clinical Trials.gov number , NCT01015287 . ). ABSTRACT  BACKGROUND Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ( IPF ) is a progressive , fatal disorder of unknown cause with no effective treatment . Cough affects up to 80 % of patients with IPF , is frequently disabling , and lacks effective therapy . OBJECTIVE To determine the efficacy of thalidomide in suppressing cough in patients with IPF . DESIGN 24-week , double-blind , 2-treatment , 2-period crossover trial . ( Clinical Trials.gov registration number : NCT00600028 ) SETTING 1 university center . MEASUREMENTS The primary end point was cough-specific quality of life measured by the Cough Quality of Life Question naire ( CQLQ ) . For all measures , lower scores equaled improved cough or respiratory quality of life . LIMITATION This was a single-center study of short duration and small sample size focused on symptom-specific quality of life . CONCLUSION Thalidomide improved cough and respiratory quality of life in patients with IPF . A larger trial is warranted to assess these promising results .

OBJECTIVE To compare extended prophylaxis with aspirin and dalteparin for prevention of symptomatic venous thromboembolism ( VTE )  after THA . R and omization was electronically generated ; patients were assigned to a treatment group through a Web-based program . ( Current Controlled Trials : IS RCT N11902170 ) . SETTING 12 tertiary care orthopedic referral centers in Canada . PATIENTS 778 patients who had elective unilateral THA between 2007 and 2010 . MEASUREMENTS Symptomatic VTE confirmed by objective testing ( primary efficacy outcome ) and bleeding . Aspirin was noninferior ( P < 0.001 ) but not superior ( P = 0.22 ) to dalteparin . LIMITATION The study was halted prematurely because of difficulty with patient recruitment . Given its low cost and greater convenience , aspirin may be considered a reasonable alternative for extended thromboprophylaxis after THA .

DESIGN R and omized , controlled trial with concealed allocation . ( Clinical Trials.gov : NCT01701206 ) . SETTING Online . After participants accepted a request to join the group , participation was voluntary . Group participation and engagement were monitored . Retention at study follow-up was more than 93 % . LIMITATION Only 2 Facebook communities were included for each group .\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether the introduction of ERAS care improved the adverse events in colorectal surgery . In a cohort study , mortality , morbidity , and length of stay were compared between ERAS patients and carefully matched historical controls . The primary outcome measures of this study were mortality and morbidity . Secondary outcome measures were fluid intake , length of hospital stay , the number of relaparotomies , and the number of readmissions within 30 days . Data on the ERAS patients were collected prospect ively . Results Sixty-one patients treated according to the ERAS program were compared with 122 patients who received conventional postoperative care . Morbidity was lower in the ERAS group compared to the control group ( 14.8 % versus 33.6 % respectively ; P = < 0.01 ) . There was no difference between the ERAS and the control group for mortality ( 0 % vs. 1.6 % ; P = 0.55 ) and readmission rate ( 3.3 % vs. 1.6 % ; P = 0.60 ) . Conclusion Enhanced Recovery After Surgery program  reduces morbidity and the length of hospital stay for patients undergoing elective colonic or rectal surgery. ABSTRACT  BACKGROUND Studies have shown the value of using fast-track postoperative recovery . St and ard procedures ( non-fast-track strategies ) remain in common use for perioperative care . Few prospect i ve reports exist on the outcome of fast-tracking in Central Europe . A design ed protocol was used in the FT group with the emphasis on an interdisciplinary approach . The control group ( non-FT ) was treated by st and ard established procedures . Postoperative pain , rehabilitation , gastrointestinal functions , postoperative complications , and post-op length of stay were recorded . RESULTS Of 105 patients , 103 were statistically analyzed . Patients in the FT group ( n=51 ) and non-FT group ( n=52 ) did not differ in age , surgical diagnosis , or procedure . Food tolerance was significantly better in the FT group and rehabilitation was also faster . There were no deaths and no patients were readmitted within 30 days . CONCLUSIONS Following the FT protocol helped to reduce frequency of postoperative complications and reduced hospital stay . We conclude that the FT strategy is safe and effective in improving postoperative outcomes. ABSTRACT  The aim of this trial was to compare  multimodal optimization  with  conventional perioperative management  in a consecutive series of patients undergoing a wide range of colorectal procedures. ABSTRACT  Background : To evaluate the feasibility of a fast-track ( FT ) program and it \\u2019s effect on postoperative recovery . Methods : All patients , scheduled for elective segmental colorectal resection were treated in a FT program ( FT group ) . Data were compared to a control group operated for elective colorectal resections and treated in a traditional care program ( TC group ) . Data from the FT group were collected prospect ively , data from the TC group retrospectively . Results : One-hundred and seven patients were included ( 55 FT group vs. 52 TC group ) . The groups were comparable for patient characteristics such as age and cr-POSSUM score ( p = 0.22 and p = 0.40 ) . An average of 7.4 of 13 predefined FT modalities were successfully achieved per patient . Patient satisfaction was comparable ( p = 0.84 ) . Seven versus 5 patients required a re-operation in the FT and TC groups , respectively ( p = 0.52 ) . Morbidity rate was comparable ( n = 16 vs. 15 , p = 0.83 ) . Six vs. 3 patients were re-admitted in the FT and TC groups , respectively ( p = 0.49 ) . Conclusion : Implementation of all FT modalities was difficult since a rather low number of pre-defined FT modalities was effectively realized . Despite incomplete implementation , PHS and THS were shorter in the FT group without affecting patient satisfaction. ABSTRACT  Multimodal optimization of surgical care has been associated with reduced hospital stay and improved physical function . The aim of this r and omized trial was to compare multimodal optimization with st and ard care in patients undergoing colonic resection. ABSTRACT  Outcome measures included pulmonary function , duration of postoperative ileus , pain perception , fatigue , morbidity , and mortality . Demographic and operative data were similar for the two groups . On the 1st postoperative day , pulmonary function was improved ( p = 0.01 ) in fast-track patients . Oral feeding was achieved earlier ( p < 0.01 ) and defecation occurred earlier ( p < 0.01 ) in the fast-track group . Morbidity was not different for the two groups . Fast-track patients were discharged on day 4 ( range , 3\\u20136 ) and st and ard-care patients on day 7 ( range , 4\\u201314 ) ( p < 0.001 ) . Conclusion Multimodal rehabiliation can improve further on the excellent results of laparoscopic sigmoidectomy and decrease the postoperative hospital stay. ABSTRACT  OBJECTIVE To investigate the feasibility of a 48-hour postoperative stay program after colonic resection . Limiting factors for early recovery include stress-induced organ dysfunction , paralytic ileus , pain , and fatigue . Postoperative follow-up was scheduled at 8 and 30 days . RESULTS Median age was 74 years , with 20 patients in ASA group III-IV . There were no cardiopulmonary complications . Such a program may also reduce postoperative ileus and cardiopulmonary complications .. ABSTRACT  Although several protocol s have been reported to reduce postoperative stay , no Level I evidence exists for their use in routine clinical practice . Subgroups were defined to evaluate those who derived the optimal benefit from the protocol . Patients younger than 70 years old had greater benefits than the overall study group ( 5 vs. 7.1 days ; P = 0.01 ) . Patients treated by surgeons with the most experience with the pathway spent significantly less time in the hospital than did those whose surgeons were less experienced with the pathway ( P = 0.01 ) . There was no difference between pathway and traditional patients for readmission or complication rates , pain score , quality of life after surgery , or overall satisfaction with the hospital stay . CONCLUSIONS : Patients scheduled for a laparotomy and major intestinal or rectal resection  are suitable for management by a pathway of controlled rehabilitation with early ambulation and diet . Pathway patients have a shorter hospital stay , with no adverse effect on patient satisfaction , pain scores , or complication rates . Patients younger than 70 years of age derive the optimal benefit , and increased surgeon experience improves outcome. ABSTRACT  Adherence to both regimens was reinforced using a daily checklist and protocol guidance sheets . Discharge decision was made using preagreed criteria . The primary endpoint was postoperative stay , and achievement of independence milestones . Secondary endpoints were postoperative complications , readmission rates , and mortality . Analysis was by intention to treat . Results : Seventy patients were recruited . Approximately one fourth underwent TME . Median ages were similar ( 69.3 vs. 73.0 years ) . Patients in the multimodal group had less cardiorespiratory and anastomotic complications but more readmissions . There were 2 deaths , both controls . Morbidity and mortality are not increased. ABSTRACT  Emergency operations were not included . All patients were treated with intravenous and oral antibiotics prior to surgery . The patients in the MBP group received Soffodex for bowel preparation . RESULTS A total of 329 patients participated in the study , 165 without MBP and 164 with MBP . The 2 groups were similar in age , sex , and type of surgical procedure . However , this difference was not statistically significant . CONCLUSION Our results suggest that no advantage is gained by preoperative MBP in elective colorectal surgery. ABSTRACT  Recent studies have suggested that MBP does not lower the risk of postoperative septic complications after elective colorectal surgery . This r and omized clinical trial assessed whether preoperative MBP is beneficial in elective colonic surgery. ABSTRACT  This study was design ed to investigate the physiologic effects of bowel preparation . Fluid and food intake were st and ardized according to weight , providing adequate calorie and oral fluid intake . No differences in plasma or extracellular volumes were seen . Orthostatic tolerance and balance function did not change after bowel preparation . CONCLUSIONS : Bowel preparation has significant adverse physiologic effects , which may be attributed to dehydration .. ABSTRACT  Postoperative organ dysfunction contributes to morbidity , hospital stay and convalescence .\",\n          \" Inguinal hernias in women are relatively rare , and an outcome in this specific subgroup of hernias has not been documented in the literature . The reoperation rate was independent of the type of surgical repair . In 41.5 % of the reoperations a femoral hernia was found , compared to 5.4 % in males . Female inguinal herniorrhaphy is followed by a higher reoperation rate than in males , and is unrelated to the type of repair . The frequent finding of a femoral hernia at reoperation suggests the need for the exploration of the femoral canal at the primary operation. ABSTRACT  The European Hernia Society ( EHS ) is proud to present the EHS Guidelines for the Treatment of  Inguinal Hernia in Adult Patients . The Guidelines contain recommendations for the treatment of inguinal hernia from diagnosis till aftercare . They have been developed by a Working Group consisting of expert surgeons with representatives of 14 country members of the EHS . They are evidence -based and , when necessary , a consensus was reached among all members . The Guidelines have been review ed by a Steering Committee . Before finalisation , feedback from different national hernia societies was obtained . The  Appraisal of Guidelines for REsearch and Evaluation ( AGREE ) instrument was used by the Cochrane Association to vali date the Guidelines . The Guidelines can be used to adjust local protocol s , for training purpose s and quality control . Developing guidelines leads to questions that remain to be answered by specific research . In addition , a short summary , specifically for the general practitioner , is given . The most important challenge now will be the implementation of the Guidelines in daily surgical practice . This remains an important task for the EHS . Working together on this project was a great learning experience , and it was worthwhile and fun .. ABSTRACT  BACKGROUND An association between smoking and impaired wound healing has been reported in retrospective studies . The smoking status of a surgical patient may be confounded by social and medical parameters . We have evaluated the effect of smoking in a test wound in volunteers , with special reference to a reliable scientific match between smokers and nonsmokers . RESULTS The nonsmokers had a 1.8 times higher median amount of hydroxyproline than the smokers ( p < 0.01 ) . The impairment was specific for the production of collagenous proteins and not other proteins . CONCLUSIONS The synthesis of subcutaneous collagen in smokers is specifically impeded , indicating an impaired wound-healing process .. ABSTRACT  Background Large-scale data for the optimal inguinal hernia repair in younger men with an indirect hernia is not available . We analysed nationwide data for risk of reoperation in younger men after a primary repair using a Lichtenstein operation or a conventional non-mesh hernia repair . We included only men between the age of 18 and 30 years with a primary repair of a primary indirect inguinal hernia . The observation time after  conventional hernia repair  was median 62 months ( range 0\\u201396 ) and 41 months ( range 0\\u201396 ) after a Lichtenstein repair . Conclusions Lichtenstein repair for an indirect inguinal hernia reduces the risk of recurrence in young men between the age of 18 and 30 years compared with a sutured repair . The use of a Lichtenstein mesh repair in young males must be balanced against the risk of chronic pain. ABSTRACT  The present study evaluated TAPP based on prospect i ve documentation. ABSTRACT  BACKGROUND We sought to determine perioperative variables predictive of complications or recurrence for patients undergoing surgical repair of inguinal hernias . RESULTS Recurrent and scrotal hernias were predictors for short term and overall complications , regardless of technique . Long-term pain complaints decreased as patient age increased in both groups . Patient and surgeon factors were predictive of recurrence but varied greatly depending on surgical technique . CONCLUSIONS Regardless of technique , scrotal and recurrent hernias were associated with a greater risk of complications and younger patients had more long-term pain . Predictors of recurrence vary based on surgical technique. ABSTRACT  Cigarette smokers deposit less collagen , expressed as hydroxyproline , in granulation tissue than nonsmokers . We studied the effect of abstinence from smoking and transdermal nicotine patches on deposition of hydroxyproline , proline , type I procollagen , and total proteins . Fifty-four healthy smokers were studied during 10 days of smoking and again from days 10 to 20 following smoking cessation . During this period and during smoking , an exp and ed polytetrafluoroethylene tube was implanted into the subcutis . Following removal of the implant , total amino acids and peptides were extracted . We conclude that 20 days of abstinence from smoking does not affect collagen deposition in granulation tissue . However , in abstinent smokers , transdermal nicotine patches appears to increase type I collagen synthesis. ABSTRACT  OBJECTIVE To establish a register of  inguinal hernia surgery  that allows audit and analyses of data from several centres . DESIGN Prospect i ve recording of data on a common protocol . SETTING Eight Swedish hospitals . RESULTS During the three years studied 4879 hernia operations were undertaken in 4474 patients . Of all herniorrhaphies 798 ( 16 % ) were done for recurrences , 142 of these after operations between 1992 and 1994 .. ABSTRACT  Objective :  Inguinal  hernias are very common disorders , especially in men , with inguinal herniorrhaphy being one of the most frequently performed general surgical procedures in men . Theoretically , obesity might increase the risk of groin hernia by increasing intra-abdominal pressure . Main Outcome Measures : A diagnosis of groin hernia according to the Swedish hospital discharge register . Results : A total of 1017 men ( 13.6 % ) were diagnosed with groin hernia . An inverse relationship was found between body mass index ( BMI ) and risk of groin hernia . With each BMI unit ( 3\\u20134 kg ) , the relative risk for groin hernia decreased by 4 % ( P < 0.0001 ) . Compared with men of normal weight , obese men had a 43 % lower risk ( P = 0.0008 , 95 % confidence interval 21%\\u201359 % ) . Heavy smokers demonstrated a 26 % lower risk for groin hernia ( P = 0.003 , 95 % confidence interval 10%\\u201339 % ) . Diabetes , high physical activity , and blood pressure were not associated with groin hernia . Obesity , in comparison with normal weight , reduced the risk of groin hernia by 43 % . A reduced risk of groin hernia was also noted in heavy smokers . Obviously , hernia may be more easily detected in lean men but a true protective effect can not be excluded. ABSTRACT  During surgery , both inguinal and femoral canal orifices were routinely inspected . The presence of unilateral or bilateral inguinal and femoral hernias was recorded and repaired accordingly . Results There were a total of 362 patients . More males ( 343 , 95 % ) underwent a TEP hernia repair than females ( 19 , 5 % ) . There were more cases of unilateral ( 240/362 , 66 % ) than bilateral ( 122/362 , 34 % ) inguinal hernias . A total of 18 cases of synchronous femoral hernias were found during operation . None of the femoral hernias were clinical ly detectable preoperatively . Conclusion Females undergoing elective inguinal hernia repair are more likely to have a synchronous femoral hernia than males . We suggest that all women presenting with an inguinal hernia also have a formal assessment of the femoral canal .. ABSTRACT  Methods Data were retrieved for all groin hernia repairs prospect ively recorded in the Swedish Hernia register from 1996 to 1998 . Actuarial analysis adjusted for patients \\u2019 death was used for calculating the cumulative incidence of reoperation . Relative risk for reoperation was estimated using the Cox proportional hazards model . At 24 months the risk for having had a reoperation was 4.6 % after recurrent hernia repair and 1.7 % after primary hernia repair . The relative risk for reoperation was significantly lower for laparoscopic methods and for anterior tension-free repair than for other techniques . Postoperative complications and direct hernia were associated with an increased relative risk for reoperation . Day-case surgery and local infiltration anesthesia were used less frequently for recurrent hernia than for primary hernia . Conclusions Recurrent groin hernia still constitutes a significant quantitative problem for the surgical community . This study supports the use of mesh by laparoscopy or anterior tension-free repair for recurrent hernia operations. ABSTRACT  OBJECTIVE To find out whether simultaneous repair of bilateral hernias increases the risk of recurrence compared with unilateral repair . DESIGN Prospect i ve study . SETTING Swedish hospitals participating in the Swedish Hernia Register ( SHR ) . INTERVENTIONS Prospect i ve collection of data from the SHR , 1992 - 1999 inclusive . The Cox proportional hazard test was used for calculating odds ratio ( OR ) . RESULTS 33416 unilateral and 1487 bilateral operations on 2974 groin hernias were found . The OR for reoperation after laparoscopic bilateral repair compared with open bilateral repair was 0.9 ( 95 % CI 0.6 to 1.4 ) .. ABSTRACT  RESULTS In our study , 5524 consecutive patients underwent 6860 laparoscopic hernia repairs . ( 19/1336 ) . Bilateral inguinal hernia is an ideal indication for endoscopic transabdominal repair. ABSTRACT  OBJECTIVES To examine the relationship between operating time and reoperation for recurrence and other complications in groin hernia repairs . DESIGN Observational population -based register study . SETTING Data from the nationwide Swedish Hernia Register , which prospect ively collects data from almost all groin hernia repairs performed in Sweden . PATIENTS There were 123,917 primary groin hernia repairs recorded in the Swedish Hernia Register from January 1 , 1998 , through December 31 , 2007 . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Relative risk of reoperation for recurrence and odds ratios for postoperative complications in 4 operating time groups . Because the Lichtenstein procedure is the st and ard procedure in Sweden today , its results were also analyzed separately . In this homogeneous group , the difference was even more striking with an increased relative risk of 45 % ( 1.45 ; 95 % CI , 1.21 - 1.75 ) . The odds ratio for infection and other postoperative complications increased with increasing operating time .. ABSTRACT  Objective : To describe the characteristics of patients undergoing multiple groin hernia repairs  and to identify strategies that prevent further recurrence . Low numbers and heterogeneity have made it difficult to perform large prospect i ve studies on this group . Methods : The study was design ed as an observational population -based register study . All repairs for recurrent hernia recorded in the Swedish Hernia Register ( SHR ) 1992\\u20132006 were identified . The risk for further reoperation increased with the number of previous repairs ( P < 0.001 ) . The difference between Lichtenstein repair and laparoscopic repair was significant for the first 2 repairs ( P < 0.05 ) . Conclusion : Laparoscopic preperitoneal repair provides the best surgical outcome in repeated groin hernia recurrence. ABSTRACT  Objectives : We examined the influence of surgeon age and other factors on proficiency in laparoscopic or open hernia repair . We have also reported significant differences in RR for the open procedure related to resident postgraduate year ( PGY ) level . Methods : We analyzed data from unilateral laparoscopic and open herniorrhaphies from CSP 456 ( n = 1629 ) . Results : Age was dichotomized into older ( \\u226545 years ) and younger ( < 45 years ) . Surgeon 's inexperience and older age were significant predictors of recurrence in laparoscopic herniorrhaphy . The odds of recurrence for an inexperienced surgeon aged 45 years or older was 1.72 times that of a younger inexperienced surgeon . For open repairs , only a median PGY level of <3 was a significant risk factor. ABSTRACT  OBJECTIVE Analysis of reoperation and recurrence rates three years after repair of groin hernias . DESIGN Prospect i ve audit by question naire and selective follow-up . SETTING Eight Swedish hospitals . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Postoperative complications , reoperation for recurrence , and recurrence . RESULTS During 1992 , 1565 hernia operations were done . The postoperative complication rate was 8 % ( 125/1565 ) . The interhospital variation in recurrence rate ranged from 3 % to 20 % .. ABSTRACT  05 ) of 1562ng mL(-1 ) against the CG 684ng mL(-1 ) . 5ng mL(-1 ) of the CG ( statistical significance of P<0 ( . ) 05 ) . DISCUSSION The MMP-2 and TIMP-2 levels were concurrently elevated only in the recurrent hernia group .\",\n          \" BACKGROUND Heart failure treatment guidelines emphasize daily weight monitoring for patients with heart failure , but data to support this practice are lacking . METHODS This was a r and omized , controlled trial . The primary end point was 6-month hospital readmission rate . Mean age was 59 + /- 15 years and 68 % were male . No differences in hospitalization rates were observed . There was a 56.2 % reduction in mortality ( P < .003 ) for patients r and omized to the AlereNet group .. ABSTRACT  We hypothesized that early intervention could prevent hospitalizations and affect outcome . All devices featured a monitoring tool to track changes in intrathoracic impedance ( OptiVol ) and other diagnostic parameters . The primary end point was a composite of all-cause mortality and heart failure hospitalizations . Clinical Trial Registration \\u2014 URL : http://www . clinical trials.gov . Unique identifier : NCT 00480077. ABSTRACT  Clinical HF status and device data were assessed at enrolment , during regular follow-up , and if patients presented with an alert or HF deterioration . Data from 373 subjects were analysed . Higher NYHA class at baseline was predictive for adequate alert events during follow-up ( P < 0.05 ) . In 11 of 20 HF deteriorations without preceding alert , an upstroke of the fluid index occurred without reaching the programmed alert threshold . CONCLUSION A device-based algorithm that alerts patients in case of decreasing intrathoracic impedance facilitates the detection of HF deterioration .. ABSTRACT  Conventional approaches to the early detection of pulmonary and systemic congestion have been shown to be of limited sensitivity . While once thought to hold great promise , results from recent prospect i ve studies on telemonitoring strategies have proven disappointing . Conventional electrophysiologic parameters and intrathoracic impedance data are currently available in the growing population of heart failure patients with equipped devices . A variety of implantable hemodynamic monitors are currently under investigation . How best to integrate these devices into a systematic approach to the management of patients before , during , and after AHFS  is yet to be established. ABSTRACT  BACKGROUND Heart failure is associated with a high rate of hospitalization and poor prognosis . Telemonitoring could help implement and maintain effective therapy and detect worsening heart failure and its cause promptly to prevent medical crises . HTM consisted of twice-daily patient self-measurement of weight , blood pressure , heart rate , and rhythm with automated devices linked to a cardiology center . The NTS consisted of specialist nurses who were available to patients by telephone . Primary care physicians delivered UC . The primary end point was days dead or hospitalized with NTS versus HTM at 240 days . During 240 days of follow-up , 19.5 % , 15.9 % , and 12.7 % of days were lost as the result of death or hospitalization for UC , NTS , and HTM , respectively ( no significant difference ) . CONCLUSIONS Further investigation and refinement of the application of HTM are warranted because it may be a valuable role for the management of selected patients with heart failure. ABSTRACT  METHODS AND RESULTS A total of 188 consented and eligible patients were r and omized between intervention and control groups in 1:1 ratio . Subjects r and omized to the intervention arm received the SPAN-CHF disease management program in conjunction with the AHM system . The primary end point was prespecified as the relative event rate of HF hospitalization between intervention and control groups at 90 days . The relative event rate of HF hospitalization for the intervention group compared with controls was 0.50 ( 95%CI [ 0.25 - 0.99 ] , P = .05 ) . CONCLUSIONS Short-term reductions in the heart failure hospitalization rate were associated with the use of automated home monitoring equipment . Long-term benefits in this model remain to be studied. ABSTRACT  BACKGROUND Heart failure is a common and important cause of morbidity and mortality . Nurses also screened patients for heart failure exacerbations , which they managed with supplemental diuretics or by contacting the primary physician for instructions . Outcomes included time to hospital encounter , mortality , number and cost of hospitalizations , functional status , and satisfaction with care . The number of admissions , hospital days , and hospital costs were significantly lower during the first 6 months after intervention but not at 1 year . The intervention had little effect on functional status , mortality , and satisfaction with care . CONCLUSION A nurse-administered , telephone-based disease management program delayed subsequent health care encounters , but had minimal impact on other outcomes. ABSTRACT  The primary end point was death from any cause or a nonfatal heart-failure event ( whichever came first ) . Heart-failure events were diagnosed by physicians who were aware of the treatment assignments , but they were adjudicated by a committee that was unaware of assignments . The benefit did not differ significantly between patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy and those with nonischemic cardiomyopathy . CRT was associated with a significant reduction in left ventricular volumes and improvement in the ejection fraction . There was no significant difference between the two groups in the overall risk of death , with a 3 % annual mortality rate in each treatment group . Serious adverse events were infrequent in the two groups . ( Clinical Trials.gov number , NCT00180271 .. ABSTRACT  Methods Patients implanted with CRT-D for more than 6 months received the CareLink monitor and were trained to perform device interrogation . At-home transmissions were scheduled at 2 weeks , 1 and 2 months after training , with a final in-office visit after 3 months . Results Sixty-seven patients performed 264 data transmissions . Twenty-three unscheduled data transmissions were requested by the centers after patient contact . Of these events , in two cases ( 15 % ) in-hospital visits were requested , while in 11 ( 85 % ) no action was needed and no additional in-clinic visits were scheduled . During the study period , in 20/28 ( 71 % ) intra-thoracic impedance alerts , the patients remotely transmitted their device data . In six episodes an in-hospital extra visit was scheduled . On the whole , in 14 cases ( 70 % ) , the patient could be managed remotely avoiding a visit to the hospital . Conclusions Our study showed that remote follow-up is an efficient method to manage tachyarrhythmias and heart failure episodes in  CRT-D patients . Early reaction to clinical events may improve overall patient care. ABSTRACT  Changes in intrathoracic impedance ( Z ) leading to crossing of a derived fluid index ( FI ) threshold has been associated with heart failure ( HF ) hospitalization . A total of 400 uploads were completed during the 4-month study period . During this period , 34 patients ( 18 % ) had an FI threshold crossing , averaging 0.52 FI threshold crossings per patient-year . Thirty-two of 34 patients contacted by telephone ( 94 % ) with FI threshold crossing had evidence of CREs during this period . However , only 6 ( 18 % ) had HF hospitalizations , 19 ( 56 % ) had reported changes in HF therapy , and 13 ( 38 % ) reported drug and /or dietary plan nonadherence . Our pilot observations suggested that Internet-based remote monitoring of Z trends from existing device interrogation uploads is feasible as part of a daily routine of HF disease management. ABSTRACT  BACKGROUND Previous studies have demonstrated that intrathoracic impedance monitoring ( IIM ) is associated with fluid overload . However , it remains unclear whether this new technology can predict heart failure ( HF ) before deterioration . The primary endpoint was the positive predictive value ( PPV ) at 12 months . Secondary endpoints were a correlation between onset of HF and IIM , optimal threshold of fluid index and duration between the alert and HF . Complete follow-up clinical data were obtained from 111 patients . During the observational period , 168 alerts were confirmed from 68 patients . In patient-based analysis ( alert-based analysis ) , PPV was 33.8 % ( 33.9 % ) . Sensitivity , specificity and false positive was 67.6 % ( 83.8 % ) , 49.4 % ( 28.4 % ) and 50.6 % ( 71.6 % ) , respectively . Mean duration between the alert and HF event was 21.4 \\u00b1 6.1 days .. ABSTRACT  Purpose To determine the association between device-determined diagnostic indices , including intrathoracic impedance , and heart failure ( HF ) hospitalization . Results Mean follow-up was 326 \\u00b1 216 days . Both TCE duration and patient activity were also significantly associated with hospitalization . Kaplan Meier analysis indicated that patients with more TCE events were significantly more likely to be hospitalized ( log rank test , p = 0.005 ) . Conclusions Decreased intrathoracic impedance , low patient activity and low HRV were all independently associated with increased risk for HF hospitalization in HF patients treated with resynchronization therapy . Device-derived diagnostic data may provide valuable and reliable indices for the prognostic stratification of HF patients. ABSTRACT  A secondary objective was to compare the rates of CV health care utilization between patients in the remote and in-office arms . BACKGROUND In addition to providing life-saving therapy , implantable cardioverter-defibrillators collect advanced diagnostics on the progression of the patient 's heart disease . Device technology has progressed to allow wireless remote monitoring with automatic clinician alerts to replace some scheduled in-office visits . Health care utilization data included all CV-related hospitalizations , emergency department visits , and clinic office visits . RESULTS The median time from clinical event to clinical decision per patient was reduced from 22 days in the in-office arm to 4.6 days in the remote arm ( p < 0.001 ) . ( Clinical Evaluation of Remote Notification to Reduce Time to Clinical Decision [ CONNECT ] ; NCT00402246 ). ABSTRACT  BACKGROUND Hospitalizations due to decompensation are a frequent problem in treating patients with congestive heart failure ( CHF ) . Continuous impedance measurement via implantable devices may detect pulmonary fluid accumulation due to worsening CHF . An acoustic alert might allow an earlier treatment of impending decompensation . An algorithm that implemented impedance measurement into clinical decision making in treating CHF patients was evaluated . RESULTS During 18 + /- 4 months , 45 alerts were treated according to the algorithm . Two category 3 alerts ( normal BNP ) received no treatment . CONCLUSIONS Automatic impedance measurement can be integrated into CHF management .. ABSTRACT  The sample consists of 284 patients with heart failure . On average , patients in the telehomecare groups had a lower probability of hospitalizations and ED visits than did patients in the control group . Differences were statistically significant at 60 days but not 120 days . Results show a greater reduction in symptoms for patients using telehomecare compared to control patients .. ABSTRACT  PURPOSE Some implantable cardioverter-defibrillators ( ICDs ) are now able to monitor intrathoracic impedance . A clinical event ( CE ) was deemed to have occurred if it result ed in hospitalization or milder manifestations of HF deterioration . Three hundred sixty-two acute decreases in intrathoracic impedance ( Z events ) occurred in 230 patients . Of these episodes , 171 ( 47 % ) were associated with a CE within 2 weeks of the Z event . The rate of unexplained Z events was 0.25 per patient-year and 25 hospitalizations were not associated with Z events . The audible alert was disabled in a group of 102 patients ( OFF group ) . HF hospitalizations occurred in 29 ( 7 % ) patients in the ON group and 20 ( 20 % , P < 0.001 ) patients in the OFF group . The rate of combined cardiac death and HF hospitalization was lower in patients with Alert ON ( log-rank test , P = 0.007 ) . CONCLUSIONS The ICD reliably detected CE and yielded low rates of unexplained and undetected events . The alert capability seemed to reduce the number of HF hospitalizations by allowing timely detection and therapeutic intervention. ABSTRACT  AIMS Early recognition of impending decompensation and timely intervention may prevent heart failure ( HF ) hospitalization . METHODS AND RESULTS SENSE-HF was a prospect i ve , multi-centre study that enrolled 501 patients . Sensitivity appeared to be dynamic in nature and at the end of Phase I , had increased to 42.1 % . With 253 OptiVol detections , PPV for Phase I was 4.7 % . A total of 233 patients noted such an OptiVol alert and for 210 , HF status was evaluated within 30 days . Heart failure status had worsened for 80 patients ( PPV = 38.1 % ) . Sensitivity improved within the first 6 months after implant . Further studies are needed to assess the place of this monitoring technology in the clinical management of patients with HF. ABSTRACT  BACKGROUND Some implantable devices continuously monitor HF device diagnostic information , but data are limited on the ability of combined HF device diagnostics to predict HF events . HF events were independently adjudicated . A combined HF device diagnostic algorithm was developed on an independent data set . We used univariate and multivariable analyses to determine predictors of subsequent HF events within a month . RESULTS We analyzed data from 694 CRT defibrillator patients who were followed for 11.7 + /- 2 months . Ninety patients had 141 adjudicated HF  hospitalizations with pulmonary congestion  at least 60 days after implantation . CONCLUSIONS Monthly review of HF device diagnostic data identifies patients at a higher risk of HF hospitalizations within the subsequent month . ( PARTNERS HF : Program to Access and Review Trending Information and Evaluate Correlation to Symptoms in Patients With Heart Failure ; NCT00279955 ). ABSTRACT  Daily impedance changes were used to calculate a fluid index that could be compared with a prespecified threshold . Unexplained detections were defined as threshold crossings or acute weight gains not associated with worsening HF . Impedance measurements were performed on > 99 % of follow-up days , compared with only 76 % of days for weight measurements . Sixty-five HF events occurred during follow-up ( 0.32/patient-year ) . Forty HF events were detected by impedance but not weight , whereas 5 were detected by weight but not impedance . The sensitivity and unexplained detection rate  of intrathoracic  impedance monitoring was superior to that seen for acute weight changes .

In a cohort study , mortality , morbidity , and length of stay were compared between ERAS patients and carefully matched historical controls . The primary outcome measures of this study were mortality and morbidity . Secondary outcome measures were fluid intake , length of hospital stay , the number of relaparotomies , and the number of readmissions within 30 days . Data on the ERAS patients were collected prospect ively . Results Sixty-one patients treated according to the ERAS program were compared with 122 patients who received conventional postoperative care . Morbidity was lower in the ERAS group compared to the control group ( 14.8 % versus 33.6 % respectively ; P = < 0.01 ) . There was no difference between the ERAS and the control group for mortality ( 0 % vs. 1.6 % ; P = 0.55 ) and readmission rate ( 3.3 % vs. 1.6 % ; P = 0.60 ) . Conclusion Enhanced Recovery After Surgery program  reduces morbidity and the length of hospital stay for patients undergoing elective colonic or rectal surgery. ABSTRACT  BACKGROUND Studies have shown the value of using fast-track postoperative recovery . St and ard procedures ( non-fast-track strategies ) remain in common use for perioperative care . Few prospect i ve reports exist on the outcome of fast-tracking in Central Europe . A design ed protocol was used in the FT group with the emphasis on an interdisciplinary approach . The control group ( non-FT ) was treated by st and ard established procedures . Postoperative pain , rehabilitation , gastrointestinal functions , postoperative complications , and post-op length of stay were recorded . RESULTS Of 105 patients , 103 were statistically analyzed . Patients in the FT group ( n=51 ) and non-FT group ( n=52 ) did not differ in age , surgical diagnosis , or procedure . Food tolerance was significantly better in the FT group and rehabilitation was also faster . There were no deaths and no patients were readmitted within 30 days . CONCLUSIONS Following the FT protocol helped to reduce frequency of postoperative complications and reduced hospital stay . We conclude that the FT strategy is safe and effective in improving postoperative outcomes. ABSTRACT  The aim of this trial was to compare  multimodal optimization  with  conventional perioperative management  in a consecutive series of patients undergoing a wide range of colorectal procedures. ABSTRACT  Background : To evaluate the feasibility of a fast-track ( FT ) program and it \\u2019s effect on postoperative recovery . Methods : All patients , scheduled for elective segmental colorectal resection were treated in a FT program ( FT group ) . Data were compared to a control group operated for elective colorectal resections and treated in a traditional care program ( TC group ) . Data from the FT group were collected prospect ively , data from the TC group retrospectively . Results : One-hundred and seven patients were included ( 55 FT group vs. 52 TC group ) . The groups were comparable for patient characteristics such as age and cr-POSSUM score ( p = 0.22 and p = 0.40 ) . An average of 7.4 of 13 predefined FT modalities were successfully achieved per patient . Patient satisfaction was comparable ( p = 0.84 ) . Seven versus 5 patients required a re-operation in the FT and TC groups , respectively ( p = 0.52 ) . Morbidity rate was comparable ( n = 16 vs. 15 , p = 0.83 ) . Six vs. 3 patients were re-admitted in the FT and TC groups , respectively ( p = 0.49 ) . Conclusion : Implementation of all FT modalities was difficult since a rather low number of pre-defined FT modalities was effectively realized . Despite incomplete implementation , PHS and THS were shorter in the FT group without affecting patient satisfaction. ABSTRACT  Multimodal optimization of surgical care has been associated with reduced hospital stay and improved physical function . The aim of this r and omized trial was to compare multimodal optimization with st and ard care in patients undergoing colonic resection. ABSTRACT  Outcome measures included pulmonary function , duration of postoperative ileus , pain perception , fatigue , morbidity , and mortality . Demographic and operative data were similar for the two groups . On the 1st postoperative day , pulmonary function was improved ( p = 0.01 ) in fast-track patients . Oral feeding was achieved earlier ( p < 0.01 ) and defecation occurred earlier ( p < 0.01 ) in the fast-track group . Morbidity was not different for the two groups . Fast-track patients were discharged on day 4 ( range , 3\\u20136 ) and st and ard-care patients on day 7 ( range , 4\\u201314 ) ( p < 0.001 ) . Conclusion Multimodal rehabiliation can improve further on the excellent results of laparoscopic sigmoidectomy and decrease the postoperative hospital stay. ABSTRACT  OBJECTIVE To investigate the feasibility of a 48-hour postoperative stay program after colonic resection . Limiting factors for early recovery include stress-induced organ dysfunction , paralytic ileus , pain , and fatigue . Postoperative follow-up was scheduled at 8 and 30 days . RESULTS Median age was 74 years , with 20 patients in ASA group III-IV . There were no cardiopulmonary complications . Such a program may also reduce postoperative ileus and cardiopulmonary complications .. ABSTRACT  Although several protocol s have been reported to reduce postoperative stay , no Level I evidence exists for their use in routine clinical practice . Subgroups were defined to evaluate those who derived the optimal benefit from the protocol . Patients younger than 70 years old had greater benefits than the overall study group ( 5 vs. 7.1 days ; P = 0.01 ) . Patients treated by surgeons with the most experience with the pathway spent significantly less time in the hospital than did those whose surgeons were less experienced with the pathway ( P = 0.01 ) . There was no difference between pathway and traditional patients for readmission or complication rates , pain score , quality of life after surgery , or overall satisfaction with the hospital stay . CONCLUSIONS : Patients scheduled for a laparotomy and major intestinal or rectal resection  are suitable for management by a pathway of controlled rehabilitation with early ambulation and diet . Pathway patients have a shorter hospital stay , with no adverse effect on patient satisfaction , pain scores , or complication rates . Patients younger than 70 years of age derive the optimal benefit , and increased surgeon experience improves outcome. ABSTRACT  Adherence to both regimens was reinforced using a daily checklist and protocol guidance sheets . Discharge decision was made using preagreed criteria . The primary endpoint was postoperative stay , and achievement of independence milestones . Secondary endpoints were postoperative complications , readmission rates , and mortality . Analysis was by intention to treat . Results : Seventy patients were recruited . Approximately one fourth underwent TME . Median ages were similar ( 69.3 vs. 73.0 years ) . Patients in the multimodal group had less cardiorespiratory and anastomotic complications but more readmissions . There were 2 deaths , both controls . Morbidity and mortality are not increased. ABSTRACT  Emergency operations were not included . All patients were treated with intravenous and oral antibiotics prior to surgery . The patients in the MBP group received Soffodex for bowel preparation . RESULTS A total of 329 patients participated in the study , 165 without MBP and 164 with MBP . The 2 groups were similar in age , sex , and type of surgical procedure . However , this difference was not statistically significant . CONCLUSION Our results suggest that no advantage is gained by preoperative MBP in elective colorectal surgery. ABSTRACT  Recent studies have suggested that MBP does not lower the risk of postoperative septic complications after elective colorectal surgery . This r and omized clinical trial assessed whether preoperative MBP is beneficial in elective colonic surgery. ABSTRACT  This study was design ed to investigate the physiologic effects of bowel preparation . Fluid and food intake were st and ardized according to weight , providing adequate calorie and oral fluid intake . No differences in plasma or extracellular volumes were seen . Orthostatic tolerance and balance function did not change after bowel preparation . CONCLUSIONS : Bowel preparation has significant adverse physiologic effects , which may be attributed to dehydration .. ABSTRACT  Postoperative organ dysfunction contributes to morbidity , hospital stay and convalescence .\",\n          \" Inguinal hernias in women are relatively rare , and an outcome in this specific subgroup of hernias has not been documented in the literature . The reoperation rate was independent of the type of surgical repair . In 41.5 % of the reoperations a femoral hernia was found , compared to 5.4 % in males . Female inguinal herniorrhaphy is followed by a higher reoperation rate than in males , and is unrelated to the type of repair . The frequent finding of a femoral hernia at reoperation suggests the need for the exploration of the femoral canal at the primary operation. ABSTRACT  The European Hernia Society ( EHS ) is proud to present the EHS Guidelines for the Treatment of  Inguinal Hernia in Adult Patients . The Guidelines contain recommendations for the treatment of inguinal hernia from diagnosis till aftercare . They have been developed by a Working Group consisting of expert surgeons with representatives of 14 country members of the EHS . They are evidence -based and , when necessary , a consensus was reached among all members . The Guidelines have been review ed by a Steering Committee . Before finalisation , feedback from different national hernia societies was obtained . The  Appraisal of Guidelines for REsearch and Evaluation ( AGREE ) instrument was used by the Cochrane Association to vali date the Guidelines . The Guidelines can be used to adjust local protocol s , for training purpose s and quality control . Developing guidelines leads to questions that remain to be answered by specific research . In addition , a short summary , specifically for the general practitioner , is given . The most important challenge now will be the implementation of the Guidelines in daily surgical practice . This remains an important task for the EHS . Working together on this project was a great learning experience , and it was worthwhile and fun .. ABSTRACT  BACKGROUND An association between smoking and impaired wound healing has been reported in retrospective studies . The smoking status of a surgical patient may be confounded by social and medical parameters . We have evaluated the effect of smoking in a test wound in volunteers , with special reference to a reliable scientific match between smokers and nonsmokers . RESULTS The nonsmokers had a 1.8 times higher median amount of hydroxyproline than the smokers ( p < 0.01 ) . The impairment was specific for the production of collagenous proteins and not other proteins . CONCLUSIONS The synthesis of subcutaneous collagen in smokers is specifically impeded , indicating an impaired wound-healing process .. ABSTRACT  Background Large-scale data for the optimal inguinal hernia repair in younger men with an indirect hernia is not available . We analysed nationwide data for risk of reoperation in younger men after a primary repair using a Lichtenstein operation or a conventional non-mesh hernia repair . We included only men between the age of 18 and 30 years with a primary repair of a primary indirect inguinal hernia . The observation time after  conventional hernia repair  was median 62 months ( range 0\\u201396 ) and 41 months ( range 0\\u201396 ) after a Lichtenstein repair . Conclusions Lichtenstein repair for an indirect inguinal hernia reduces the risk of recurrence in young men between the age of 18 and 30 years compared with a sutured repair . The use of a Lichtenstein mesh repair in young males must be balanced against the risk of chronic pain. ABSTRACT  The present study evaluated TAPP based on prospect i ve documentation. ABSTRACT  BACKGROUND We sought to determine perioperative variables predictive of complications or recurrence for patients undergoing surgical repair of inguinal hernias . RESULTS Recurrent and scrotal hernias were predictors for short term and overall complications , regardless of technique . Long-term pain complaints decreased as patient age increased in both groups . Patient and surgeon factors were predictive of recurrence but varied greatly depending on surgical technique . CONCLUSIONS Regardless of technique , scrotal and recurrent hernias were associated with a greater risk of complications and younger patients had more long-term pain . Predictors of recurrence vary based on surgical technique. ABSTRACT  Cigarette smokers deposit less collagen , expressed as hydroxyproline , in granulation tissue than nonsmokers . We studied the effect of abstinence from smoking and transdermal nicotine patches on deposition of hydroxyproline , proline , type I procollagen , and total proteins . Fifty-four healthy smokers were studied during 10 days of smoking and again from days 10 to 20 following smoking cessation . During this period and during smoking , an exp and ed polytetrafluoroethylene tube was implanted into the subcutis . Following removal of the implant , total amino acids and peptides were extracted . We conclude that 20 days of abstinence from smoking does not affect collagen deposition in granulation tissue . However , in abstinent smokers , transdermal nicotine patches appears to increase type I collagen synthesis. ABSTRACT  OBJECTIVE To establish a register of  inguinal hernia surgery  that allows audit and analyses of data from several centres . DESIGN Prospect i ve recording of data on a common protocol . SETTING Eight Swedish hospitals . RESULTS During the three years studied 4879 hernia operations were undertaken in 4474 patients . Of all herniorrhaphies 798 ( 16 % ) were done for recurrences , 142 of these after operations between 1992 and 1994 .. ABSTRACT  Objective :  Inguinal  hernias are very common disorders , especially in men , with inguinal herniorrhaphy being one of the most frequently performed general surgical procedures in men . Theoretically , obesity might increase the risk of groin hernia by increasing intra-abdominal pressure . Main Outcome Measures : A diagnosis of groin hernia according to the Swedish hospital discharge register . Results : A total of 1017 men ( 13.6 % ) were diagnosed with groin hernia . An inverse relationship was found between body mass index ( BMI ) and risk of groin hernia . With each BMI unit ( 3\\u20134 kg ) , the relative risk for groin hernia decreased by 4 % ( P < 0.0001 ) . Compared with men of normal weight , obese men had a 43 % lower risk ( P = 0.0008 , 95 % confidence interval 21%\\u201359 % ) . Heavy smokers demonstrated a 26 % lower risk for groin hernia ( P = 0.003 , 95 % confidence interval 10%\\u201339 % ) . Diabetes , high physical activity , and blood pressure were not associated with groin hernia . Obesity , in comparison with normal weight , reduced the risk of groin hernia by 43 % . A reduced risk of groin hernia was also noted in heavy smokers . Obviously , hernia may be more easily detected in lean men but a true protective effect can not be excluded. ABSTRACT  During surgery , both inguinal and femoral canal orifices were routinely inspected . The presence of unilateral or bilateral inguinal and femoral hernias was recorded and repaired accordingly . Results There were a total of 362 patients . More males ( 343 , 95 % ) underwent a TEP hernia repair than females ( 19 , 5 % ) . There were more cases of unilateral ( 240/362 , 66 % ) than bilateral ( 122/362 , 34 % ) inguinal hernias . A total of 18 cases of synchronous femoral hernias were found during operation . None of the femoral hernias were clinical ly detectable preoperatively . Conclusion Females undergoing elective inguinal hernia repair are more likely to have a synchronous femoral hernia than males . We suggest that all women presenting with an inguinal hernia also have a formal assessment of the femoral canal .. ABSTRACT  Methods Data were retrieved for all groin hernia repairs prospect ively recorded in the Swedish Hernia register from 1996 to 1998 . Actuarial analysis adjusted for patients \\u2019 death was used for calculating the cumulative incidence of reoperation . Relative risk for reoperation was estimated using the Cox proportional hazards model . At 24 months the risk for having had a reoperation was 4.6 % after recurrent hernia repair and 1.7 % after primary hernia repair . The relative risk for reoperation was significantly lower for laparoscopic methods and for anterior tension-free repair than for other techniques . Postoperative complications and direct hernia were associated with an increased relative risk for reoperation . Day-case surgery and local infiltration anesthesia were used less frequently for recurrent hernia than for primary hernia . Conclusions Recurrent groin hernia still constitutes a significant quantitative problem for the surgical community . This study supports the use of mesh by laparoscopy or anterior tension-free repair for recurrent hernia operations. ABSTRACT  OBJECTIVE To find out whether simultaneous repair of bilateral hernias increases the risk of recurrence compared with unilateral repair . DESIGN Prospect i ve study . SETTING Swedish hospitals participating in the Swedish Hernia Register ( SHR ) . INTERVENTIONS Prospect i ve collection of data from the SHR , 1992 - 1999 inclusive . The Cox proportional hazard test was used for calculating odds ratio ( OR ) . RESULTS 33416 unilateral and 1487 bilateral operations on 2974 groin hernias were found . The OR for reoperation after laparoscopic bilateral repair compared with open bilateral repair was 0.9 ( 95 % CI 0.6 to 1.4 ) .. ABSTRACT  RESULTS In our study , 5524 consecutive patients underwent 6860 laparoscopic hernia repairs . ( 19/1336 ) . Bilateral inguinal hernia is an ideal indication for endoscopic transabdominal repair. ABSTRACT  OBJECTIVES To examine the relationship between operating time and reoperation for recurrence and other complications in groin hernia repairs . DESIGN Observational population -based register study . SETTING Data from the nationwide Swedish Hernia Register , which prospect ively collects data from almost all groin hernia repairs performed in Sweden . PATIENTS There were 123,917 primary groin hernia repairs recorded in the Swedish Hernia Register from January 1 , 1998 , through December 31 , 2007 . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Relative risk of reoperation for recurrence and odds ratios for postoperative complications in 4 operating time groups . Because the Lichtenstein procedure is the st and ard procedure in Sweden today , its results were also analyzed separately . In this homogeneous group , the difference was even more striking with an increased relative risk of 45 % ( 1.45 ; 95 % CI , 1.21 - 1.75 ) . The odds ratio for infection and other postoperative complications increased with increasing operating time .. ABSTRACT  Objective : To describe the characteristics of patients undergoing multiple groin hernia repairs  and to identify strategies that prevent further recurrence . Low numbers and heterogeneity have made it difficult to perform large prospect i ve studies on this group . Methods : The study was design ed as an observational population -based register study . All repairs for recurrent hernia recorded in the Swedish Hernia Register ( SHR ) 1992\\u20132006 were identified . The risk for further reoperation increased with the number of previous repairs ( P < 0.001 ) . The difference between Lichtenstein repair and laparoscopic repair was significant for the first 2 repairs ( P < 0.05 ) . Conclusion : Laparoscopic preperitoneal repair provides the best surgical outcome in repeated groin hernia recurrence. ABSTRACT  Objectives : We examined the influence of surgeon age and other factors on proficiency in laparoscopic or open hernia repair . We have also reported significant differences in RR for the open procedure related to resident postgraduate year ( PGY ) level . Methods : We analyzed data from unilateral laparoscopic and open herniorrhaphies from CSP 456 ( n = 1629 ) . Results : Age was dichotomized into older ( \\u226545 years ) and younger ( < 45 years ) . Surgeon 's inexperience and older age were significant predictors of recurrence in laparoscopic herniorrhaphy . The odds of recurrence for an inexperienced surgeon aged 45 years or older was 1.72 times that of a younger inexperienced surgeon . For open repairs , only a median PGY level of <3 was a significant risk factor. ABSTRACT  OBJECTIVE Analysis of reoperation and recurrence rates three years after repair of groin hernias . DESIGN Prospect i ve audit by question naire and selective follow-up . SETTING Eight Swedish hospitals . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Postoperative complications , reoperation for recurrence , and recurrence . RESULTS During 1992 , 1565 hernia operations were done . The postoperative complication rate was 8 % ( 125/1565 ) . The interhospital variation in recurrence rate ranged from 3 % to 20 % .. ABSTRACT  05 ) of 1562ng mL(-1 ) against the CG 684ng mL(-1 ) . 5ng mL(-1 ) of the CG ( statistical significance of P<0 ( . ) 05 ) . DISCUSSION The MMP-2 and TIMP-2 levels were concurrently elevated only in the recurrent hernia group .\",\n          \" BACKGROUND Heart failure treatment guidelines emphasize daily weight monitoring for patients with heart failure , but data to support this practice are lacking . METHODS This was a r and omized , controlled trial . The primary end point was 6-month hospital readmission rate . Mean age was 59 + /- 15 years and 68 % were male . No differences in hospitalization rates were observed . There was a 56.2 % reduction in mortality ( P < .003 ) for patients r and omized to the AlereNet group .. ABSTRACT  We hypothesized that early intervention could prevent hospitalizations and affect outcome . All devices featured a monitoring tool to track changes in intrathoracic impedance ( OptiVol ) and other diagnostic parameters . The primary end point was a composite of all-cause mortality and heart failure hospitalizations . Clinical Trial Registration \\u2014 URL : http://www . clinical trials.gov . Unique identifier : NCT 00480077. ABSTRACT  Clinical HF status and device data were assessed at enrolment , during regular follow-up , and if patients presented with an alert or HF deterioration . Data from 373 subjects were analysed . Higher NYHA class at baseline was predictive for adequate alert events during follow-up ( P < 0.05 ) . In 11 of 20 HF deteriorations without preceding alert , an upstroke of the fluid index occurred without reaching the programmed alert threshold . CONCLUSION A device-based algorithm that alerts patients in case of decreasing intrathoracic impedance facilitates the detection of HF deterioration .. ABSTRACT  Conventional approaches to the early detection of pulmonary and systemic congestion have been shown to be of limited sensitivity . While once thought to hold great promise , results from recent prospect i ve studies on telemonitoring strategies have proven disappointing . Conventional electrophysiologic parameters and intrathoracic impedance data are currently available in the growing population of heart failure patients with equipped devices . A variety of implantable hemodynamic monitors are currently under investigation . How best to integrate these devices into a systematic approach to the management of patients before , during , and after AHFS  is yet to be established. ABSTRACT  BACKGROUND Heart failure is associated with a high rate of hospitalization and poor prognosis . Telemonitoring could help implement and maintain effective therapy and detect worsening heart failure and its cause promptly to prevent medical crises . HTM consisted of twice-daily patient self-measurement of weight , blood pressure , heart rate , and rhythm with automated devices linked to a cardiology center . The NTS consisted of specialist nurses who were available to patients by telephone . Primary care physicians delivered UC . The primary end point was days dead or hospitalized with NTS versus HTM at 240 days . During 240 days of follow-up , 19.5 % , 15.9 % , and 12.7 % of days were lost as the result of death or hospitalization for UC , NTS , and HTM , respectively ( no significant difference ) . CONCLUSIONS Further investigation and refinement of the application of HTM are warranted because it may be a valuable role for the management of selected patients with heart failure. ABSTRACT  METHODS AND RESULTS A total of 188 consented and eligible patients were r and omized between intervention and control groups in 1:1 ratio . Subjects r and omized to the intervention arm received the SPAN-CHF disease management program in conjunction with the AHM system . The primary end point was prespecified as the relative event rate of HF hospitalization between intervention and control groups at 90 days . The relative event rate of HF hospitalization for the intervention group compared with controls was 0.50 ( 95%CI [ 0.25 - 0.99 ] , P = .05 ) . CONCLUSIONS Short-term reductions in the heart failure hospitalization rate were associated with the use of automated home monitoring equipment . Long-term benefits in this model remain to be studied. ABSTRACT  BACKGROUND Heart failure is a common and important cause of morbidity and mortality . Nurses also screened patients for heart failure exacerbations , which they managed with supplemental diuretics or by contacting the primary physician for instructions . Outcomes included time to hospital encounter , mortality , number and cost of hospitalizations , functional status , and satisfaction with care . The number of admissions , hospital days , and hospital costs were significantly lower during the first 6 months after intervention but not at 1 year . The intervention had little effect on functional status , mortality , and satisfaction with care . CONCLUSION A nurse-administered , telephone-based disease management program delayed subsequent health care encounters , but had minimal impact on other outcomes. ABSTRACT  The primary end point was death from any cause or a nonfatal heart-failure event ( whichever came first ) . Heart-failure events were diagnosed by physicians who were aware of the treatment assignments , but they were adjudicated by a committee that was unaware of assignments . The benefit did not differ significantly between patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy and those with nonischemic cardiomyopathy . CRT was associated with a significant reduction in left ventricular volumes and improvement in the ejection fraction . There was no significant difference between the two groups in the overall risk of death , with a 3 % annual mortality rate in each treatment group . Serious adverse events were infrequent in the two groups . ( Clinical Trials.gov number , NCT00180271 .. ABSTRACT  Methods Patients implanted with CRT-D for more than 6 months received the CareLink monitor and were trained to perform device interrogation . At-home transmissions were scheduled at 2 weeks , 1 and 2 months after training , with a final in-office visit after 3 months . Results Sixty-seven patients performed 264 data transmissions . Twenty-three unscheduled data transmissions were requested by the centers after patient contact . Of these events , in two cases ( 15 % ) in-hospital visits were requested , while in 11 ( 85 % ) no action was needed and no additional in-clinic visits were scheduled . During the study period , in 20/28 ( 71 % ) intra-thoracic impedance alerts , the patients remotely transmitted their device data . In six episodes an in-hospital extra visit was scheduled . On the whole , in 14 cases ( 70 % ) , the patient could be managed remotely avoiding a visit to the hospital . Conclusions Our study showed that remote follow-up is an efficient method to manage tachyarrhythmias and heart failure episodes in  CRT-D patients . Early reaction to clinical events may improve overall patient care. ABSTRACT  Changes in intrathoracic impedance ( Z ) leading to crossing of a derived fluid index ( FI ) threshold has been associated with heart failure ( HF ) hospitalization . A total of 400 uploads were completed during the 4-month study period . During this period , 34 patients ( 18 % ) had an FI threshold crossing , averaging 0.52 FI threshold crossings per patient-year . Thirty-two of 34 patients contacted by telephone ( 94 % ) with FI threshold crossing had evidence of CREs during this period . However , only 6 ( 18 % ) had HF hospitalizations , 19 ( 56 % ) had reported changes in HF therapy , and 13 ( 38 % ) reported drug and /or dietary plan nonadherence . Our pilot observations suggested that Internet-based remote monitoring of Z trends from existing device interrogation uploads is feasible as part of a daily routine of HF disease management. ABSTRACT  BACKGROUND Previous studies have demonstrated that intrathoracic impedance monitoring ( IIM ) is associated with fluid overload . However , it remains unclear whether this new technology can predict heart failure ( HF ) before deterioration . The primary endpoint was the positive predictive value ( PPV ) at 12 months . Secondary endpoints were a correlation between onset of HF and IIM , optimal threshold of fluid index and duration between the alert and HF . Complete follow-up clinical data were obtained from 111 patients . During the observational period , 168 alerts were confirmed from 68 patients . In patient-based analysis ( alert-based analysis ) , PPV was 33.8 % ( 33.9 % ) . Sensitivity , specificity and false positive was 67.6 % ( 83.8 % ) , 49.4 % ( 28.4 % ) and 50.6 % ( 71.6 % ) , respectively . Mean duration between the alert and HF event was 21.4 \\u00b1 6.1 days .. ABSTRACT  Purpose To determine the association between device-determined diagnostic indices , including intrathoracic impedance , and heart failure ( HF ) hospitalization . Results Mean follow-up was 326 \\u00b1 216 days . Both TCE duration and patient activity were also significantly associated with hospitalization . Kaplan Meier analysis indicated that patients with more TCE events were significantly more likely to be hospitalized ( log rank test , p = 0.005 ) . Conclusions Decreased intrathoracic impedance , low patient activity and low HRV were all independently associated with increased risk for HF hospitalization in HF patients treated with resynchronization therapy . Device-derived diagnostic data may provide valuable and reliable indices for the prognostic stratification of HF patients. ABSTRACT  A secondary objective was to compare the rates of CV health care utilization between patients in the remote and in-office arms . BACKGROUND In addition to providing life-saving therapy , implantable cardioverter-defibrillators collect advanced diagnostics on the progression of the patient 's heart disease . Device technology has progressed to allow wireless remote monitoring with automatic clinician alerts to replace some scheduled in-office visits . Health care utilization data included all CV-related hospitalizations , emergency department visits , and clinic office visits . RESULTS The median time from clinical event to clinical decision per patient was reduced from 22 days in the in-office arm to 4.6 days in the remote arm ( p < 0.001 ) . ( Clinical Evaluation of Remote Notification to Reduce Time to Clinical Decision [ CONNECT ] ; NCT00402246 ). ABSTRACT  BACKGROUND Hospitalizations due to decompensation are a frequent problem in treating patients with congestive heart failure ( CHF ) . Continuous impedance measurement via implantable devices may detect pulmonary fluid accumulation due to worsening CHF . An acoustic alert might allow an earlier treatment of impending decompensation . An algorithm that implemented impedance measurement into clinical decision making in treating CHF patients was evaluated . RESULTS During 18 + /- 4 months , 45 alerts were treated according to the algorithm . Two category 3 alerts ( normal BNP ) received no treatment . CONCLUSIONS Automatic impedance measurement can be integrated into CHF management .. ABSTRACT  The sample consists of 284 patients with heart failure . On average , patients in the telehomecare groups had a lower probability of hospitalizations and ED visits than did patients in the control group . Differences were statistically significant at 60 days but not 120 days . Results show a greater reduction in symptoms for patients using telehomecare compared to control patients .. ABSTRACT  PURPOSE Some implantable cardioverter-defibrillators ( ICDs ) are now able to monitor intrathoracic impedance . A clinical event ( CE ) was deemed to have occurred if it result ed in hospitalization or milder manifestations of HF deterioration . Three hundred sixty-two acute decreases in intrathoracic impedance ( Z events ) occurred in 230 patients . Of these episodes , 171 ( 47 % ) were associated with a CE within 2 weeks of the Z event . The rate of unexplained Z events was 0.25 per patient-year and 25 hospitalizations were not associated with Z events . The audible alert was disabled in a group of 102 patients ( OFF group ) . HF hospitalizations occurred in 29 ( 7 % ) patients in the ON group and 20 ( 20 % , P < 0.001 ) patients in the OFF group . The rate of combined cardiac death and HF hospitalization was lower in patients with Alert ON ( log-rank test , P = 0.007 ) . CONCLUSIONS The ICD reliably detected CE and yielded low rates of unexplained and undetected events . The alert capability seemed to reduce the number of HF hospitalizations by allowing timely detection and therapeutic intervention. ABSTRACT  AIMS Early recognition of impending decompensation and timely intervention may prevent heart failure ( HF ) hospitalization . METHODS AND RESULTS SENSE-HF was a prospect i ve , multi-centre study that enrolled 501 patients . Sensitivity appeared to be dynamic in nature and at the end of Phase I , had increased to 42.1 % . With 253 OptiVol detections , PPV for Phase I was 4.7 % . A total of 233 patients noted such an OptiVol alert and for 210 , HF status was evaluated within 30 days . Heart failure status had worsened for 80 patients ( PPV = 38.1 % ) . Sensitivity improved within the first 6 months after implant . Further studies are needed to assess the place of this monitoring technology in the clinical management of patients with HF. ABSTRACT  BACKGROUND Some implantable devices continuously monitor HF device diagnostic information , but data are limited on the ability of combined HF device diagnostics to predict HF events . HF events were independently adjudicated . A combined HF device diagnostic algorithm was developed on an independent data set . We used univariate and multivariable analyses to determine predictors of subsequent HF events within a month . RESULTS We analyzed data from 694 CRT defibrillator patients who were followed for 11.7 + /- 2 months . Ninety patients had 141 adjudicated HF  hospitalizations with pulmonary congestion  at least 60 days after implantation . CONCLUSIONS Monthly review of HF device diagnostic data identifies patients at a higher risk of HF hospitalizations within the subsequent month . ( PARTNERS HF : Program to Access and Review Trending Information and Evaluate Correlation to Symptoms in Patients With Heart Failure ; NCT00279955 ). ABSTRACT  Daily impedance changes were used to calculate a fluid index that could be compared with a prespecified threshold . Unexplained detections were defined as threshold crossings or acute weight gains not associated with worsening HF . Impedance measurements were performed on > 99 % of follow-up days , compared with only 76 % of days for weight measurements . Sixty-five HF events occurred during follow-up ( 0.32/patient-year ) . Forty HF events were detected by impedance but not weight , whereas 5 were detected by weight but not impedance . The sensitivity and unexplained detection rate  of intrathoracic  impedance monitoring was superior to that seen for acute weight changes . Intrathoracic impedance monitoring represents a useful adjunctive clinical tool for managing HF in patients with implanted devices\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The European R and omized study of Screening for Prostate cancer ( ERSPC ) was initiated in 1994 . Eight countries including France are participating . Men aged 50 - 74 and living in the Tarn or H\\u00e9rault were included . In case of PSA greater than or equal to 3 ng/ml , biopsy was recommended . Included men in both screening and control group were followed through cancer registries . Participation rate was 36.9 % in Tarn and 24.3 % in H\\u00e9rault . Corresponding RR for Tarn and H\\u00e9rault were 1.37 and 1.20 respectively . CONCLUSION Participation rate at first round was modest . Profile of men who participated compared to men who did not were different . The control group was probably contaminated by PSA testing outside study protocol . Consequences at ERSPC level of this low participation rate on final analysis remain to be determined. ABSTRACT  The design is a multicenter , two-armed , r and omized trial with 37,000 females and 37,000 males in each of the two arms . In the intervention arm , the  PSA and CA125 tests  are performed at entry , then annually for 5 years . The  DRE , TVU , and chest X-ray exams  are performed at entry and then annually for 3 years . Sigmoidoscopy is performed at entry and then at the 5-year point . This paper describes eligibility , consent , and other design features of the trial , r and omization and screening procedures , and an outline of the follow-up procedures . Sample -size calculations are reported , and a data analysis plan is presented. ABSTRACT  We evaluated mortality results in the Finnish Prostate Cancer Screening Trial , the largest component of ERSPC . The primary endpoint was PC-specific mortality . Men in the CA received usual care . The analysis covers follow-up to 12 years from r and omization for all men . Hazard ratios ( HRs ) were estimated for incidence and mortality using Cox proportional hazard model . All statistical tests were two-sided . To avoid one PC death , we needed to invite 1199 men to screening and to detect 25 PCs . We observed no difference in all-cause mortality between trial arms .. ABSTRACT  BACKGROUND Prostate cancer is one of the leading causes of death from malignant disease among men in the developed world . One strategy to decrease the risk of death from this disease is screening with prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) ; however , the extent of benefit and harm with such screening is under continuous debate . The primary endpoint was prostate-cancer specific mortality , analysed according to the intention-to-screen principle . The study is ongoing , with men who have not reached the upper age limit invited for PSA testing . This is the first planned report on cumulative prostate-cancer incidence and mortality calculated up to Dec 31 , 2008 . This study is registered as an International St and ard R and omised Controlled Trial IS RCT N54449243 . FINDINGS In each group , 48 men were excluded from the analysis because of death or emigration before the r and omisation date , or prevalent prostate cancer . In men r and omised to screening , 7578 ( 76 % ) of 9952 attended at least once . The rate ratio for death from prostate cancer was 0.56 ( 95 % CI 0.39 - 0.82 ; p=0.002 ) in the screening compared with the control group . The rate ratio of death from prostate cancer for attendees compared with the control group was 0.44 ( 95 % CI 0.28 - 0.68 ; p=0.0002 ) . INTERPRETATION This study shows that prostate cancer mortality was reduced almost by half over 14 years . However , the risk of over-diagnosis is substantial and the number needed to treat is at least as high as in breast-cancer screening programmes . The benefit of prostate-cancer screening compares favourably to other cancer screening programs . FUNDING The Swedish Cancer Society , the Swedish Research Council , and the National Cancer Institute. ABSTRACT  Objective To assess whether screening for prostate cancer reduces prostate cancer specific mortality . Design Population based r and omised controlled trial . Setting Department of Urology , Norrk\\u00f6ping , and the South-East Region Prostate Cancer Register . These men were invited to be screened every third year from 1987 to 1996 . On the first two occasions screening was done by digital rectal examination only . From 1993 , this was combined with prostate specific antigen testing , with 4 \\u00b5g/L as cut off . On the fourth occasion ( 1996 ) , only men aged 69 or under at the time of the investigation were invited . Prostate cancer specific mortality up to 31 December 2008 . There were 85 cases ( 5.7 % ) of prostate cancer diagnosed in the screened group and 292 ( 3.9 % ) in the control group . After adjustment for age at start of the study , the hazard ratio was 1.58 ( 1.06 to 2.36 ; P=0.024 ) . Trial registration Current Controlled Trials , IS RCT N06342431. ABSTRACT  This is the first report from the Prostate , Lung , Colorectal , and Ovarian ( PLCO ) Cancer Screening Trial on prostate-cancer mortality . Men in the screening group were offered annual PSA testing for 6 years and digital rectal examination for 4 years . The subjects and health care providers received the results and decided on the type of follow-up evaluation . Usual care sometimes included screening , as some organizations have recommended . The numbers of all cancers and deaths and causes of death were ascertained . RESULTS In the screening group , rates of compliance were 85 % for PSA testing and 86 % for digital rectal examination . The data at 10 years were 67 % complete and consistent with these overall findings . ( Clinical Trials.gov number , NCT00002540 .. ABSTRACT  Mortality after 7 - 10 years of follow-up has been reported previously . We report extended follow-up to 13 years after the trial . Screening was completed in October 2006 . All incident prostate cancers and deaths from prostate cancer through 13 years of follow-up or through December 31 , 2009 , were ascertained . All statistical tests were two-sided . RESULTS Approximately 92 % of the study participants were followed to 10 years and 57 % to 13 years . At 13 years , 4250 participants had been diagnosed with prostate cancer in the intervention arm compared with 3815 in the control arm .. ABSTRACT  PURPOSE This clinical trial is aim ed at evaluating the impact of prostate cancer screening on cancer-specific mortality . At follow-up visits , serum PSA only was used . Median follow-up of screened men was 7.93 years . These results are in agreement with the continuous decrease of prostate cancer mortality observed in North America. ABSTRACT  BACKGROUND The incidence of prostate cancer has increased substantially since it became common practice to screen asymptomatic men for the disease . Variations in the screening algorithm , such as the interval between screening rounds , likely influence the morbidity , mortality , and quality of life of the screened population . All participants who were diagnosed with prostate cancer through December 31 , 2005 , but at most 10 years after the initial screening were ascertained by linkage with the national cancer registries . We used Mantel Cox regression to assess differences between rates of interval cancers and aggressive interval cancers at the two centers . All statistical tests were two-sided . CONCLUSION The rate of interval cancer , especially aggressive interval cancer , was low in this study . The 2-year screening interval had higher detection rates than the 4-year interval but did not lead to lower rates of interval and aggressive interval prostate cancers. ABSTRACT  All men r and omized were included , only those with prostate cancer screen\\u2010detected or clinical ly diagnosed before July 1997 were omitted from the analyses . These rates were higher than those recorded at the national and regional levels , 33 and 38 per 1,000 person\\u2010years , respectively . An opposite pattern was observed in the screening arm , where participants already had received the scheduled screening within the trial . Over a 4\\u2010year rescreening interval , the average PSA and effective contamination amount were approximately 28 % and 10 % , respectively . PSA testing in the control arm in the Rotterdam ERSPC section is high , but was not followed by a substantial increase in prostate biopsies . \\u00a9 2003 Wiley\\u2010Liss ,. ABSTRACT  Date s and causes of death were collected on an annual basis . A Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to calculate overall and cancer-specific survival . RESULTS A total of 2,416 men were recruited in the screening arm and 1,862 in the control arm . Mean age was 57.8 years , median follow-up was 13.3 years . At the end of the follow-up period , 427 deaths ( 9 from PCa ) were observed . Most relevant causes of death were malignant tumors ( 52.9 % ) , cardiovascular disease ( 17.3 % ) and respiratory ( 8.9 % ) . Only 2.1 % of deaths ( 0.2 % of all recruited men ) were due to PCa ( 2.5 % screening , 1.6 % control ) . CONCLUSIONS The Spanish arm of ERSPC failed to reproduce the long-term results shown in the whole study . No differences in mortality ( overall or cancer-specific ) were observed after 15 years of follow-up . PCa mortality was infrequent ( less than 1 % ) . These results suggest limited yield of PCa screening in our setting. ABSTRACT  Screening for prostate cancer ( PC ) remains a controversial issue despite some new evidence on the mortality benefits of PC screening . We conducted a prospect i ve , r and omized screening trial in Finl and to investigate whether screening decreases PC incidence . Here , we report the incidence results from three screening rounds during a 12-year period . The mean follow-up time for PC incidence in both arms was over 9 years . The incidence of localized PC was 7.5 in the SA and 4.6 in the CA , IRR = 1.6 ( 1.5 - 1.7 ) . The results from our large population -based trial indicate that screening for PC decreases the incidence of advanced PC . When compared with the CA , the PC detected in the SA there were substantially more often localized , low- grade PCs due to overdiagnosis. ABSTRACT  To report the results from  Switzerl and 's participation in the ERSPC from 1998 ; importantly , epidemiological data showed that Switzerl and has one of the highest rates of morbidity and mortality from prostate cancer in the world . The local study protocol was accepted by the ethical committee and after the successful pilot study phase , the centre joined the ERSPC. ABSTRACT  Men were screened with PSA test at a 2 - 7 year interval depending on the centre ; PSA cut-off was 3.0 - 4.0 ng/ml . A positive screen with no histologically confirmed PC in biopsy within 1 year was defined as an FP result . RESULTS Of the 61,604 men who were screened at least once , 17.8 % had one or more FP result ( s ) . Almost 20 % of men who participated at all screening rounds had one or more FP result ( s ) . More than half of the men with an FP result had another FP if screened again . The PCs following an FP result were in 92.8 % of cases localised and low- grade versus 90.4 % following a screen-negative result . False-positive men are more prone to be diagnosed with PC but are also likely to have consistently high PSA levels. ABSTRACT  However , results analyzed by comorbidity strata remain unknown . RESULTS After 10 years of follow-up , 9,565 deaths occurred , 164 from PC . CONCLUSION Selective use of PSA screening for men in good health appears to reduce the risk of PCSM with minimal overtreatment. ABSTRACT  The specific details of the French national programme are based on the design of a local mass screening programme . The protocol includes r and omization before information and consent . In addition , knowledge of any pre\\u2010existing PSA test is obtained through the health insurance data base .. ABSTRACT  Centres recruit different age groups and have different design s for recruiting and countries have different underlying risks for prostate cancer . Recruitment has reached 163,126 men aged 55 - 69 at entry now . Our purpose was to calculate the power of the trial and at what point in time can statistically significant differences in prostate cancer mortality be expected . Recruitment data were collected from the screening centres . We calculated the expected number of prostate cancer deaths in each follow-up year , based on national statistics and expected rate in trial entrants . The power was calculated using different assumptions on intervention effect and contamination rate and also if the ERSPC trial would cooperate with other trials . With an assumed 25 % intervention effect in men actually screened and a 20 % contamination rate , the trial will reach a power of 0.86 in 2008 . With an assumed intervention effect of 40 % , the power reaches 0.90 in 2003 - 2004 . Adding more centres with compliance rates lower than 45 % decreases the power of the trial .. ABSTRACT  The principal screening method at all centers is determination of  serum prostate\\u2010specific antigen ( PSA ) . An additional 6 % was referred for further assessment based on other criteria , with much less efficiency . Differences in PSA by country are largely attributable to the age structure of the study population . Considerable progress has been made in both trials . Enrollment will be completed in 2001 . A substantial number of early prostate cancers have been detected . The differences between countries seem to reflect both underlying prostate cancer incidence and screening policy . The trials have the power to show definitive results in 2005\\u20132008 . \\u00a9 2002 Wiley\\u2010Liss ,. ABSTRACT  Prostate cancer has become the most frequent cancer and the second cause of cancer mortality in men . This public health problem is becoming increasingly important due to the increasing life expectancy . At the present time , prostate cancer will be discovered in one in every eight men during their lifetime . Prostate cancer represents 25 % of all new cases of male cancers . Prostate cancer screening is design ed to detect early stage , asymptomatic prostate cancer , as the patient 's chances of cure are higher when the cancer is diagnosed at an early stage . The conclusions of the ANAES evaluation in 1998 did not recommend mass screening for prostate cancer . If total PSA is above the normal value of the test or if digital rectal examination is abnormal , referral to a urologist is recommended . Information concerning the limits , benefits and risks of screening and the available treatment options must be given before performing these examinations. ABSTRACT  The remaining 7532 men were treated as controls . In 1987 and 1990 only  digital rectal examination ( DRE )  was performed , in 1993 and 1996 DRE was combined with a test for Prostate-Specific Antigen ( PSA ) . TNM categories , grade of malignancy , management and cause of death were recorded in the South-East Region Prostate Cancer Register . In the SG 48 ( 56.5 % ) of the tumours and in the UG 78 ( 26.7 % ) were localised at diagnosis ( p < 0.001 ) . In the SG 21 ( 25 % ) and in the UG 41 ( 14 % ) received curative treatment . There was no significant difference in total or prostate cancer-specific survival between the groups .. ABSTRACT  OBJECTIVE To describe the natural history of initially untreated early-stage prostate cancer . A key secondary objective was to calculate long-term survival rates by stage , grade , and age at diagnosis . DESIGN Prospect i ve cohort study . SETTING Population -based in 1 county of Sweden , without screening for prostate cancer . RESULTS In the entire cohort , prostate cancer accounted for 201 ( 37 % ) of all 541 deaths . Among 300 patients with a diagnosis of localized disease ( T0-T2 ) , 33 ( 11 % ) died of prostate cancer . Without reliable prognostic indicators , an aggressive approach to all patients with early disease would entail substantial overtreatment . In contrast , patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease need trials of aggressive therapy to improve their poor prognosis. ABSTRACT  PURPOSE We evaluated long-term survival in attendees and nonattendees of a 1-time screening for prostate cancer . Of the invited men 1,782 ( 74 % ) attended . Screening attendees were examined with digital rectal examination , transrectal ultrasound and prostate specific antigen analysis . When cancer was suspected , prostate biopsies were taken . A total of 65 men with prostate cancer were detected by this procedure . RESULTS Incidence rate ratios were calculated using Poisson regression models . In contrast , the corresponding incidence rate ratio in nonattendees was 1.53 ( 95 % CI 1.37 - 1.71 ) . These findings should be considered when interpreting previous and upcoming studies of the effect of screening programs. ABSTRACT  To be effective , such a program should be able to reduce the absolute number of men diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer ( for which no cure is available ) . The aim of the present report is to evaluate whether PSA-based screening reduces the risk of being diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer . METHODS A population -based , prospect i ve , r and omized , controlled screening trial for prostate cancer started in 1995 ( the G\\u00f6teborg branch of the European R and omized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer [ ERSPC ] ) . However , the risk of being diagnosed with prostate cancer increased 1.8-fold with PSA-based screening . CONCLUSIONS Biennial PSA screening reduces the risk of being diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer , the first prerequisite for achieving decreased cancer mortality  in younger men . This putative benefit is balanced by a 1.8-fold increased risk for diagnosis of prostate cancer. ABSTRACT  To report the initial results from Sweden of a large population \\u2010based r and omized study of screening using prostate\\u2010specific antigen ( PSA ) to detect prostate cancer , as the efficacy of such screening to decrease prostate cancer mortality has not yet been proven. ABSTRACT  BACKGROUND Evidence from r and omized trials on the effects of screening for prostate cancer ( PCa ) on disease-specific mortality accumulates slowly with increasing follow-up . OBJECTIVE To assess data on PCa-specific mortality in the Rotterdam section of the European R and omized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer ( ERSPC ) trial . DESIGN , SETTING , AND PARTICIPANTS A r and omized controlled trial with r and omization after signed , written informed consent ( efficacy trial ) . OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Number of PCas detected per arm depicted by predefined time periods and prognostic groups . PCa-specific mortality analyses using Poisson regression in age group 55 - 74 yr at r and omization and separately in the predefined age group of 55 - 69 yr . Thirty-two percent of all men r and omized have died . A 14.1 % increase was found in men aged 70 - 74 yr ( not statistically significant ) . Absolute PCa mortality was 1.8 per 1000 men r and omized ( 2.6 per 1000 men r and omized in age group 55 - 69 yr ) . The number needed to invite and number needed to manage were 565 and 33 , respectively , for age group 55 - 74 yr , and 392 and 24 , respectively , for age group 65 - 69 yr . Given the slow natural history of the disease , follow-up might be too short . CONCLUSIONS Systematic PSA-based screening reduced PCa-specific mortality by 32 % in the age range of 55 - 69 yr . The roughly twofold higher incidence in the S-arm underlines the importance of tools to better identify those men who would benefit from screening\",\n          \" BACKGROUND There is increased pressure on primary care physicians to monitor oral anticoagulation . METHODS A r and omized , controlled trial in 12 primary care practice s in Birmingham , Engl and ( 9 intervention and 3 control ) . Intervention practice s ' patients were r and omized to the intervention ( practice -based anticoagulation clinic ) or control ( hospital clinic ) group . The main outcome measure was therapeutic control of the international normalized ratio . St and ard measures of control of the international normalized ratio ( point prevalence ) showed no significant difference between the intervention and control groups . Care given by this model is at least as good as routine hospital follow-up . The model is generalizable to primary health care centers operating in developed health care systems. ABSTRACT  OBJECTIVE To investigate the effect of meal-related self-monitoring of blood glucose on glycemic control and well-being in non-insulin-treated type 2 diabetic patients . RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS This 6-month study , which included 6 months of follow-up , adopted a prospect i ve , multicenter , r and omized controlled design . The primary efficacy parameter was the change in HbA(1c ) . Secondary efficacy variables included changes in body weight , lipids , and microalbumin and changes in treatment satisfaction and well-being . Body weight , total cholesterol , and microalbumin improved when using a glucometer , but there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups . Treatment satisfaction increased in both groups to a similar extent ( P = 0.9 ) . Self-monitoring result ed in a marked improvement of general well-being with significant improvements in the subitems depression ( P = 0.032 ) and lack of well-being ( P = 0.02 ) . The finding of three types of responders will be important for future planning of counseling and educational interventions. ABSTRACT  Participants might ignore follow-up , leave town , or take aspartame when instructed to take aspirin . Exclusions before r and omisation do not bias the treatment comparison , but they can hurt generalisability . Eligibility criteria for a trial should be clear , specific , and applied before r and omisation . In principle , assessment of exclusions after r and omisation is simple : none are allowed . In reality , however , losses frequently occur . Investigators can also do secondary analyses on , for instance , per- protocol or as-treated participants . Such analyses should be described as secondary and non-r and omised comparisons . Mish and ling of exclusions causes serious method ological difficulties . Creative mismanagement of exclusions can undermine trial validity. ABSTRACT  CONTEXT Control of oral anticoagulation therapy has been reported to often be inadequate . Previous retrospective investigations suggest that patients ' self-adjustment of oral anticoagulants may lead to improved control . OBJECTIVE To investigate the effects of patients ' self-management of oral anticoagulation therapy on accuracy of control and measures of treatment-related quality of life . DESIGN R and omized , single-blind , multicenter trial . SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS A total of 179 patients receiving long-term oral anticoagulation treatment were enrolled at 5 referral centers in Germany . The control group received conventional care as provided by family physicians , including referral to specialists if necessary . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Deviation of INR values from the individual INR target range ( squared ) and the 5 categories of treatment-related quality of life . Also , the intervention group had INR values within the target range more often ( repeated measurement analysis for categorical data , P=.006 ) . Treatment-related quality -of-life measures , especially treatment satisfaction scores , were significantly higher in the intervention group compared with controls . Further studies are needed to describe whether the program will reduce risk of bleeding or thromboembolism. ABSTRACT  Fifty-four patients with type II diabetes mellitus , not treated with insulin , who had inadequate glucose control on diet aloneor diet and oral hypoglycemic agents were studied . Patients performed SMBG or urine glucose testing as part of a st and ardized treatment program that also included diet and exercise counseling . Seventeen ( 31 % ) of54 patients actually normalized their glycosylated hemoglobin values , 9 in the urine-testing group and 8 in the SMBG group . Comparisons between the urine-testing and SMBG groups showed no significant differences in mean fasting plasma glucose ( P > 0.86 ) , glycosylated hemoglobin ( P > 0.95 ) , or weight ( P < 0.19 ) . In patients with type II diabetes mellitus not treated with insulin , SMBG is no more effective , but is 8\\u201312 times more expensive , thanurine testing in facilitating improved glycemic control . Our results do not support widespread use of SMBG in diabetic patients not treated with insulin. ABSTRACT  Small portable devices have enabled patient self-monitoring of anticoagulation and self-adjustment of the dose . Patients were self-managed or were managed by the anticoagulation clinic for a period of 3 months . After this period the alternative strategy was followed for each patient . The primary endpoint was the number of measurements within the therapeutic range ( therapeutic target value + /-50.5 INR units ) . FINDINGS There was no significant difference in the overall quality of control of anticoagulation between the two study periods . The proportion of patients who spent most time in the therapeutic target range was larger during self-management than during anticoagulation clinic-guided management . A patient-satisfaction assessment showed superiority of self-management over conventional care . It is also better appreciated by patients . Larger studies are required to assess the effect of this novel management strategy on the incidence of thromboembolic or bleeding complications. ABSTRACT  OBJECTIVE To compare the effect of SM with physician-management ( PM ) on the maintenance of therapeutic anticoagulation . METHODS A r and omized , open-label eight-month trial was performed . Exclusion criteria were a known hypercoaguable disorder , mental incompetence , a language barrier or an inability to attend training sessions . Patients r and omly assigned to PM received usual care from their general practitioner . The primary outcome was to demonstrate 20 % improvement in anticoagulation control by SM . RESULTS One hundred forty patients were r and omly assigned ( 70 per group ) . Thirteen patients dropped out of SM early due to an inability to self-manage . Patients managing their own therapy spent less time below the therapeutic range ( 15.0 % versus 27.3 % , P=0.04 ) . There were three major complications of thrombosis or bleeding , all occurring in the PM arm . All patients who completed SM preferred to continue with that strategy . CONCLUSIONS SM was not significantly better than PM in maintaining therapeutic anticoagulation . SM was feasible and appeared safe in the present study population. ABSTRACT  A diabetes protocol characterized by self-monitoring of blood glucose was introduced in four general practice s with the aim of making the frequency of consultations dependent on the metabolic regulation and emphasizing body weight reduction . The feasibility of the programme was investigated and the results after 1 year were compared with those of conventional care in four control practice s. In the experimental practice s , 13 patients switched from a medical specialist 's to a general practitioner 's supervision  , 20 remained under supervision of their GP  and 33 started self-monitoring . The self-monitoring rate , the consultation frequency according to protocol , the low number of dropouts and inadequate referrals and adherence to the therapeutic scheme showed that the protocol was feasible for both the GPs and the patients . At the initial assessment , the regulation of the diabetes was worse in patients of the experimental group , compared with those of the control group ( mean HbA1 9.7 % vs 8.9 % ; p less than 0.05 ) . On average , patients in the experimental group ( n = 56 ) lost 0.4 kg of body weight , whereas those in the control group ( n = 73 ) gained 0.1 kg ( n.s . ) The mean change in HbA1 , adjusted for the initial value , was -0.4 % in the experimental and + 0.5 % in the control group ( p less than 0.05 ) . The results of the protocol can be attributed to a combination of greater participation of the patient , the individualized consultation frequency and the prescription of oral hypoglycaemic agents according to body weight development. ABSTRACT  Self-monitoring of blood glucose levels is currently being recommended for obese patients with type II diabetes to improve weight loss and glycemic control . Both groups lost significant amounts of weight and maintained their losses for at least one year ; reductions in medication could be made for 70 percent of patients . These data suggest that the behavioral weight control used in this study may be of benefit to patients with type II diabetes . However , there was no evidence that the addition of self-monitoring of blood glucose levels to the treatment program improved the outcome in terms of weight loss , reduction in medication , dietary compliance , or mood state. ABSTRACT  Two thous and patients suitable for self-management will be assigned at r and om to either the self-management group or the control group . The numbers of thromboembolic and hemorrhagic complications requiring treatment during the 2-year follow-up period will be recorded as the primary end point . The secondary endpoint variables will be maintenance of the INR value in the individual target range , INR variance , the course of complications over time , and the cost efficiency of self-management compared with the routine procedures . The last of these parameters will include the diagnostic and /or therapeutic measures carried out , the duration of inpatient hospital treatment , and the social consequences ( subsequent rehabilitation treatment , inability to work , forced retirement ) . Since this rate can be halved by self-management , a one-tailed chi 2-test of 80 % power and a 5 % significance threshold would require n = 997 patients per group . The results of the SMAAF study will establish the socioeconomic benefits of self-management in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. ABSTRACT  RESULTS Almost 80 % of the INR values recorded by patients at home were within the stipulated therapeutic range , INR 2.5 to 4.5 , compared with just 62 % of INR values recorded by family practitioners . The overall complication rate ( hemorrhages and thromboembolic events ) of the self-management group was significantly ( p < 0.05 ) decreased compared with the conventional group . CONCLUSIONS Through INR self-management , an improvement in the quality of ongoing oral anticoagulation could be shown . Starting this form of therapeutic control early after mechanical heart valve replacement appears to effect a further reduction in anticoagulant-induced complications. ABSTRACT  BACKGROUND Several studies have demonstrated that patient self-management of oral anticoagulant therapy ( OAT )  can improve treatment quality . However , most of these studies were not conducted within a specialized anticoagulation care system . The objective of the present study was to determine whether patient self-management of OAT improves the quality of care delivered by anticoagulation clinics . RESULTS Only 25.6 % of invited patients agreed to participate in the training program . Patients who remained in the existing care group were within the international normalized ratio target range 63.5 % of the time . The type of coumarin taken was a major predicting factor of OAT quality . In all study groups phenprocoumon outperformed acenocoumarol by 11.6 % ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 6.6%-16.5 % ) . Weekly management with acenocoumarol did not improve the quality of OAT . CONCLUSION With selected patients , the quality of OAT obtained through patient self-management is at least as high as that delivered by specialized physicians at anticoagulation clinics . Weekly management of OAT with long-acting phenprocoumon has to be preferred at anticoagulation clinics or , where possible , through patient self-management. ABSTRACT  At the end of the study period , the decrease of HbA1c over six months -- main endpoint -- was not significantly different between the three groups ( mean + /- SEM ; group A : -0.5 + /- 0.2 % ; group B : -0.1 + /- 0.3 % ; group C : -0.4 + /- 0.3 % ) . However , the degree of compliance to  blood glucose self-monitoring  in group C appeared to relate to the outcome : a significant correlation was found between the number of blood glucose strips used and the decrease of HbA1c ( r = .36 , p less than .02 ) . We conclude that regular self-monitoring has no definite advantage over the usual management for improving metabolic control in non-insulin-treated diabetic patients , though it may possibly help patients ready to comply with its use. ABSTRACT  Baseline hemoglobin HbA 1c ranged between 9.5 % and 13.5 % ( normal range 5.5%\\u20137.7 % ) . Subjects were matched for weight , sex , and HbAlc and assigned to small ( 4\\u20138 participants ) groups which met weekly for 12 weeks and then monthly for 16 weeks . After 8 weeks , the group were r and omized either to continue the behavioral program or to have SMBG and dietary CHO counting . Weight loss was identical in both groups during the year of follow-up . The HbA1c level showed a progressive decline in experimental subjects ( P<0.05 ) , whereas there was no improvement in control subjects. ABSTRACT  Design Multicentre open r and omised controlled trial . Setting Midl and s region of the UK . Main outcome measure Percentage of time spent within the therapeutic range of international normalised ratio . Self managed patients with poor control before the study showed an improvement in control that was not seen in the routine care group . It may improve the time spent the therapeutic range for patients with initially poor control . Trial registration IS RCT N 19313375. ABSTRACT  This study tested the hypothesis that follow-up intervention ( by telephone calls and home visit ) affects compliance in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus ( NIDDM ) . No significant differences were seen in post study HbA 1c values and weight changes between the two groups . Follow-up inter vention by telephone calls and home visit can enhance patient compliance to certain aspects of the prescribed diabetes management plan. ABSTRACT  STUDY OBJECTIVE To evaluate the efficacy and accuracy of monitoring prothrombin times at home . DESIGN R and omized , prospect i ve cohort study . SETTING Out patients discharged from a university hospital or a community hospital . There were no major thromboembolic or hemorrhagic complications in either group . CONCLUSIONS Use of a portable prothrombin time monitor by patients at home is feasible and provides accurate measurements . Patients doing home monitoring achieve superior anticoagulation control compared with those receiving st and ard anticoagulation clinic care. ABSTRACT  Context Although many out patients require oral anticoagulation , the optimal management of outpatient anticoagulation remains uncertain . The Editors Indications for oral anticoagulant treatment to prevent thromboembolic disease have increased in recent years ( 1 ) . The establishment of accurate therapeutic INR ranges was also beneficial . Target ranges include the safest INR values that carry the lowest risk for hemorrhagic or thromboembolic complications ( 2 ) . Currently , portable coagulometers are available for determining INR easily and reliably ( 8) . This technology provides interesting clinical models for the control of oral anticoagulant treatment , the most promising of which are patient self-testing and patient self-management . For patient self-testing , patients measure INRs themselves and ask their referring physicians for the proper anticoagulant dose . Patient self-management assumes that patients will adjust their own doses and is the most autonomous strategy . The clinical staff includes trained nurses . Computers control the clinical data and INR records , ensuring excellent follow-up . Samsa and Matchar ( 20 ) recommended that these characteristics be used to provide an appropriate control group in a trial on patient self-management . The institutional review board of our hospital approved the study . Once the patient ( or his or her caregiver ) agreed to participate , written informed consent was obtained . Next , central ized telephone r and omization assigned the patient to the experimental group ( patient self-management ) or to the control group ( conventional management ) . The allocation sequence was generated at the hospital 's epidemiology department , and the sequence of r and omization was concealed until the patient was assigned to a group . Members of our anticoagulation clinic enrolled participants and assigned them to groups . Follow-up for patients assigned to the conventional management group was done immediately . The program consisted of 2 sessions of 2 hours each on consecutive days . A specially trained nurse was responsible for teaching the patients in small , organized groups . The lessons included basic theoretical and practical concepts involving the use of a coagulometer , interpretation of INR , and adjustment of dose . The concepts of target range and dose modification were emphasized when necessary . A simple card system was design ed to help the patient select the correct dose . For each target range , a specific card was provided . Patients were taught to use the portable coagulometer CoaguChek S ( Roche Diagnostics , Mannheim , Germany ) with the appropriate reagent strips . When the INR result was out of target range , our dosing protocol indicated that we should advance the next appointment for INR testing to 1 or 2 weeks . International normalized ratio was determined by means of a st and ard KC 10 coagulometer ( Amelung , Lemgo , Germany ) . As a thromboplastin , we used Thromborel S ( Behring , Marburg , Germany ) . A hematologist experienced in oral anticoagulation management adjusted the dose and made the appointment for the next INR test . Patients in the self-management group performed the INR tests at home once per week using the CoaguChek S kit . They determined the appropriate dose of oral anticoagulant and the time of the next INR test . All of the INR results in both groups were entered into a computer ( in the central system of our anticoagulation clinic or in the portable coagulometers ) to facilitate data management . Patients in both groups were interviewed monthly by telephone to record any complications or changes in their health status . For the conventional management group , these interviews were done approximately midway between hospital visits . The questions addressed minor or major bleeding , thromboembolic events , episodic diseases , changes in long-term medications , and hospital stays . Associated complications were diagnosed and evaluated by a third physician who was not involved in the trial and was unaware of patients ' study group . St and ard criteria were used to diagnose any thromboembolic complications . Transient ischemic attack was diagnosed clinical ly by a neurologist , and superficial thrombophlebitis was diagnosed clinical ly by an angiologist . All thromboembolic complications were considered major events . Life-threatening bleeding or bleeding requiring transfusion or hospital admission was considered a major event . Any other bleeding was considered a minor event . Statistical Analysis Study outcomes were evaluated on an intention-to-treat basis and also on an on-treatment basis .. ABSTRACT  Of these , 44 were r and omized to self\\u2010monitor their INR and 41 returned to clinic . Inter\\u2010group differences were not statistically significant ( intervention groups 0\\u00b726 \\u00b1 0\\u00b730 vs. control 0\\u00b716 \\u00b1 0\\u00b73 , P = 0\\u00b710 ) . Quality \\u2010of\\u2010life measurements and health beliefs about warfarin were unchanged ( apart from emotional role limitation ) with education or education and self\\u2010monitoring . Patient  education regarding anticoagulation therapy could be a cost\\u2010effective initiative and is worthy of further study. ABSTRACT  BACKGROUND This study was conducted to assess the ability of patients receiving heart valve replacements to practice self-managed anticoagulation using a portable coagulometer . METHODS We carried out a prospect i ve , r and omized trial , comparing self-managed anticoagulation with conventional management . There was no significant difference in mortality or morbidity between the two groups . CONCLUSIONS Self-managed anticoagulation is a reliable , easily learned method of controlling anticoagulation , and it is suitable for approximately two thirds of patients , with excellent results. ABSTRACT  Bleeding is the major side effect of warfarin and is a major deterrent to its use , especially in older patients . However , there is little controlled or experimental evidence on how to optimize management of anticoagulant therapy in older patients and prevent bleeding . Eligible patients who were enrolled did not differ significantly from those who were not enrolled with regard to age , ethnicity , sex , or indication for therapy . Figure 1 . Eligibility and r and om assignment of patients . Patients were stratified according to their baseline risk for major bleeding by using the Outpatient Bleeding Risk Index ( 20 ) . After stratification , patients were r and omly assigned to receive usual care or intervention . Informed consent for observation and data collection was then sought from both groups , and informed consent to participate in the intervention was sought from the intervention group . The sample size was calculated to provide 80 % power and an level of 0.05 . The study protocol and informed consent procedures were approved by the hospital 's institutional review board . Intervention The intervention had two main components . The first component consisted of a guideline -based consultation that assessed the patient 's indications for therapy and potential risk factors for warfarin-related bleeding . We used this method previously to reduce the frequency of anticoagulant-related bleeding  during hospitalization ( 27 ) . Specific recommendations about modifiable risk factors , such as use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs , were made and implemented . The study investigators directed warfarin dosing and international normalized ratio ( INR ) testing after hospital discharge . The lay educator review ed the workbook and was taught how to use the prothrombin time monitor by one of the authors but had no formal medical training . Coaching was aim ed to increase patients ' participation in their care and to improve information-seeking skills . The monitor uses a fingerstick to obtain a blood sample and has well-established accuracy ( 36 - 38 ) . Patients were initially assessed , educated , and taught to use the portable monitor while hospitalized ; training lasted 30 minutes to 1 hour . They were seen daily while hospitalized , warfarin therapy was adjusted as needed , and any concerns or questions about anticoagulant therapy were addressed . After the 6-month intervention period , management and dosing of warfarin therapy reverted back to patients ' personal physicians . Surveillance for bleeding and thromboembolism was conducted identically in the intervention and control groups and consisted of 12 items inquiring about bleeding and thromboembolism at each follow-up interview . All date s of death were confirmed by death certificates , and all causes of death were confirmed by review of death certificates and medical records . Follow-up was complete for all patients . End Points The primary end point was the first major bleeding event during the 6-month intervention period . Bleeding was classified without information about possible risk factors or r and omization status . Two author- review ers who were blinded to group assignment adjudicated bleeding events ; their agreement was high ( statistic , 0.97 ) . The therapeutic range of the INR was defined as 2.5 to 3.5 for persons with mechanical heart valves and 2.0 to 3.0 for persons with all other indications ( 40 ) . This approach estimates the amount of time a patient is in the therapeutic range based on the actual INRs measured , assuming a linear relationship between consecutive INRs . Patients with only one. ABSTRACT  An ageing population and the continuing expansion of clinical indications for coumadin therapy have increased pressure on hospital anticoagulant clinics . One solution is patient self\\u2010testing ( PST ) of the international normalized ratio ( INR ) using capillary blood sample s on point\\u2010of\\u2010care coagulation monitors at home . We conducted a prospect i ve study to determine whether patients can achieve accurate INR values through PST , using the CoaguChek S ( Roche Diagnostics , Lewes , UK ) . The main outcome measurements were : comparability of INR values obtained by PST and the hospital laboratory , patient acceptability as assessed by a question naire and anticoagulant control . Patients were r and omized to weekly self\\u2010testing or continuing 4\\u2010weekly hospital laboratory monitoring of INR . Comparison of INRs ( n = 234 ) showed no significant differences between the CoaguChek ( median INR 3\\u00b702 ) and laboratory testing ( median INR 3\\u00b707 ) . There was excellent correlation between the two methods ( r = 0\\u00b795 ) , with 85 % of CoaguChek results within 0\\u00b75 INR units of the laboratory method . On four occasions , differences of > 1 unit INR were obtained , but in each case the patient 's anticoagulation was unstable ( INR > 4\\u00b75 by both methods ) and the differences in INR would not have altered patient management . 87 % of patients found self\\u2010testing straightforward , 87 % were confident in the result they obtained and 77 % preferred self\\u2010testing . We conclude that PST is a reliable alternative to hospital clinic attendance and is acceptable to the majority of suitably trained patients\",\n          \" BACKGROUND Actinic keratosis is a common precursor to sun-related squamous-cell carcinoma . Treating actinic keratoses and the surrounding skin area ( i.e. , field therapy ) can eradicate clinical and sub clinical actinic keratoses . Topical field therapy currently requires weeks or months of treatment . Complete clearance ( primary outcome ) was assessed at 57 days , and local reactions were quantitatively measured . Adverse events were generally mild to moderate in intensity and resolved without sequelae . CONCLUSIONS Ingenol mebutate gel applied topically for 2 to 3 days is effective for field treatment of actinic keratoses .

ABSTRACT  BACKGROUND In r and omized trials , fecal occult-blood testing reduces mortality from colorectal cancer . However , the duration of the benefit is unknown , as are the effects specific to age and sex . Screening was performed from 1976 through 1982 and from 1986 through 1992 . We used the National Death Index to obtain up date d information on the vital status of participants and to determine causes of death through 2008 . RESULTS Through 30 years of follow-up , 33,020 participants ( 70.9 % ) died . The reduction in colorectal-cancer mortality was larger for men than for women in the biennial-screening group ( P=0.04 for interaction ) . CONCLUSIONS The effect of screening with fecal occult-blood testing on colorectal-cancer mortality persists after 30 years but does not influence all-cause mortality . The sustained reduction in colorectal-cancer mortality supports the effect of polypectomy . ( Funded by the Veterans Affairs Merit Review Award Program and others . ). ABSTRACT  BACKGROUND Women 's groups and health education by peer counsellors can improve the health of mothers and children . We assessed their effects on mortality and breastfeeding rates  in rural Malawi . METHODS We did a 2 \\u00d7 2 factorial , cluster-r and omised trial in 185,888 people in Mchinji district . 48 equal-sized clusters were r and omly allocated to four groups with a computer-generated number sequence . 24 facilitators guided groups through a community action cycle to tackle maternal and child health problems . Analysis was by intention to treat . The trial is registered as IS RCT N06477126 . FINDINGS We monitored outcomes of 26,262 births between 2005 and 2009 .

ABSTRACT  BACKGROUND Venous thromboembolism is a common , potentially avoidable cause of death and morbidity in patients in hospital , including those with stroke . We assessed the effectiveness of IPC to reduce the risk of DVT in patients who have had a stroke . Caregivers and patients were not masked to treatment assignment . Patients were followed up for 6 months to determine survival and later symptomatic venous thromboembolism . Patients were analysed according to their treatment allocation . TRIAL REGISTRATION IS RCT N93529999 . FINDINGS Between Dec 8 , 2008 , and Sept 6 , 2012 , 2876 patients were enrolled in 94 centres in the UK . The included patients were broadly representative of immobile stroke patients admitted to hospital and had a median age of 76 years ( IQR 67 - 84 ) . INTERPRETATION IPC is an effective method of reducing the risk of DVT and possibly improving survival in a wide variety of patients who are immobile after stroke .. ABSTRACT  BACKGROUND We previously reported that integrating antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) with tuberculosis treatment reduces mortality . However , the timing for the initiation of ART during tuberculosis treatment remains unresolved . Findings in the earlier-ART group ( ART initiated within 4 weeks after the start of tuberculosis treatment ,  214 patients ) and later-ART group ( ART initiated during the first 4 weeks of the continuation phase of tuberculosis treatment ,  215 patients ) are presented here . RESULTS At baseline , the median CD4 + T-cell count was 150 per cubic millimeter , and the median viral load was 161,000 copies per milliliter , with no significant differences between the two groups . The incidence rates of the immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome ( IRIS ) were 20.1 and 7.7 cases per 100 person-years , respectively ( incidence-rate ratio , 2.62 ; 95 % CI , 1.48 to 4.82 ; P<0.001 ) . Adverse events requiring a switching of antiretroviral drugs occurred in 10 patients in the earlier-ART group and 1 patient in the later-ART group ( P=0.006 ) . CONCLUSIONS Early initiation of ART in patients with CD4 + T-cell counts of less than 50 per cubic millimeter increased AIDS-free survival .

ABSTRACT  BACKGROUND Early termination of prolonged seizures with intravenous administration of benzodiazepines improves outcomes . For faster and more reliable administration , paramedics increasingly use an intramuscular route . The primary outcome was absence of seizures at the time of arrival in the emergency department without the need for rescue therapy . Secondary outcomes included endotracheal intubation , recurrent seizures , and timing of treatment relative to the cessation of convulsive seizures . This trial tested the hypothesis that intramuscular midazolam was noninferior to intravenous lorazepam by a margin of 10 percentage points . Adverse-event rates were similar in the two groups . CONCLUSIONS For subjects in status epilepticus , intramuscular midazolam is at least as safe and effective as intravenous lorazepam for prehospital seizure cessation .

ABSTRACT  Interventions to reduce preterm birth in these women have not been successful . We assessed whether a cervical pessary could effectively prevent poor perinatal outcomes . Participants and investigators were aware of group allocation . For women in the pessary group , a midwife or obstetrician inserted a cervical pessary between 16 and 20 weeks ' gestation . Women in the control group did not receive the pessary , but otherwise received similar obstetrical care to those in the pessary group . Analyses were by modified intention to treat .

ABSTRACT  We assessed outcomes from the TRILOGY ACS trial based on whether or not patients had coronary angiography before treatment was chosen . METHODS TRILOGY ACS ( Clinical Trials.gov number NCT00699998 ) was a r and omised controlled trial , done at more than 800 sites worldwide . Patients with non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome who were selected for management without [ corrected ] revascularisation were r and omly assigned to clopidogrel or prasugrel . The primary endpoint was cardiovascular death , myocardial infa rct ion , or stroke at 30 months . In the present analysis we assessed differences in the primary endpoint by angiography status and whether the effects of treatment on the primary endpoint differed between patients who had angiography before enrolment and those who had not . FINDINGS 7243 patients younger than 75 years were included in the TRILOGY ACS primary analysis . 3085 ( 43 % ) had angiography at baseline , 4158 ( 57 % ) had not . Overall , TIMI major bleeding and GUSTO severe bleeding were rare . Bleeding outcomes tended to be higher with prasugrel but did not differ significantly between treatment groups in either angiography cohort . This result needs to be corroborated , but it is consistent with previous trials of more versus less intensive antiplatelet treatment . FUNDING Daiichi Sankyo , Eli Lilly. ABSTRACT  After the failure of torcetrapib it was unknown if HDL produced by interaction with CETP had pro-atherogenic or pro-inflammatory properties . R and omisation was done with a computer-generated r and omisation code and was stratified by centre . Patients and investigators were masked to treatment . Analysis was by intention to treat . This trial is registered at Clinical Trials.gov , NCT00655473 . Dalcetrapib did not increase office blood pressure and the frequency of adverse events was similar between groups .

ABSTRACT  We conducted a phase 3 study of the efficacy and safety of the combination versus gemcitabine monotherapy in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer . Patients received the study treatment until disease progression . The primary end point was overall survival ; secondary end points were progression-free survival and overall response rate . RESULTS A total of 861 patients were r and omly assigned to nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine ( 431 patients ) or gemcitabine  ( 430 ) . The survival rate was 35 % in the nab-paclitaxel-gemcitabine group versus 22 % in the gemcitabine group at 1 year , and 9 % versus 4 % at 2 years . Febrile neutropenia occurred in 3 % versus 1 % of the patients in the two groups . In the nab-paclitaxel-gemcitabine group , neuropathy of grade 3 or higher improved to grade 1 or lower in a median of 29 days . ( Funded by Celgene ; Clinical Trials.gov number , NCT00844649 . ). ABSTRACT  OBJECTIVES Gender and ethnicity are factors affecting the incidence and severity of vascular disease as well as subsequent treatment outcomes . This study describes the reporting of gender and ethnicity data in vascular surgery RCTs and analyzes whether these studies adequately represent our diverse patient population . Included studies were examined for gender and ethnicity data , study parameters , funding source , and geographic region . The Nationwide Inpatient Sample ( NIS ) data base was analyzed to obtain group-specific procedure frequency as an estimate of procedure frequency in the general population . RESULTS We review ed 77 studies , and 52 met our inclusion criteria . Only 85 % reported gender , and 21 % reported ethnicity . Reporting of ethnicity was strongly associated with larger ( > 280 participants ) , multicenter , government-funded trials ( P < .001 for all ) . CONCLUSIONS Minority ethnicity and female gender are under-reported and under-represented in vascular surgery RCTs , particularly in small , non-government-funded and single-center trials . The generalizability of some trial results may not be applicable to these population s. Greater effort to enroll a balanced study population in RCTs may yield more broadly applicable results. ABSTRACT  BACKGROUND Arthroscopic partial meniscectomy is one of the most common orthopedic procedures , yet rigorous evidence of its efficacy is lacking . Patients were r and omly assigned to arthroscopic partial meniscectomy or sham surgery . RESULTS In the intention-to-treat analysis , there were no significant between-group differences in the change from baseline to 12 months in any primary outcome . CONCLUSIONS In this trial involving patients without knee osteoarthritis but with symptoms of a degenerative medial meniscus tear , the outcomes after arthroscopic partial meniscectomy were no better than those after a sham surgical procedure .

ABSTRACT  BACKGROUND Bevacizumab has been suggested to have similar effectiveness to ranibizumab for treatment of neovascular age-related macular degeneration . Here , we report the findings at the prespecified 2-year timepoint . Study participants and clinical assessors were masked to drug allocation . Allocation to continuous or discontinuous treatment was masked up to 3 months , at which point investigators and participants were unmasked . The primary outcome was BCVA at 2 years , with a prespecified non-inferiority limit of 3\\u00b75 letters . The primary safety outcome was arterial thrombotic event or hospital admission for heart failure . Analyses were by modified intention to treat . This trial is registered , number IS RCT N92166560 . FINDINGS Between March 27 , 2008 , and Oct 15 , 2010 , 628 patients underwent r and omisation . 18 were withdrawn ; 610 received study drugs ( 314 ranibizumab ; 296 bevacizumab ) and were included in analyses . Discontinuous treatment was neither non-inferior nor inferior to continuous treatment ( -1\\u00b763 letters , -4\\u00b701 to 0\\u00b775 ; p=0\\u00b718 ) . INTERPRETATION Ranibizumab and bevacizumab have similar efficacy . Reduction in the frequency of retreatment result ed in a small loss of efficacy irrespective of drug . Safety was worse when treatment was administered discontinuously . These findings highlight that the choice of anti-VEGF treatment strategy is less straightforward than previously thought .

The overall rate of ascertainment of RAS status was 90 % . A total of 108 patients ( 17 % ) with nonmutated KRAS exon 2 had other RAS mutations . BRAF mutations were a negative prognostic factor . No new safety signals were identified . CONCLUSIONS Additional RAS mutations predicted a lack of response in patients who received panitumumab-FOLFOX4 . In patients who had metastatic colorectal cancer without RAS mutations , improvements in overall survival were observed with panitumumab-FOLFOX4 therapy .

The primary endpoint was first cardiovascular event , including cardiovascular mortality and morbidity , revascularisation , and non-traumatic amputation within 5 years . Patients and staff assessing outcomes were unaware of the practice 's study group assignment . Analysis was done by intention to treat . This study is registered with Clinical Trials.gov , number NCT00237549 . Findings Primary endpoint data were available for 3055 ( 99\\u00b79 % ) of 3057 screen-detected patients . The mean age was 60\\u00b73 ( SD 6\\u00b79 ) years and the mean duration of follow-up was 5\\u00b73 ( SD 1\\u00b76 ) years . Improvements in cardiovascular risk factors ( HbA1c and cholesterol concentrations and blood pressure ) were slightly but significantly better in the intensive treatment group .. ABSTRACT  The primary end point was length of stay in the hospital . Secondary end points included rates of discharge from the emergency department , major adverse cardiovascular events at 28 days , and cumulative costs . Safety end points were undetected acute coronary syndromes . RESULTS The rate of acute coronary syndromes  among 1000 patients with a mean ( \\u00b1SD ) age of 54\\u00b18 years ( 47 % women ) was 8 % . There were no undetected acute coronary syndromes and no significant differences in major adverse cardiovascular events at 28 days . After CCTA , there was more downstream testing and higher radiation exposure . The cumulative mean cost of care was similar in the CCTA group and the st and ard-evaluation group ( $ 4,289 and $ 4,060 , respectively ; P=0.65 ) .

ABSTRACT  BACKGROUND Catheter-associated urinary tract infection ( CAUTI ) is a major preventable cause of harm for patients in hospital . Patients undergoing unplanned catheterisation were also included and consent for participation was obtained retrospectively . Participants and trial staff were unmasked to treatment assignment . Data were collected by trial staff and by patient-reported question naires for 6 weeks after r and omisation . The primary outcome was incidence of symptomatic urinary tract infection for which an antibiotic was prescribed by 6 weeks . This study is registered , number IS RCT N75198618 . Rates of catheter-related discomfort were higher in the nitrofural group than they were in the other groups . INTERPRETATION Silver alloy-coated catheters were not effective for reduction of incidence of symptomatic CAUTI .

ABSTRACT  BACKGROUND The higher prevalence and cost of depression for women compared with men and the possible gender differences in treatment response dem and the inclusion of women in clinical trials of depression treatments . The purpose of this study is to examine the inclusion of women and gender-specific analyses in recent r and omized clinical trials ( RCTs ) for depression . METHODS RCTs were identified through a MEDLINE search for trials published between January 1 and December 31 , 2007 , and a Clinical trials.gov search of self-identified interventional studies to treat depression . RESULTS Of the 150 RCTs for depression published in 2007 , 15 % did not report the gender composition of their sample , 50 % of studies did not analyze outcomes by gender , and 12 % controlled for gender but did not analyze for gender differences . Of the 768 trials review ed on Clinical trials.gov , 89 % reported recruiting male and female participants , yet < 1 % reported an intention to analyze results by gender . CONCLUSIONS Many recent studies of depression treatments include women but do not examine outcomes by gender . Underst and ing how women differ from men in response to treatment is critical for enhancing treatment efficacy for the greatest number of adults with depression. ABSTRACT  BACKGROUND In trachoma control programmes , azithromycin is distributed to treat the strains of chlamydia that cause ocular disease . We aim ed to compare the effect of annual versus twice-yearly distribution of azithromycin on infection with these strains . R and om assignment was done with the R AND OM and SORT functions of Microsoft Excel . All individuals were offered their assigned treatment of a single , directly observed , oral dose of azithromycin . Our analysis was by intention to treat . This study is registered with Clinical Trials.gov , number NCT00322972 . INTERPRETATION After 42 months of treatment , the prevalence of ocular infection with chlamydia was similar in the groups treated annually and twice yearly . However , elimination of infection might have been more rapid in the groups of villages that received treatment twice yearly . FUNDING National Institutes of Health ( NEI U10 EY016214 ). ABSTRACT  BACKGROUND Atherosclerotic renal-artery stenosis is a common problem in the elderly . Despite two r and omized trials that did not show a benefit of renal-artery stenting with respect to kidney function , the usefulness of stenting for the prevention of major adverse renal and cardiovascular events is uncertain . There were also no significant differences between the treatment groups in the rates of the individual components of the primary end point or in all-cause mortality . During follow-up , there was a consistent modest difference in systolic blood pressure favoring the stent group ( -2.3 mm Hg ; 95 % CI , -4.4 to -0.2 ; P=0.03 ) .

ABSTRACT  BACKGROUND Powders containing iron and other micronutrients are recommended as a strategy to prevent nutritional anaemia and other micronutrient deficiencies in children . We assessed the effects of provision of two micronutrient powder formulations , with or without zinc , to children in Pakistan . METHODS We did a cluster r and omised trial in urban and rural sites in Sindh , Pakistan . Children in the clusters aged 6 months were eligible for inclusion in the study . Powders were to be given daily between 6 and 18 months of age ; follow-up was to age 2 years . Parents knew whether their child was receiving supplementation , but did not know whether the powder contained zinc . Primary outcomes were growth , episodes of diarrhoea , acute lower respiratory tract infection , fever , and incidence of admission to hospital . This trial is registered with Clinical Trials.gov , number NCT00705445 . RESULTS The trial was done between Nov 1 , 2008 , and Dec 31 , 2011 . 947 children were enrolled in group A clusters , 910 in group B clusters , and 889 in group C clusters . Incidence of febrile episodes or admission to hospital for diarrhoea , respiratory problems , or febrile episodes did not differ between the three groups .

ABSTRACT  Patients ( age range , 16 to 80 years ) had tumor stage T1 to T3 , with possible spread to nearby lymph nodes but without metastasis . End points were the rate of success of ablation at 6 to 9 months , adverse events , quality of life , and length of hospital stay . RESULTS A total of 438 patients underwent r and omization ; data could be analyzed for 421 . All 95 % confidence intervals for the differences were within \\u00b110 percentage points , indicating noninferiority . Similar results were found for low-dose radioiodine plus thyrotropin alfa ( 84.3 % ) versus high-dose radioiodine plus thyroid hormone withdrawal ( 87.6 % ) or high-dose radioiodine plus thyrotropin alfa ( 90.2 % ) . More patients in the high-dose group than in the low-dose group were hospitalized for at least 3 days ( 36.3 % vs. 13.0 % , P<0.001 ) . CONCLUSIONS Low-dose radioiodine plus thyrotropin alfa was as effective as high-dose radioiodine , with a lower rate of adverse events .

ABSTRACT  BACKGROUND Prospect i ve assessment of pharmacogenetic strategies has been limited by an inability to undertake bedside genetic testing . Individuals in the rapid genotyping group were screened for the CYP2C19 * 2 allele . Interventional cardiologists and data analysts were masked to genetic status and treatment . Patients were not masked to treatment allocation . All analyses were by intention to treat . This study is registered with Clinical Trials.gov , NCT01184300 . 23 individuals in each group carried at least one CYP2C19 * 2 allele . FUNDING Spartan Biosciences. ABSTRACT  BACKGROUND Autologous fat grafting is increasingly used in reconstructive surgery . However , resorption rates ranging from 25 % to 80 % have been reported . Therefore , methods to increase graft viability are needed . Two purified fat grafts ( 30 mL each ) taken from the second liposuction were prepared for each participant . The primary goal was to compare the residual graft volumes of ASC-enriched grafts with those of control grafts . This study is registered at www . clinical trialsregister.eu , number 2010 - 023006 - 12 . FINDINGS 13 participants were enrolled , three of whom were excluded . No serious adverse events were noted . INTERPRETATION The procedure of ASC-enriched fat grafting  had excellent feasibility and safety .

ABSTRACT  Dolutegravir , in combination with abacavir-lamivudine , may provide a simplified regimen . The primary end point was the proportion of participants with an HIV-1 RNA level of less than 50 copies per milliliter at week 48 . Secondary end points included the time to viral suppression , the change from baseline in CD4 + T-cell count , safety , and viral resistance . RESULTS A total of 833 participants received at least one dose of study drug . No participants in the DTG-ABC-3TC group had detectable antiviral resistance ; one tenofovir DF-associated mutation and four efavirenz-associated mutations were detected in participants with virologic failure in the EFV-TDF-FTC group . CONCLUSIONS Dolutegravir plus abacavir-lamivudine had a better safety profile and was more effective through 48 weeks than the regimen with efavirenz-tenofovir DF-emtricitabine .

Studies where individuals were not the unit of analysis , those begun before 1994 , and those not receiving federal funding were excluded . PubMed search located 512 published articles . After exclusion of ineligible articles , 86 ( 17 % ) remained for analysis . RESULTS Thirty studies were sex specific . The  median enrollment of women in the 56 studies that included both men and women was 37 % . Seventy-five percent of the studies did not report any outcomes by sex , including 9 studies reporting < 20 % women enrolled . Only 3 studies indicated that the generalizability of their results may be limited by lack of diversity among those studied . There were no statistically significant changes in inclusion or reporting of sex or race/ethnicity when compared with 2004 .. ABSTRACT  BACKGROUND Maintenance therapy , often with azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil , is required to consoli date remission and prevent relapse after the initial control of lupus nephritis . The study group underwent repeat r and omization in a 1:1 ratio . Up to 10 mg of prednisone per day or its equivalent was permitted . Secondary assessment s included the time to the individual components of treatment failure and adverse events . RESULTS A total of 227 patients were r and omly assigned to maintenance treatment ( 116 to mycophenolate mofetil and 111 to azathioprine ) . Observed rates of treatment failure were 16.4 % ( 19 of 116 patients ) in the mycophenolate mofetil group and 32.4 % ( 36 of 111 ) in the azathioprine group . Adverse events , most commonly minor infections and gastrointestinal disorders , occurred in more than 95 % of the patients in both groups ( P = 0.68 ) . CONCLUSIONS Mycophenolate mofetil was superior to azathioprine in maintaining a renal response to treatment and in preventing relapse in patients with lupus nephritis who had a response to induction therapy .

ABSTRACT  BACKGROUND Exclusive breastfeeding ( EBF ) is reported to be a life-saving intervention in low-income setting s. The effect of breastfeeding counselling by peer counsellors was assessed in Africa . In the intervention group , we scheduled one antenatal breastfeeding peer counselling visit and four post-delivery visits by trained peers . The data gathering team were masked to the intervention allocation . The primary outcomes were prevalance of EBF and diarrhoea reported by mothers for infants aged 12 weeks and 24 weeks . Country-specific prevalence ratios were adjusted for cluster effects and sites . Analysis was by intention to treat . This study is registered with Clinical Trials.gov , number NCT00397150 .. ABSTRACT  BACKGROUND Bacteraemia is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in critically ill children .

ABSTRACT  BACKGROUND Stroke is common during the first few weeks after a transient ischemic attack ( TIA ) or minor ischemic stroke . Combination therapy with clopidogrel and aspirin may provide greater protection against subsequent stroke than aspirin alone . All participants received open-label aspirin at a clinician-determined dose of 75 to 300 mg on day 1 . The primary outcome was stroke ( ischemic or hemorrhagic ) during 90 days of follow-up in an intention-to-treat analysis . Treatment differences were assessed with the use of a Cox proportional-hazards model , with study center as a r and om effect .

ABSTRACT  In view of the few treatment options and the potential toxicity associated with lifelong ART , in the CHER trial we compared early time-limited ART with deferred ART . The r and omisation schedule was stratified by clinical site with permuted blocks of r and om sizes to balance the numbers of infants allocated to each group . Combination therapy of lopinavir-ritonavir , zidovudine , and lamivudine was the first-line treatment regimen at ART initiation and re-initiation . The primary endpoint was time to failure of first-line ART ( immunological , clinical , or virological ) or death . Comparisons were done by intention-to-treat analysis , with use of time-to-event methods . This trial is registered with Clinical Trials.gov , number NCT00102960 . Median follow-up was 4\\u00b78 years ; 34 infants ( 9 % ) were lost to follow-up . Median time to ART initiation in the ART-Def group was 20 weeks ( IQR 16 - 25 ) . Proportions of follow-up time spent on ART were 81 % in the ART-Def group , 70 % in the ART-40W group , and 69 % in the ART-96W group . Three children in ART-Def , three in ART-40W , and one in ART-96W switched to second-line ART . Longer time on primary ART permits longer subsequent interruption , with marginally better outcomes .

We investigated whether combination therapy with glucocorticoids plus N-acetylcysteine would improve survival . METHODS We r and omly assigned 174 patients to receive prednisolone plus N-acetylcysteine ( 85 patients ) or only prednisolone ( 89 patients ) . All patients received 4 weeks of prednisolone . The prednisolone-only group received an infusion in 1000 ml of 5 % glucose solution per day on days 1 through 5 . The primary outcome was 6-month survival . RESULTS Mortality was not significantly lower in the prednisolone-N-acetylcysteine group than in the prednisolone-only group at 6 months ( 27 % vs. 38 % , P = 0.07 ) . Mortality was significantly lower at 1 month ( 8 % vs. 24 % , P = 0.006 ) but not at 3 months ( 22 % vs. 34 % , P = 0.06 ) . Infections were less frequent in the prednisolone-N-acetylcysteine group than in the prednisolone-only group ( P = 0.001 ) ; other side effects were similar in the two groups .

ABSTRACT  BACKGROUND Most patients who have had a stroke are dependent on informal caregivers for activities of daily living . METHODS We undertook a pragmatic , multicentre , cluster r and omised controlled trial with a parallel cost-effectiveness analysis . Patients with a diagnosis of stroke , likely to return home with residual disability and with a caregiver providing support were eligible . The primary outcome for caregivers was self-reported burden at 6 months , measured with the caregivers burden scale ( CBS ) . We combined patient and caregiver costs with primary outcomes and quality -adjusted life-years ( QALYs ) to assess cost-effectiveness . This trial is registered with controlled-trials.com , number IS RCT N 49208824 . FINDINGS We assessed 49 stroke units for eligibility , of which 36 were r and omly assigned to either the intervention group or the control group . Probabilities of cost-effectiveness based on QALYs were low . INTERPRETATION In a large scale , robust evaluation , results from this study have shown no differences between the LSCTC and usual care on any of the assessed outcomes . The immediate period after stroke might not be the ideal time to deliver structured caregiver training . FUNDING Medical Research Council. ABSTRACT  Differential enrollment into clinical trials by gender has been described previously . In 1993 , the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) Revitalization Act was enacted to promote the inclusion of women in clinical trials . A systematic search was conducted of all articles published in the Original Articles section of The New Engl and Journal of Medicine from 1994 to 1999 . On average , 24.6 % women were enrolled . Gender-specific data analysis was performed in 14 % of the trials .. ABSTRACT  The primary composite end point was the time until death from cardiovascular causes or major thrombotic events . The secondary end points were cardiovascular events , cardiovascular hospitalizations , incidence of cancer , progression to myelofibrosis , myelodysplasia or leukemic transformation , and hemorrhage . An intention-to-treat analysis was performed . There was no significant between-group difference in the rate of adverse events .

ABSTRACT  Pilot studies of treatment with arsenic trioxide with or without ATRA have shown high efficacy and reduced hematologic toxicity . The study was design ed as a noninferiority trial to show that the difference between the rates of event-free survival at 2 years in the two groups was not greater than 5 % . The median follow-up was 34.4 months . Overall survival was also better with ATRA-arsenic trioxide ( P=0.02 ) . As compared with ATRA-chemotherapy , ATRA-arsenic trioxide was associated with less hematologic toxicity and fewer infections but with more hepatic toxicity . CONCLUSIONS ATRA plus arsenic trioxide is at least not inferior and may be superior to ATRA plus chemotherapy in the treatment of patients with low-to-intermediate-risk APL .

ABSTRACT  BACKGROUND Among patients with Alzheimer 's disease who have had a response to antipsychotic medication for psychosis or agitation-aggression , the risk of a recurrence of symptoms after discontinuation of the medication has not been established . METHODS Patients with Alzheimer 's disease and psychosis or agitation-aggression received open-label treatment with risperidone for 16 weeks . The primary outcome was the time to relapse of psychosis or agitation . RESULTS A total of 180 patients received open-label  risperidone ( mean dose , 0.97 mg daily ) . The severity of psychosis and agitation were reduced , although there was a mild increase in extrapyramidal signs ;  112 patients met the criteria for response to treatment , of whom 110 underwent r and omization . CONCLUSIONS In patients with Alzheimer 's disease who had psychosis or agitation that had responded to risperidone therapy for 4 to 8 months , discontinuation of risperidone was associated with an increased risk of relapse . ( Funded by the National Institutes of Health and others ; Clinical Trials.gov number , NCT00417482 . ). ABSTRACT  Semagacestat is a small-molecule \\u03b3-secretase inhibitor that was developed as a potential treatment for Alzheimer 's disease . A mixed-model repeated- measures analysis was used . RESULTS The trial was terminated before completion on the basis of a recommendation by the data and safety monitoring board . At termination , there were 189 patients in the group receiving placebo  , 153 patients in the group receiving 100 mg of semagacestat , and 121 patients in the group receiving 140 mg of semagacestat . CONCLUSIONS As compared with placebo , semagacestat did not improve cognitive status , and patients receiving the higher dose had significant worsening of functional ability . Semagacestat was associated with more adverse events , including skin cancers and infections . ( Funded by Eli Lilly ; Clinical Trials.gov number , NCT00594568 .. ABSTRACT  BACKGROUND Interferon-free regimens would be a major advance in the treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) infection . The primary end point was a sustained virologic response 12 weeks after the completion of therapy . The sustained virologic response 12 weeks after the completion of therapy did not differ significantly according to treatment duration or dosage among ribavirin-containing regimens . This response was significantly higher with TID28W than with TID28W-NR ( P=0.03 ) . Rash , photosensitivity , nausea , vomiting , and diarrhea were the most common adverse events .

ABSTRACT  BACKGROUND The treatment of relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) has result ed in few durable remissions . Bruton 's tyrosine kinase ( BTK ) , an essential component of B-cell-receptor signaling , mediates interactions with the tumor microenvironment and promotes the survival and proliferation of CLL cells . A total of 85 patients , the majority of whom were considered to have high-risk disease , received ibrutinib orally once daily ; 51 received 420 mg , and 34 received 840 mg . The response was independent of clinical and genomic risk factors present before treatment , including advanced-stage disease , the number of previous therapies , and the 17p13.1 deletion . At 26 months , the estimated progression-free survival rate was 75 % and the rate of overall survival was 83 % . CONCLUSIONS Ibrutinib was associated with a high frequency of durable remissions in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL and small lymphocytic lymphoma , including patients with high-risk genetic lesions .

ABSTRACT  BACKGROUND For patients with smoldering multiple myeloma , the st and ard of care is observation until symptoms develop . However , this approach does not identify high-risk patients who may benefit from early intervention . The primary end point was time to progression to symptomatic disease . Secondary end points were response rate , overall survival , and safety . A partial response or better was achieved in 79 % of patients in the treatment group after the induction phase and in 90 % during the maintenance phase . Toxic effects were mainly grade 2 or lower . CONCLUSIONS Early treatment for patients with high-risk smoldering myeloma delays progression to active disease and increases overall survival .

ABSTRACT  We assessed cardiovascular outcomes with alogliptin , a new inhibitor of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 ( DPP-4 ) , as compared with placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes who had had a recent acute coronary syndrome . RESULTS A total of 5380 patients underwent r and omization and were followed for up to 40 months ( median , 18 months ) . Glycated hemoglobin levels were significantly lower with alogliptin than with placebo ( mean difference , -0.36 percentage points ; P<0.001 ) . Incidences of hypoglycemia , cancer , pancreatitis , and initiation of dialysis were similar with alogliptin and placebo .

ABSTRACT  BACKGROUND Although P2Y12 antagonists are effective in patients with non-ST-segment elevation ( NSTE ) acute coronary syndromes , the effect of the timing of administration -- before or after coronary angiography -- is not known . We evaluated the effect of administering the P2Y12 antagonist prasugrel at the time of diagnosis versus administering it after the coronary angiography if percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) was indicated . Patients were r and omly assigned to receive prasugrel ( a 30-mg loading dose ) before the angiography ( pretreatment group ) or placebo ( control group ) . When PCI was indicated , an additional 30 mg of prasugrel was given in the pretreatment group at the time of PCI and 60 mg of prasugrel was given in the control group . The rates of TIMI major bleeding and life-threatening bleeding not related to CABG were increased by a factor of 3 and 6 , respectively . Pretreatment did not reduce the rate of the primary outcome among patients undergoing PCI ( 69 % of the patients ) but increased the rate of TIMI major bleeding at 7 days . All the results were confirmed at 30 days and in prespecified subgroups . ( Funded by Daiichi Sankyo and Eli Lilly ; ACCOAST Clinical Trials.gov number , NCT01015287 . ). ABSTRACT  BACKGROUND Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ( IPF ) is a progressive , fatal disorder of unknown cause with no effective treatment . Cough affects up to 80 % of patients with IPF , is frequently disabling , and lacks effective therapy . OBJECTIVE To determine the efficacy of thalidomide in suppressing cough in patients with IPF . DESIGN 24-week , double-blind , 2-treatment , 2-period crossover trial . ( Clinical Trials.gov registration number : NCT00600028 ) SETTING 1 university center . MEASUREMENTS The primary end point was cough-specific quality of life measured by the Cough Quality of Life Question naire ( CQLQ ) . For all measures , lower scores equaled improved cough or respiratory quality of life . LIMITATION This was a single-center study of short duration and small sample size focused on symptom-specific quality of life . CONCLUSION Thalidomide improved cough and respiratory quality of life in patients with IPF . A larger trial is warranted to assess these promising results .

OBJECTIVE To compare extended prophylaxis with aspirin and dalteparin for prevention of symptomatic venous thromboembolism ( VTE )  after THA . R and omization was electronically generated ; patients were assigned to a treatment group through a Web-based program . ( Current Controlled Trials : IS RCT N11902170 ) . SETTING 12 tertiary care orthopedic referral centers in Canada . PATIENTS 778 patients who had elective unilateral THA between 2007 and 2010 . MEASUREMENTS Symptomatic VTE confirmed by objective testing ( primary efficacy outcome ) and bleeding . Aspirin was noninferior ( P < 0.001 ) but not superior ( P = 0.22 ) to dalteparin . LIMITATION The study was halted prematurely because of difficulty with patient recruitment . Given its low cost and greater convenience , aspirin may be considered a reasonable alternative for extended thromboprophylaxis after THA .

            " Here , we compared the therapeutic efficacy of human embryonic stem cell-derived MSCs ( hESC-MSCs ) with adult BM-MSCs for the treatment of PAH in an animal model . At 1 week posttransplantation , the number of engrafted MSCs in the lungs was found significantly higher in the hESC-MSC group than in the BM-MSC group ( all p < 0.01 ) . At 3 weeks posttransplantation , implanted BM-MSCs were undetectable whereas hESC-MSCs were not only engrafted in injured pulmonary arteries but had also undergone endothelial differentiation . In addition , protein profiling of hESC-MSC- and BM-MSC-conditioned medium revealed a differential paracrine capacity . Classification of these factors into bioprocesses revealed that secreted factors from hESC-MSCs were preferentially involved in early embryonic development and tissue differentiation , especially blood vessel morphogenesis . We concluded that improved cell survival and paracrine capacity of hESC-MSCs provide better therapeutic efficacy than BM-MSCs in the treatment for PAH. ABSTRACT  Abstract We investigated the effect of adipose-derived stem cells ( ADSCs ) transplantation effects on structural remodeling and pulmonary artery pressure in  monocrotaline (MCT)-induced pulmonary hypertensive rats . In the first experiment , 32 male Sprague-Dawley ( SD ) rats were r and omly divided into four groups ( n = 8/group ) : 3 ADSCs treated groups and normal control ( Ctrl ) . ADSCs were administered through the left jugular vein at 105 , 106 and 107 cells , respectively , and a cell density of 106cells/ml was shown to be optimal . The GFP-tagged ADSCs were identified in the lungs and differentiated into endothelial-like cells . In the second experiment , 96 male SD rats were r and omly divided into three groups ( n = 32/group ) : Ctrl , MCT-induced pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ) , and PAH treated with ADSCs ( ADSCs ) . Two weeks post-MCT administration , the ADSCs group received 1 × 106 ADSCs via the external jugular vein . In summary , ADSCs may colonize the pulmonary arteries , attenuate pulmonary arterial hypertension and ameliorate pulmonary arterial remodeling. ABSTRACT  The animals were r and omly divided into 3 groups : control , PAH  and  BMSC implantation  groups . The mechanism may be executed via paracrine effects. ABSTRACT  OBJECTIVE To characterize mortality in persons diagnosed with primary pulmonary hypertension and to investigate factors associated with survival . DESIGN Registry with prospect i ve follow-up . Patients were followed for survival at 6-month intervals . MAIN RESULTS The estimated median survival of these patients was 2.8 years ( 95 % Cl , 1.9 to 3.7 years ) . Drug therapy at entry or discharge was not associated with survival duration . Such an equation , once vali date d prospect ively , could be used as an adjunct in planning treatment strategies and allocating medical re sources. ABSTRACT  The primary end point was the change from baseline to week 12 in the distance walked in six minutes . The change in mean pulmonary-artery pressure and World Health Organization ( WHO ) functional class and the incidence of clinical worsening were also assessed , but the study was not powered to assess mortality . Patients completing the 12-week r and omized study could enter a long-term extension study . The incidence of clinical worsening did not differ significantly between the patients treated with sildenafil and those treated with placebo .. ABSTRACT  BACKGROUND Current therapies for pulmonary arterial hypertension have been adopted on the basis of short-term trials with exercise capacity as the primary end point . We assessed the efficacy of macitentan , a new dual endothelin-receptor antagonist , using a primary end point of morbidity and mortality in a long-term trial . Stable use of oral or inhaled therapy for pulmonary arterial hypertension , other than endothelin-receptor antagonists , was allowed at study entry . RESULTS A total of 250 patients were r and omly assigned to placebo , 250 to the 3-mg macitentan dose , and 242 to the 10-mg macitentan dose . The primary end point occurred in 46.4 % , 38.0 % , and 31.4 % of the patients in these groups , respectively . Worsening of pulmonary arterial hypertension was the most frequent primary end-point event . The effect of macitentan on this end point was observed regardless of whether the patient was receiving therapy for pulmonary arterial hypertension at baseline . Adverse events more frequently associated with macitentan than with placebo were headache , nasopharyngitis , and anemia . CONCLUSIONS Macitentan significantly reduced morbidity and mortality among patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension in this event-driven study . ( Funded by Actelion Pharmaceuticals ; SERAPHIN Clinical Trials.gov number , NCT00660179 . ). ABSTRACT  Our previous studies have shown that bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells ( BMSCs ) can inhibit the progression of pulmonary artery hypertension ( PAH ) in the monocrotaline ( MCT ) model in the short term . The aim of this study was to further investigate the long-term effect of BMSCs on PAH and to explore the mechanism of the protective effect including the pulmonary vascular remodeling and cell differentiation . PAH model was established by subcutaneous injection of 50 mg/kg MCT as previously study . Postoperatively , the animals were r and omly divided into three groups ( n = 10 in each group ) : control , PAH group , and BMSCs implantation group . Immunofluorescence showed that the cells have the ability to differentiate between von Willebr and factor and vascular endothelial growth factor . Six months after intravenous injection , BMSCs could significantly improve pulmonary function by inhibiting the ventricular remodeling and the effect of cell differentiation. ABSTRACT  Experimental data suggest that transplantation of EPCs attenuates monocrotaline-induced pulmonary hypertension in rats and dogs . Thirteen children with IPAH received intravenous infusion of autologous EPCs . PVR decreased by approximately 19 % from 1118 + /- 537 to 906 + /- 377 dyn s/cm(5 ) ( p = 0.047 ) . CO increased from 3.39 + /- 0.79 to 3.85 + /- 0.42 L/min ( p = 0.048 ) . The 6-MWD increased by 39 m from 359 + /- 82 to 399 + /- 74 m ( p = 0.012 ) . NYHA functional class also improved . There were no severe adverse events with cell infusion . Confirmation of these results in a r and omized controlled trial are essential. ABSTRACT  BACKGROUND Uncontrolled studies suggested that aerosolized iloprost , a stable analogue of prostacyclin , causes selective pulmonary vasodilatation and improves hemodynamics and exercise capacity in patients with pulmonary hypertension . METHODS We compared repeated daily inhalations of 2.5 or 5.0 microg of iloprost ( six or nine times per day ; median inhaled dose , 30 microg per day ) with inhalation of placebo . A total of 203 patients with selected forms of severe pulmonary arterial hypertension and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension ( New York Heart Association [ NYHA ] functional class III or IV ) were included . RESULTS The combined clinical end point was met by 16.8 percent of the patients receiving iloprost , as compared with 4.9 percent of the patients receiving placebo ( P=0.007 ) . There were increases in the distance walked in six minutes of 36.4 m in the iloprost group as a whole ( P=0.004 ) and of 58.8 m in the subgroup of patients with primary pulmonary hypertension . As compared with base-line values , hemodynamic values were significantly improved at 12 weeks when measured after iloprost inhalation ( P<0.001 ) , were largely unchanged when measured before iloprost inhalation , and were significantly worse in the placebo group . Further significant beneficial effects of iloprost treatment included an improvement in the NYHA class ( P=0.03 ) , dyspnea ( P=0.015 ) , and quality of life ( P=0.026 ) . Syncope occurred with similar frequency in the two groups but was more frequently rated as serious in the iloprost group , although this adverse effect was not associated with clinical deterioration . CONCLUSIONS Inhaled iloprost is an effective therapy for patients with severe pulmonary hypertension. ABSTRACT  Furthermore , PVR may increase long after the Fontan operation . METHODS AND RESULTS This was a prospect i ve , multicenter study . Cardiac catheterization was performed before and after administration of sildenafil in all patients . After the Fontan operation , a  six minute walk test  ( 6MWT ) was also performed . A total of 42 patients were enrolled . No major side effects were observed in any patients . CONCLUSIONS Sildenafil reduced PVR in patients with single ventricle physiology . Long-term clinical significance warrants further study. ABSTRACT  BACKGROUND Pulmonary arterial hypertension is a life-threatening and progressive disease with limited treatment options . Endothelin is a vasoconstrictor and smooth muscle cell mitogen that plays a critical role in the pathogenesis and progression of PAH . RESULTS At 12 weeks , ambrisentan increased 6MWD ( + 36.1 m , p < 0.0001 ) with similar and statistically significant increases for each dose group ( range , + 33.9 to + 38.1 m ) . Adverse events were mild and unrelated to dose , including the incidence of elevated serum aminotransferase concentrations > 3 times the upper limit of normal ( 3.1 % ) . CONCLUSIONS Ambrisentan appears to improve exercise capacity , symptoms , and hemodynamics in patients with PAH . The incidence and severity of liver enzyme abnormalities appear to be low. ABSTRACT  In the present study , we investigated the early effect of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells ( BMSCs ) on experimental high blood flow-induced PAH model rats and discussed the mechanism . BMSCs were isolated , cultured from bone marrow of Sprague-Dawley ( SD ) rat . The animal model of PAH was created by surgical methods to produce a left-to-right shunt .. ABSTRACT  Pulmonary arterial hypertension is a life-threatening disease for which continuous intravenous prostacyclin has proven to be effective . However , this treatment requires a permanent central venous catheter with the associated risk of serious complications such as sepsis , thromboembolism , or syncope . Treprostinil , a stable prostacyclin analogue , can be administered by a continuous subcutaneous infusion , avoiding these risks . Improvement in exercise capacity was greater in the sicker patients and was dose-related , but independent of disease etiology . Concomitantly , treprostinil significantly improved indices of dyspnea , signs and symptoms of pulmonary hypertension , and hemodynamics . The most common side effect attributed to treprostinil was infusion site pain ( 85 % ) leading to premature discontinuation from the study in 8 % of patients . Three patients in the treprostinil treatment group presented with an episode of gastrointestinal hemorrhage . We conclude that chronic subcutaneous infusion of treprostinil is an effective treatment with an acceptable safety profile in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension. ABSTRACT  BACKGROUND Endothelin 1 , a powerful endogenous vasoconstrictor and mitogen , might be a cause of pulmonary hypertension . The primary endpoint was change in exercise capacity . Analysis was by intention to treat . The improvement was maintained for at least 20 weeks . Patients given bosentan had a reduced Borg dyspnoea index and an improved WHO functional class . All three withdrawals from clinical worsening were in the placebo group ( p=0.033 ) . The number and nature of adverse events did not differ between the two groups .. ABSTRACT  A similar initiative is warranted in the field of animal experimentation . Methods We provide an RoB tool for animal intervention studies ( SYRCLE ’s RoB tool ) . This tool is based on the Cochrane RoB tool and has been adjusted for aspects of bias that play a specific role in animal intervention studies . To enhance transparency and applicability , we formulated signalling questions to facilitate judgment . Results The result ing RoB tool  for animal studies contains 10 entries . These entries are related to selection bias , performance bias , detection bias , attrition bias , reporting bias and other biases . Half these items are in agreement with the items in the Cochrane RoB tool . Most of the variations between the two tools are due to differences in design between RCTs and animal studies . Shortcomings in , or unfamiliarity with , specific aspects of experimental design of animal studies compared to clinical studies also play a role . Conclusions SYRCLE ’s RoB tool is an adapted version of the Cochrane RoB tool . Widespread adoption and implementation of this tool will facilitate and improve critical appraisal of evidence from animal studies .\n"

Analysis was by intention to treat . The improvement was maintained for at least 20 weeks . Patients given bosentan had a reduced Borg dyspnoea index and an improved WHO functional class . All three withdrawals from clinical worsening were in the placebo group ( p=0.033 ) . The number and nature of adverse events did not differ between the two groups .. ABSTRACT  A similar initiative is warranted in the field of animal experimentation . Methods We provide an RoB tool for animal intervention studies ( SYRCLE ’s RoB tool ) . This tool is based on the Cochrane RoB tool and has been adjusted for aspects of bias that play a specific role in animal intervention studies . To enhance transparency and applicability , we formulated signalling questions to facilitate judgment . Results The result ing RoB tool  for animal studies contains 10 entries . These entries are related to selection bias , performance bias , detection bias , attrition bias , reporting bias and other biases . Half these items are in agreement with the items in the Cochrane RoB tool . Most of the variations between the two tools are due to differences in design between RCTs and animal studies . Shortcomings in , or unfamiliarity with , specific aspects of experimental design of animal studies compared to clinical studies also play a role . Conclusions SYRCLE ’s RoB tool is an adapted version of the Cochrane RoB tool . Widespread adoption and implementation of this tool will facilitate and improve critical appraisal of evidence from animal studies .'"
